Title: Gżira firm is focal point of ‘large-scale’ investigation
Body: A financial institution in Gżira is a focal point of an international investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network,” Times of Malta can reveal. Police this week carried out searches at Papaya, an e-money company suspected of offering ‘money-laundering services’ to the criminal network. Although certain details about the international probe have been disclosed, Papaya has not yet been publicly named as the financial institution in question. EuroJust, the EU’s criminal justice cooperation agency, said at least €4.5 million were laundered through Malta since the end of 2015, though the total sum could amount to “tens of millions of euros”. Investigators are combing through Papaya’s list of account holders and transactions as part of the ongoing probe, sources told Times of Malta. National authorities in Malta, Latvia, Germany, France and Italy conducted more than 100 searches in a large-scale operation against the alleged criminal network. EuroJust said this week that the Maltese financial institution, in reference to Papaya, and the “organised crime group behind it” offered “money-laundering services” via a network of fake companies. Corporate records name Latvian national Dmitry Panurksis as Papaya’s owner. Panurksis did not respond to a request for comment by Times of Malta. Lawyer Tonio Fenech, who was a director of Papaya for a number of years, said he resigned from his role in the first half of 2023.   “I would therefore ask you to refer your questions to whoever represents the company as per the registry of companies,” Fenech said when contacted. Investigations were initiated in 2021 by the Latvian authorities after they noticed unusual money transfers from Latvia to Malta. Simultaneously, the German authorities started investigations into suspicious money flows to Malta. Papaya CEO hit by sanctions Papaya was set up in 2012 by Frederic Villa, a Swiss national who resides in Malta. He relinquished ownership of Papaya in 2016, however stayed on as its CEO and director. In February 2023, Villa was hit with sanctions by the US government. That same month, the Maltese authorities were tipped off about an alleged “plot” in 2022 to launder tens of millions of euros in Russian cash through Malta. Villa was named in the intelligence tip off as one of the potential parties to the “plot”.   When contacted, Villa strongly denied involvement in or knowledge of any such plot.   “I never, in any way, shape or form endorsed, engaged in or somehow approved any form of money laundering nor did I ever allow the companies in which I was involved to be so involved,” Villa said. Villa was among dozens of individuals and companies sanctioned by the United States in 2023, as part of an effort to target companies and people providing “material support” to Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. He was placed on the sanctions list over his role as a director of a Maltese company called Stratton Investment Group, which held an account at Papaya. Russia links Stratton’s parent company is believed by the US to have been involved in “covert procurement schemes” to supply sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russian intelligence service and the Russian military. The parent company is owned by Swiss-Italian businessman Walter Moretti, who was also sanctioned. Villa told Times of Malta he had been placed on the US sanctions list solely due to his role as a director of Stratton. He said Stratton had been dormant for two years prior to the sanctioning.  Intelligence passed on to the Maltese authorities identified the need for further information on Stratton’s banking activities, particularly at Papaya. Villa said the only transaction Stratton was involved in was a €4.3 million one with a UK company, and all the necessary anti-money laundering checks had been carried. “All this information has been given to the authorities, after my sanctioning. There has been full transparency. Since my sanctioning, I have resigned from the directorship of Stratton, and have had no further contact with Mr Moretti.”   Villa said he had also immediately resigned from Integritas, a corporate service provider he owns, that provided services to Stratton and Moretti. Villa said he did this to be able to focus on taking all the required and necessary steps to clear his name both locally and internationally.   He also relinquished his role as Papaya’s CEO and director after being sanctioned in February 2023. Malta’s anti-money laundering unit last year fined Papaya €279,000 for its “minimal” regard towards its anti-money laundering obligations.   The FIAU said documents collected to support transactions taking place were deemed “inadequate” and, at times, created “more doubts rather than clarifications” regarding the transactions taking place at Papaya. In one example, the FIAU noted how a loan agreement between two Papaya customers for €700,000 was “updated” to €7 million. The FIAU said the loan agreements in place shed little light on the purpose of the loans. It said Papaya failed to scrutinise loan documents and the transactions taking place, in breach of its legal obligations. Papaya subsequently appealed the fine.

Title: Maltese man wanted by the FBI for malware charges appeals US extradition
Body: A Maltese man wanted by the FBI for selling malware on the dark web has appealed his extradition to the United States after previously having consented.  Daniel John Meli, 27, of Żabbar was arrested on February 7 and subsequently arraigned on February 9, after US prosecutors accused him of selling malware products, including the Pegasus remote access trojan (RAT) to cybercriminals.  Initially, Meli consented to be extradited to face the charges but had a change of heart after he got new lawyers, filing an appeal to overturn the extradition order.  In an application signed by Marion Camilleri and Arthur Azzopardi, Meli’s lawyers argue that while the first court had been satisfied that the man had consented to the extradition of his own volition, they alleged that it had failed to ensure that he had fully understood what he was consenting to, namely being put on a plane to the US to face hefty charges that could land him up to 40-years in prison far away from home, if found guilty.  Meli, they argued, has a documented history of mental health issues, takes regular medication to treat these issues and was previously admitted to both Mater Dei and Mount Carmel hospitals.  With this context, the court should have assured that Meli was in a sound enough state to understand what was being asked of him when he consented to the extradition and cast doubt on whether this could truly be considered voluntary in such circumstances.  Meli’s legal team also invoked the principle of territoriality, arguing that the allegations made against him indicated that if the alleged crimes had occurred, they had happened in Malta and by a Maltese citizen.  Therefore, if the Maltese state found the evidence brought to it by the FBI to be credible and compelling, it had an obligation to investigate and charge the man for these alleged crimes in Malta before he could ever be extradited to face these charges overseas.  Judge Neville Camilleri is expected to rule on the appeal next week.  American authorities suspect Meli has been selling malware online since “at least 2012”, but started building the case against him in February 2022, when he allegedly sold the software to an undercover FBI operative for $180 in Bitcoin. He is now facing charges of conspiracy, obtaining unauthorised access to protected computers to obtain information, illegally selling an interception device, and illegally advertising an interception device.  Each of these charges carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of causing unauthorised damage to protected computers provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.  The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Europol were among a number of international police forces to have worked together on Meli’s arrest.  Another man, Prince Onyeoziri Odinakachi, 31, was also arrested in Nigeria earlier this month for allegedly having provided customer support to those who purchased and made use of the malware.

Title: Fr Luke Seguna claims court has breached his rights by losing his laptop
Body: Marsaxlokk parish priest Luke Seguna has filed an urgent constitutional case claiming a breach of his right to a fair trial after his laptop went missing from the law courts’ exhibit room. The priest, who is facing fraud charges, also claimed that other evidence seized by the police when they had started their investigations was never passed on to court-appointed experts and that the chain of custody of such important proof had been lost. The case was filed after a court heard on Tuesday that the court-seized laptop – a MacBook Pro – could not be found in the law courts’ exhibit room. Court expert Keith Cutajar told Magistrate Rachel Montebello how he was nominated by the court to examine the contents of the laptop but when he asked the exhibits’ officer for the device, it could not be found. The laptop was exhibited in court by the prosecution on June 19 last year. Since it is bulky it is not kept with the court documents but sent to the exhibits’ room after a registration number is allocated to it.   Cutajar said that, when he asked for the laptop and produced the relevant dates and number, he was told by the exhibit officer “we can’t find the laptop”. The magistrate ordered that the exhibits’ officer be summoned to testify in the next sitting together with the police officer who exhibited it. The court expert was testifying in the compilation of evidence against Fr Luke Seguna who is facing charges of fraud, misappropriation and money laundering, with prosecutors claiming he swindled some 150 of his parishioners out of around €500,000 over a 10-year-span. He is denying the charges. In an urgent application filed in the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, Seguna claimed that his right to a fair trial had been breached when the laptop went missing. He and other documentary evidence seized by the police were also never passed on to the inquiring magistrate, in blatant breach of the basic responsibility of the investigating officer to preserve the chain of custody of such evidence. Seguna’s lawyers Jose Herrera, Matthew Xuereb and David Camilleri insisted that the administrative shortcomings began when the police failed to inform the inquiring magistrate so that documentary evidence is conserved by court-appointed experts. The missing laptop and missing documents seized from the Marsaxlokk parish home by the police were important to prove his innocence. The laptop was analysed by the police, who are not court experts and there is no peace of mind about what the police had done with it, the lawyers claimed. They said that all these shortcomings were failing to ensure that their client is afforded a fair trial and called on the court to decree on the matter. Over a number of sittings since last August, numerous parishioners testified about the valuable work done by Fr Luke for the parish church and the people of Marsaxlokk, some saying that they missed his charitable acts.   Witnesses said that they willingly donated funds under the “arbural” system, while others explained that they used to donate money to the priest to be used by him as he best deemed fit. However, prosecutors claim that the priest held hundreds of thousands of euros in various bank accounts, together with a collection of five motorbikes and two cars, despite a relatively meagre income as a clergyman. Several suspicious bank transactions had triggered police investigations in his regard. Some €148,000 were allegedly traced to payment processing companies linked to a porn site, while police also tracked down several cheques totalling around €18,000 issued by a third party to the priest.

Title: UK police make record drugs seizure
Body: British police said Friday that they had made what is believed to be its biggest ever seizure of serious drugs. The National Crime Agency said that 5,700 kg of cocaine were found in a container at the port of Southampton on England's south coast on February 8. The drug haul was discovered hidden in a cargo of bananas that had been transported from South America, the agency said in a statement. It had an estimated value of £450 million (€526 million) based on UK street prices, the NCA added. Officers believe the drugs were heading to Hamburg in Germany "for onward delivery", the statement said. "This record-breaking seizure will represent a huge hit to the international organised crime cartels involved, denying them massive profits," said NCA director Chris Farrimond. The previous largest seizure of drugs in the UK was 3.7 tonnes of cocaine found in Southampton in 2022. The NCA estimates that criminal gangs make around £4 billion a year from Britain's illegal cocaine market. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Scam reports more than double in a year, €12.5m lost in 2023
Body: The number of online scams reported to the police more than doubled over the past year, highlighting the ever-growing threat posed by online fraudsters. Speaking in parliament earlier this week, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri revealed that there were 2,517 cases of online fraud reported to the police throughout 2023, far more than the 1,088 reported in 2022. Camilleri was replying to a parliamentary question submitted by PN MP Darren Carabott. This means that people in Malta lost some €12.5m to scams and online fraud in 2023, almost 50% higher than the €8.5m they lost in 2022, according to figures provided by the police.  RELATED STORIES  The true figure is likely to be even higher, with international research suggesting that around a third of all scams go unreported. Online scams have proliferated in recent years, rising from just a handful each year a decade ago, to over 2,500 today, as technology developed throughout the years. A police spokesperson told Times of Malta that many of the more successful scams tend to be bank message scams, where scammers use what initially appears to be a genuine message from a trusted bank to gain access to people’s savings. The success of these scams “can be attributed to scammers exploiting the trust victims have in financial institutions”, the spokesperson warned. Scammers are becoming increasingly adept at spoofing banks’ communication channels, frequently sending customers fake messages from what appears to be a bank’s real telephone number. Unsuspecting customers, believing the message to be genuine, are then duped into handing over their personal details or money, sometimes to the tune of thousands of euros. Police say that scammers often use “urgency tactics”, such as claiming that a person has to perform a certain action within a specific time period or risk losing access to their accounts. According to the police, scammers often target people “who rely heavily on digital banking”, further increasing their chance of success. The “vast majority” of these scams tend to originate from overseas, according to the police. This often makes it more difficult for authorities to trace transactions and recover stolen money. New guidelines published by the Financial Arbiter late last year say that banks can be held liable in cases in which their customers are scammed, if they fail to adequately warn customers about scams imitating their communication channels. In one such case last year, BOV were instructed to pay 40% of one client’s losses, after the client clicked on a link in a fraudulent SMS they believed to be sent by the bank, eventually losing over €4,000 to the scam. The move is likely to see banks step up their communication in an effort to warn their clients of scams that are doing the rounds.

Title: Pupils injured in attack at German school, suspect detained
Body: Several pupils were injured in an attack at a school in the western German city of Wuppertal on Thursday, police said, with local media reporting that the assailant was a knife-wielding fellow student. A suspect had been taken into custody following the attack, police said, without confirming the person's identity or the weapon used. "We are on site with a large number of officers. There are injured school children," Wuppertal police said on X, formerly Twitter. No exact number of pupils injured was immediately provided but police told local paper Wuppertaler Rundschau that it remained in "single digits".  Local media reported the suspect had attacked pupils at the school with a knife. The alleged attacker was a pupil at the school, according to German daily Bild.

Title: Man accused of stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept 
Body: A 63-year-old man was remanded in custody on Thursday after denying stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept. Robert Frendo from Paola was arraigned in front of Magistrate Nadine Lia on Thursday charged with the attempted murder of his brother-in-law, Joseph Seychell, in the house where they both live. Inspector Keith Rizzo told the court he had responded to a request for assistance on February 20 in Triq Lampuka in Paola, where he found an ambulance on site and a doctor treating the alleged victim. Seychell told the inspector that Frendo had stabbed him multiple times in his sleep. Later, Rizzo said that Frendo was apprehended by the police and he spoke to him at the police station where he informed him of his rights. The accused was also charged with causing grievous injuries to Seychell and causing him to fear violence as well as carrying a weapon. When asked to confirm his identity to the court, Frendo paused before declaring that he was “guilty”, although he had not been asked to enter a plea. Before the standard questioning could continue, the proceedings were briefly suspended as Frendo was hauled away by his lawyer. Subsequently, after proceedings continued, lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar replied that the accused was choosing to plead not guilty and that the accused had previously “misunderstood the court”. Addressing members of the media present in the courtroom, Magistrate Lia told reporters that the case should not be “prejudicated” by Frendo’s earlier statement and that the official plea was the one registered after consultation with his lawyer. No request for bail was made. Police inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo as well as AG lawyers Nathaniel Falzon and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Adreana Zammit and Marion Camilleri appeared parte civile.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Australian bishop charged with sex crimes
Body: An Australian bishop is facing accusations of rape and indecent assault, becoming one of the most senior Catholics in the country to be charged with sex crimes.   Emeritus Bishop Christopher Alan Saunders was arrested in Western Australia on Wednesday evening after a high-powered internal Vatican investigation spurred child abuse detectives into action.  Police said he has been charged with 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault and two counts of sexual penetration without consent -- a legal term for rape. The 74-year-old, who is due to front court on Thursday, has also been charged with three counts of "indecently dealing with a child" between 16 and 18 years old. Archbishop of Perth Timothy Costelloe, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said the allegations were "deeply distressing".  "It is right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated," he said in a statement.  Court documents show Saunders' alleged offences took place between 2008 and 2014.  For more than 20 years, Saunders presided over the Diocese of Broome, a sweeping coastal region in northwest Australia dotted with dozens of remote Aboriginal communities.  He stood down as bishop in 2020 when allegations of sexual abuse first surfaced in local media - but retained the honorary title of "emeritus bishop". An initial police investigation failed to unearth sufficient evidence to charge Saunders, who has been steadfast in his denials.  But with persistent rumours swirling around the clergyman, the Vatican launched its own probe in 2022 using sweeping powers first established by Pope Francis.  The "Vos estis lux mundi" powers - meaning "You are the light of the world" in Latin - were drawn up in 2019 to help the church investigate sexual abuse accusations at the highest levels.  The confidential church findings were later shared with police, who subsequently re-opened their investigation.  George Pell, the late Australian cardinal and Vatican powerbroker, was imprisoned on sexual abuse charges in 2019 - but his convictions were quashed the next year.

Title: Eurojust suspects Maltese company laundered millions for criminal ring
Body: A Maltese financial institution laundered at least €4.5 million in proceeds from criminal activities since the end of 2015, a pan-European police investigation has concluded. “The total sum of laundered money could amount to tens of millions of euros,” Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, said on Wednesday. The unnamed firm was searched by police officers assisted by German counterparts, as part of a massive police operation involving more than 100 searches across five countries.  National authorities in Latvia, Germany, France, Italy and Malta carried out more than 100 searches in a large-scale operation against a Russian-Eurasian criminal network and a Maltese-based financial institution allegedly involved in money-laundering services. Estonia was also involved. Four suspects were detained during an action day supported by Eurojust and Europol. Potential suspects and witnesses were also interviewed in Latvia, Germany, Estonia and Malta. More than 460 police officers were deployed to carry out the searches with Germany also deploying four officers to support the investigations and searches in Latvia and Malta. In addition to the arrests, various bank accounts and properties were seized. Eurojust said that the Maltese financial institution and the organised crime group behind it offered money-laundering services via a network of fake enterprises and individuals who were registered directors, without performing any real business activities. The organised crime group operated mainly from Riga and Berlin. Investigations were initiated in 2021 by the Latvian authorities after they noticed unusual money transfers from Latvia to the Maltese financial institution.  Simultaneously, the German authorities started investigations into suspicious money flows involving the same financial institution. Eurojust said it supported the concerted action by setting up a coordination centre and establishing and funding a joint investigation team between the German and Latvian authorities. The agency also organised five dedicated coordination meetings to prepare for the action day and assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders in the countries involved. On Wednesday, Europol deployed a money laundering expert to Latvia and set up a mobile office at Eurojust’s coordination centre to support the operation.  Since December 2021, Europol has been supporting the investigation by providing operational and financial analysis and operational expertise. The agency also supported the joint investigation team and provided financial support to the case. Wednesday’s operations were carried out by the following authorities: You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Plea bargains: necessary evil or swift justice?
Body: Three men charged with gruesome crimes admitted to the charges following plea bargain agreements. Claudia Calleja questions the reason behind the process.  In 10 days of legal drama, three men facing life behind bars for three different murders admitted their guilt in exchange for reduced sentences, sparking questions about the intricacies of the so-called plea-bargaining process. Legal experts suggest that such agreements are often sought when defence lawyers perceive no viable escape routes for their clients. For the prosecution and victims’ families, plea bargains offer a quicker resolution, reduced expenses, and the invaluable testimony needed to bring other perpetrators to justice. “Sometimes the prosecution has damning evidence and there is no way out,” one lawyer said. Another added: “This [plea bargaining] is also as a result of media coverage leading to the accused being wary of risking life due to a preconditioned jury pool and thus opt to cut their losses and avoid life.” Recent data provided by the Justice Ministry showed 102 cases awaiting trial by jury until the beginning of February. They involved 119 individuals and the oldest case dated back to 2009.  Plea bargaining facilitates the administration of justice as it expedites cases and helps reduce this heavy backlog, according to lawyers Joe Giglio and Jason Azzopardi. “It benefits the victims because it brings closure without the need of putting them through a lengthy trial,” said Giglio. Taking a case before a panel of jurors, came with risks for both the defence and the prosecution, Azzopardi added. Stefano Filletti, Head of Department of Criminal Law at the University of Malta, explained that if the State (through the attorney general) – and the accused – came to a sentencing agreement, it was common practice that the AG took the wishes of the family of the injured party into account.   He said sentence bargaining and plea bargaining were essential tools in the administration of justice. First, they brought quicker closure to the victims and swifter justice to the accused and were also cost-effective. Data from 2016 showed that a trial cost about €3,000 per day. “When doing away with a trial by jury, the system becomes more efficient, quicker and less expensive,” Filletti said. There was another important function of sentence bargaining. If a co-accused admitted to a crime against a plea-bargaining agreement, then the AG could summon that person to testify – increasing the chances of conviction of others who did not admit. This is what happened on February 13, when Danish national Jesper Kristiansen, one of the three men awaiting trial for the 2020 Sliema double murder, admitted after agreeing to a plea deal of 40 years’ jail. He admitted to his involvement in the murder of Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski at their home in August 2020. Two other men are also facing murder charges. Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison. As his plea deal has now been formalised, he is able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. On February 15, Elliot Paul Busuttil, 40, from Attard admitted to murdering taxi driver Mario Farrugia, who was found dead in the trunk of his car two years ago, as well as the attempted murder of a second man, Emil Marinov. Farrugia, 62, from Pembroke, was stabbed more than 40 times and then left in the trunk of his car in a Qormi valley in April 2022. At the time, Busuttil was out on bail for the attempted murder of Bulgarian national Emil Marinov, who was found in Ta’ Qali in August 2020, after also being stabbed multiple times.  The court was informed that the prosecution and defence had agreed on a 35-year prison sentence. On February 4, Jeremie Camilleri admitted to having intentionally ran over Pelin Kaya and then threw stones at her dead body last year, reversing his initial not guilty plea. Kaya was mowed down by his BMW car as she walked home along Testaferrata Street, Gżira, hours into her 30th birthday celebration. His case will now be sent to a criminal court judge, who will sentence him. Camilleri faces up to a lifetime sentence in prison, though defence lawyers told the court they had reached an agreement with all parties, including the victim’s family. In an Instagram post, Kaya’s sister, Derya, confirmed that the family was consulted by the attorney general’s office about the plea bargaining and agreed. She wrote: “Pelin will never come back, and the pain will never go away. Even though we think the murderer deserves the harshest punishment, in order to ensure... the speedy conclusion considering the difficult and exhausting nature of the process we can confirm that we were consulted... We never want it to be thought that we have given up, we took this step so that our family can breathe a little.”   Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski – the brothers of murdered men Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski – said the news that one alleged killer pleaded guilty in exchange for a set jail term of 40 years “is the first step in bringing closure, although nothing can be done to bring the loved ones back”. Karl Grech, director of Victim Support Malta, said many victims view plea bargains with scepticism because they worry such agreements may allow offenders to receive lenient sentences, thus diminishing the sense of justice and accountability. For some, a trial represents a public acknowledgement of the harm they suffered and an opportunity for the offender to be held fully accountable. “The way a plea bargain is perceived can significantly affect a victim’s healing process. However, if the deal is seen as unjust or too lenient, it can exacerbate feelings of pain and anger, hindering recovery. “A significant challenge in assisting crime victims is the protracted duration from case initiation to its hearing, and ultimately, to sentencing. This extended timeline can exacerbate trauma for victims. Therefore, implementing measures to expedite the legal process could significantly alleviate the additional stress caused by drawn-out court proceedings,” he said.

Title: US police arrest child, 9, over deadly family shooting
Body: Police in the United States have arrested a nine-year-old child over the death of a family member who was shot in the head, officials said Tuesday. Emergency services raced to Tooele, in the Midwestern state of Utah on Friday evening where they found a 32-year-old man who had been grievously wounded. "He suffered from what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the head," said Officer Colbey Bentley of Tooele City Police Department. The man, who has not been identified, was rushed to hospital in nearby Salt Lake City but died from his injuries. "The investigation led to the arrest of a nine-year-old, who is a family member of the 32-year-old male," Bentley told AFP. The child, who also has not been named, was arrested some time on Friday evening. "We're looking into a potential charge of homicide," Bentley said. Firearms claim tens of thousands of lives every year in the United States, a country where there are more guns than people. Polls repeatedly show a majority of Americans are in favour of stricter rules on ownership, but a powerful gun lobby continues to hold Washington's political class in its grip.

Title: Youths in Floriana gang attack case placed under supervision order by court
Body: A judge on Monday issued a supervision order for six youths who allegedly ganged up against a 16-year-old boy, robbing him of cash and stabbing him with a penknife in a Floriana public garden on February 3. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera upheld a request by the attorney general’s office which asked the court to impose harsher bail conditions on the five girls and a boy who stand charged with the assault. Attorney general lawyer Kenneth Camilleri told the court during a hearing on an urgent application filed before the Court of Appeal that the first court had been “very lenient” with the accused, especially after having ignored the prosecution’s concerns about the strong possibility of tampering with evidence. In a decree, the judge said Magistrate Joe Mifsud was not wrong in using his discretion to release the youth on bail but should have imposed different bail conditions, especially since the alleged victim had not yet testified. Last Tuesday, the group, aged between 14 and 20, were charged in court after they were identified as the alleged aggressors behind the mugging that took place on the previous Saturday evening at around 7pm at a public garden just outside City Gate. Police from the Valletta station found the victim lying on the ground, with visible injuries to his face and hands. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sustained cut ligaments in his hands. His injuries were classified as grievous. The 14-year-old boy and five females – one aged 17 from Paola, two sisters aged 14 and 15 from Gżira, a 15-year-old from Valletta and 20-year-old Aicha Mariah from Paola – all pleaded not guilty. Three of the girls were charged with aggravated theft while the 20-year-old was separately charged with unlawful possession of the penknife as well as relapsing. The alleged victim was not only attacked but also robbed of his bag, containing some €90 in cash. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera placed all defendants under a supervision order to ensure they are followed closely throughout the course of the criminal case against them. Moreover, she ordered Aicha Mariah – the eldest of the group – to pay €500 as a bail deposit. The court retained the €2,000 personal guarantee, the curfew between 10pm and 6am, the order to sign the bail book once a week and the strict orders not to approach the victim in any manner. Lawyers Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb, Adreana Zammit, Ishmael Psaila, Dustin Camilleri and Alexia Attard were defence counsel.

Title: Youth charged with possession of 120 sachets of cocaine, heroin, cannabis
Body: A 21-year-old man was on Monday charged with the possession of 120 sachets of cocaine, heroin and cannabis with the intent to sell them in Marsa. Lean Mizzi, from Santa Lucia, pleaded not guilty to the possession of the drugs in circumstances denoting they were not for his personal use and relapsing. Police Inspectors Anthony Mercieca and John Leigh Howard said Mizzi was arrested following a tip-off. They told court there was a current trend of drug traffickers using young people to push drugs. “We found 120 sachets which meant he was going to sell to 120 people,” the police said. Mizzi was denied bail. Lawyer Amadeus Cachia appeared for Mizzi. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Watch: Palestinians accuse Israel of 'apartheid' at UN top court
Body: Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al-Maliki told the UN's top court Monday his people were suffering "colonialism and apartheid" under the Israelis, as judges weigh the legal consequences of Israel's occupation. "The Palestinians have endured colonialism and apartheid... There are those who are enraged by these words. They should be enraged by the reality we are suffering," Al-Maliki said. The ICJ is holding hearings all week on the legal implications of Israel's occupation since 1967, with an unprecedented 52 countries expected to give evidence.   Nations including the United States, Russia, and China will address judges at the Peace Palace in The Hague, seat of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The minister urged the court to declare the occupation illegal and order it to stop "immediately, totally and unconditionally." "Justice delayed is justice denied and the Palestinian people have been denied justice for far too long," he said.  "It is time to put an end to the double standards that have kept our people captive for far too long." In December 2022, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ for a non-binding "advisory opinion" on the "legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem." While any ICJ opinion would be non-binding, it comes amid mounting international legal pressure on Israel over the war in Gaza sparked by the brutal October 7 Hamas attacks. The hearings are separate from a high-profile case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocidal acts during the current Gaza offensive. The ICJ ruled in that case in January that Israel must do everything in its power to prevent genocide and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire. On Friday, it rejected South Africa's bid to impose additional measures on Israel, but reiterated the need to carry out the ruling in full. The UN General Assembly has asked the ICJ to consider two questions. Firstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called "the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination". This relates to the "prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967" and "measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem". In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. Israel then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory. The UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal. Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel. The ICJ has also been asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's "adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures." Secondly, the ICJ should advise on how Israel's actions "affect the legal status of the occupation" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries. The court will rule "urgently" on the affair, probably by the end of the year. The ICJ rules in disputes between states and its judgements are binding although it has little means to enforce them. However, in this case, the opinion it issues will be non-binding although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon. The ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia. It also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down. Israel is not participating in the hearings and reacted angrily to the 2022 UN request, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it "despicable" and "disgraceful". Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that while advisory opinions are non-binding, "they can carry great moral and legal authority" and can eventually be inscribed in international law.

Title: AG seeks harsher bail conditions for youths in gang attack
Body: The attorney general’s office has asked the court to impose harsher bail conditions on the five girls and a boy who allegedly ganged up against a 16-year-old boy, robbing him of cash and stabbing him with a penknife in a Floriana public garden. In an urgent application filed before the Court of Appeal, the AG asked the court to amend the bail conditions especially since the alleged victim had not yet testified.  Last Tuesday, the group, aged between 14 and 20, were charged in court after they were identified as the alleged aggressors behind the mugging that took place on the previous Saturday evening at around 7pm at a public garden just outside City Gate. Police from the Valletta station found the victim lying on the ground, with visible injuries to his face and hands.  He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sustained cut ligaments in his hands. His injuries were classified as grievous. The group appeared before Magistrate Joseph Mifsud charged with grievously injuring the victim and wilfully breaching the public peace.  The 14-year-old boy and five females – one aged 17 from Paola, two sisters aged 14 and 15 from Gżira, a 15-year-old from Valletta and 20-year-old Aicha Mariah from Paola – all pleaded not guilty.  Three of the girls were charged with aggravated theft while the 20-year-old was separately charged with unlawful possession of the penknife as well as relapsing.  The alleged victim was not only attacked but also robbed of his bag, containing some €90 in cash. The court upheld a request for bail by defence lawyers Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb, Adreana Zammit, Ishmael Psaila, Dustin Camilleri and Alexia Attard against a personal guarantee of €2,000 each, under a curfew between 10pm and 6am, signing the bail book once a week and under strict orders not to approach the victim in any manner.  The prosecution had objected to bail since the victim was still to testify and was still in hospital. But Magistrate Mifsud dismissed their request, stating that although the young offenders deserved a warning, they ought not to be remanded in custody but rather allowed to go back to their studies. In his appeal, attorney general lawyer Kenneth Camilleri said the first court had been “very lenient” with the accused, especially after having ignored the prosecution’s concerns about the strong possibility of tampering with evidence.  He asked the court to vary the conditions by, among others, imposing more onerous and effective financial deterrents as well as imposing a supervision order so the defendants would be followed closely.  A hearing has been set for Monday.  The victim told the police he was attacked by a group of six and identified one of the aggressors as a 14-year-old Maltese boy from Żurrieq.  Working on CCTV footage and information gathered through hours of intensive police work, investigators managed to identify the other five suspects who were tracked down and arrested.  Sources said the alleged victim was an ex-boyfriend of a friend of the co-accused and that there had been some verbal spat before the situation escalated to physical violence.

Title: Court throws out breach of rights claim by one of Europe's most wanted fugitives
Body: A court has thrown out a breach of rights claim by convicted explosives importer Jomic Calleja Maatouk, currently still one of Europe’s most wanted fugitives.  The man was handed a five-year effective term of imprisonment last July, in a judgment handed down by a Magistrates’ Court, describing him as a “lethal weapon” ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk appealed that decision and was out on bail pending final judgment. However, soon after, Calleja and his wife went missing. The couple were subsequently targeted by a European Arrest Warrant and placed on Europol’s list of most wanted fugitives.  While criminal proceedings against him were still pending before the Magistrates’ Courts, Calleja Maatouk had flagged a constitutional issue concerning the disclosure of information by the prosecution.  Police had pressed charges against him for allegedly importing explosives purchased on the dark web after obtaining intelligence pointing investigators in his direction.  When asked how that information had been obtained from the dark web, superintendent George Cremona had testified that “it was irrelevant”.  The presiding Magistrate agreed, pointing out that if that information was police intelligence, then the superintendent could not testify about it.  The accused’s lawyer asked for full disclosure, but the request was rejected.  A subsequent request for a constitutional reference was also turned down by the court in an “exhaustive and well reasoned” decree delivered by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech in March 2022 which concluded that the request was “frivolous and vexatious.”  That was when Calleja Maatouk filed separate constitutional proceedings claiming that the lack of full disclosure breached the accused’s fundamental rights.  The relative provision under the Criminal Court regulating disclosure did not provide “an independent mechanism”. Rather than have the court decide whether a particular piece of information was intelligence or otherwise, the matter was placed in the hands of the police and the Attorney General who were interested parties in the proceedings.  Calleja Maatouk’s lawyer referred to the more “just and fair” procedure adopted under the US and Dutch systems when compared to the system adopted under Maltese law, arguing that the latter was defective.  There were “blatant loopholes” which resulted in a breach of the accused’s fundamental rights, argued lawyer Benjamin Valenzia.  Such lack of full disclosure meant that Calleja Maatouk could not provide a valid defence.  When delivering judgment on Monday, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction observed that the issue which formed the subject matter of the case was “identical” to that which had been decreed upon by the Magistrates’ Court.  Yet, even though the Magistrate had concluded that the claim was “simply frivolous and vexatious”, Calleja Maatouk had proceeded with separate constitutional proceedings.  Citing case law on this matter, Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey concluded that the applicant’s claim was null, declaring that the court would not pronounce itself on a matter that had already been declared “frivolous and vexatious” by another court.

Title: One of three charged with Sliema double murder agrees to 40-year jail term
Body: One of three men awaiting trial for a double murder in Sliema is to plead guilty after agreeing to a 40-year jail sentence as part of a plea deal. Jesper Kristiansen is one of three men accused of murdering Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski inside their Sliema home in August 2020. Kristiansen, a Danish national, had fled Malta following the murder but was arrested 10 days later in Spain, after Spanish police tracked him down in Cadiz, and extradited him back to Malta to face criminal charges. The other two men facing murder charges in the case are Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national Viktor Dragomanski. Prosecutors opted to charge the three separately but on Monday informed the Criminal Court that the three had been put together under one joint bill of indictment.   That meant Kristiansen, Dragomanski and Muka were to stand trial together.  However, Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras took note of a joint note filed by the prosecution and Kristiansen's defence team, which noted that the parties had agreed on the terms of a plea bargain. The court was informed that Kristiansen would enter a guilty plea against the agreed punishment of 40 years and his share of court expenses.  The accused, assisted by lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto, confirmed that he understood the implications of that note.  AG lawyer Kevin Valletta then asked for the separation of proceedings, meaning that Dragomanski and Muka would part company with Kristiansen.  That request was upheld.  Kristiansen is expected to formally confirm his plea at another sitting in the near future.  Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison if found guilty. Once his plea deal is formalised, he will also be able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta is prosecuting. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto are counsel to Kristiansen. Lawyers Joe Giglio and Michaela Giglio are appearing parte civile.

Title: Iran sentences man to death over killing prominent filmmaker
Body: An Iranian court has sentenced a man to death over the killing of renowned filmmaker Dariush Mehrjui and his wife months ago at their home near Tehran, the judiciary said Monday. Mehrjui, an 83-year-old director associated with the Iranian new wave of cinema, was stabbed to death along with his wife Vahideh Mohammadifar in October at their home in Karaj, west of the Iranian capital. The convicted killer, who was arrested days after the attack, was a former employee of Mehrjui who “had a grudge against the deceased due to financial issues”, the chief justice of Alborz province, Hossein Fazeli-Harikandi, said previously. Three others were charged in the case over their roles in planning and assisting the murder, he added. On Monday, the Judiciary’s Mizan Online website said the court sentenced the killer to death in accordance with the Islamic law of retribution, known as the “qisas” law. He was found guilty of the “premeditated murder of Mehrjui and Mohammadifar”, Mizan quoted Fazeli-Harikandi as saying. He added that the application of the retribution law came at the request of Mehrjui’s family. The other defendants received sentences ranging from eight to 36 years in prison, according to Fazeli-Harikandi. The verdicts, however, are not final and can be appealed before the Supreme Court, Mizan added. Following Mehrjui’s death, tributes poured in to celebrate the works of the pioneer director, producer and screenwriter, who during his six-decade career was confronted by censorship both before and after the Islamic revolution of 1979. The director was best known for his 1969 metaphorical drama The Cow as well as his 1990 dark comedy Hamou” showing 24 hours in the life of an intellectual tormented by divorce and psychological anxieties.

Title: Malta and the mob: how the Italian mafia came to view Malta as a second home
Body: Antonio Ciavarello’s arrest in Mosta on a nondescript Thursday morning brought Malta’s role as the hideout of choice for mafia bosses and henchmen back into the spotlight. Ciavarello is the son-in-law of notorious Sicilian mafia boss Totó Riina, once the head of the Corleone clan immortalised by Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather trilogy.   But Ciavarello is only the latest in a long line of mobsters linked to Italian or Sicilian mafia clans found to be hiding in Malta over the years. Riina himself was known to be a frequent visitor to Gozo, often spotted in St Francis Square in Victoria. Like many others before him, Ciavarello successfully kept a low profile in Malta, avoiding run-ins with the police and dutifully reporting for his day job as a driver with a construction company. Some of his predecessors had gone to greater lengths to hide their identities. Sebastiano Brunno, the head of the Nardo clan of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, was arrested to great acclaim in 2014 after five years on the run. Brunno had been living under a false identity, going by the fanciful name of Natale La Modica, even producing a fake Italian ID card when approached by police moments before his arrest as he was on his way to lunch in a Buġibba restaurant. Seemingly unperturbed by the prospect of years behind bars, Brunno reportedly congratulated police as he was being handcuffed, telling them “well done, you found me”. He is currently serving a life sentence for the 1992 murder of a man called Nicolò Agnello.  Sebastiano Brunno, head of the Nardo clan of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, was arrested in Buġibba to great acclaim in 2014 after five years on the run.   Earlier in the same year, Aldo Gionta, a member of the Neapolitan Camorra, was caught by Italian police in Pozzallo as he attempted to board a ferry to Malta. Gionta was known to be somewhat of a maverick, often taking to wearing wigs and even cross-dressing in his attempts to evade authorities. Known as the “poet boss”, thanks to his penchant for penning poems while in lockup, Gionta was wanted by police for hiring his own brother to kill a man who had slapped his 14-year-old son, after the boy had thrown an egg at him during carnival celebrations. Simone Gaetano, believed to be a member of the Stidda mafia clan, was making the opposite ferry journey from Malta to Pozzallo in September 2019, only to find Sicilian police waiting patiently for him as he disembarked. Countless others, from Cosa Nostra mobster Giuseppe Arcaria to Francesca Rispoli, daughter of the notorious ’Ndrangheta boss Vincenzo Rispoli, were captured either while travelling to or hiding in Malta, or, in the case of the latter, after organising what police described as an extortion beating in Marsascala.  Stories in Times of Malta about Mafia links to the country.    Carlo Bonini, deputy editor-in-chief of La Repubblica, thinks that the mafiosi caught in Malta throughout the years are only the tip of the iceberg. “In reality, nobody really knows how many people are hiding in Malta,” he told Times of Malta. The mob’s presence in Malta’s criminal underworld is spread across several notorious mafia families, each having cornered a part of the market. According to DIA, Italy’s anti-mafia agency, Cosa Nostra is particularly active in the drug trade, with the ’Ndrangheta and Santapaolo-Ercolano families mostly opera­ting in gambling and betting circles. A major police operation in 2021, codenamed ‘Operation La Vallette’, uncovered how mob operators smuggled some 430kg of cannabis and cocaine from Puglia to Malta. With the help of their local contact, a man named John Spiteri, the drugs were hidden inside a fruit and vegetable shop in Attard. This came shortly after businessman Antonio Ricci was arrested in Malta for his alleged links to a €60m online gaming racket. He had been suspected of ties with the 'Ndrangheta mafia although his lawyers insist that his only pending issues in Italy relate to whether he should pay his taxes in Malta or Italy.   Online gambling and sports betting are proving to be increasingly fertile ground for the mafia in Malta. In 2021, Catania police found that several Maltese companies were being used by the Santapaola-Ercolano clan to evade some €30m in taxes from online bets. The question remains – what is it that makes Malta so attractive to the mafia? DIA, Italy’s anti-mafia agency, believe that it is a combination of several factors. First and foremost, Malta’s geographical proximity to Italy and Sicily, together with its EU membership, has meant that “in recent years the presence of Italian organised crime has increased” across the island. Secondly, Malta’s “particularly favourable tax regime” and its low corporate tax make it ideally placed for the mob’s money laundering activities.   DIA director Giuseppe Governale argues that it ultimately boils down to a simple equation: “The mafia has always had great vision, it has always carried out a cost-benefit analysis: in short, it goes where GDP grows and where anti-mafia legislation is reduced or less effective.” Malta, with its decade-long economic boom and historically lax approach to white-collar crime, fits Governale’s description like a glove. Carlo Bonini agrees. He says that it is an open secret that hundreds of Italian professionals use Malta to hide or launder their money, often by opening companies and benefitting from low taxes. “If regular people do it, why wouldn’t organised crime?”, he asks. Bonini also thinks that the types of industries that have thrived in Malta in recent years, from real estate to online gaming, are particularly susceptible to money laundering activities. Malta’s police force, Bonini adds, is often less equipped to track down mafia members on the run, compared to their Italian counterparts. “These people are used to hiding from dedicated anti-mafia agencies and police with specialised training in the field,” he told Times of Malta. Hiding from Maltese police, by comparison, is seen as more straightforward. But authorities say that coordination between Maltese and Italian law enforcement has been stepped up to tackle these criminals. In a LinkedIn post shortly after Ciavarello’s arrest, crimi­nologist and head of the Malta Gaming Authority’s financial crime compliance unit Antonio Abdilla Zerafa said that although the geographical proximity between Malta and Italy increases the chances of criminal gangs settling in Malta, the “sustained and effective collaboration bet­ween the law enforcement agencies of both nations has consistently facilitated the apprehension of high-profile criminal figures and the confiscation of illicit assets”.

Title: 'Feliċ will have two days of fame': Man tells friends he shared viral sex video
Body: A man accused of filming a fellow diner having sex with a woman at the Luqa boċċi club allegedly owned up to sharing the video without the couple’s consent but shrugged it off saying “Feliċ will have his two days of fame”.  Mark Cachia Zammit, a 35-year-old delivery man from Birżebbuġa, posted that comment in a Messenger group chat after a video of a sex scene, filmed during an evening meal, went viral on Facebook.  The whole episode landed Cachia Zammit in court  facing criminal charges as the prime suspect behind the filming and non-consensual sharing of the footage, with his table companions being summoned as eyewitnesses.  Cachia Zammit’s lawyers are claiming that he lacked criminal intent since he never meant to harm the alleged victims who had “tacitly consented” to the filming.  When the proceedings resumed this week, two of the accused’s friends who witnessed the unfolding of events that evening both appeared to agree that Feliċ “did what he did freely” and appeared to “enjoy the attention” of his table companions.  One of the witnesses recalled arriving last at the venue that September evening. He had been invited along by Cachia Zammit and when he got there, the rest of the group were already seated, waiting for dinner to be served.  Feliċ and the woman were sitting next to each other “chatting normally”. Grabbing a drink at the bar, he waited until starters were followed by the main course and then joined the others at the table, sitting at one end, facing the bar.  “Everybody was chatting in smaller groups at the table,” explained the witness, who said that he was on his mobile phone while eating. He suddenly heard shouting.  “Feliċ and the woman were dancing intimately with their clothes on... Feliċ was enjoying the attention he was getting,” as others at the table egged him on, he explained. The couple returned to their seats and but went back to their dancing, their movements “getting more and more intimate”.  “Feliċ appeared to be holding back while she egged him on, removing his clothes,” said the witness, stressing that at that moment he chose to focus on his food.  The woman led Feliċ towards a billiards table, that had been shifted to make space for their gathering, “and they had sex there” to shouts of “come on Feliċ! You’re king!”. The witness was not pleased with the unexpected turn of events.  “I went there to eat and ended up in all this. I had thought it would just be a meal, a drink and then back home. I have a girlfriend,” explained the witness, annoyed by the hassle that the meal with friends had landed him in.  Another eyewitness testified that the couple “seemed to know each other”. The woman - a stranger to the witness - had allegedly joined the party of male friends on their way into the club.  “They ended up entwined (gew kobba), hugging and kissing,” said the witness. And as the situation grew more intimate, so did the comments.  Asked who was behind those comments, the witness said that he “recognised the voice of Mark Cachia Zammit”.  Given the angle of filming of the video which ended up on social media, the witness claimed that the person filming must have been Cachia Zammit.  When the footage went viral the following morning, those present at the meal were shocked and confronted the accused about it, court heard. “All reached the same conclusion that he had filmed it,” said the witness. Later, the accused allegedly admitted his mistake in a group chat among friends, but shrugged it off saying: “Feliċ will have his two days of fame". During the sexual episode, the bar owner had ordered the couple to stop, telling them to “go outside or go to the bathroom”.  But when his orders were ignored multiple times, he closed the entrance to the club and went back to his cooking.  Questioned about the couple at the centre of attention, the witness said “Feliċ did what he did freely. No one forced him". Moreover, he seemed to be aware that he was being filmed because “he began to pose and wave, conscious of the filming”.  “What about the woman,” asked the prosecutor. “She too,” came the reply.  Cross-examined by defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, the witness confirmed that he too was holding his mobile phone at the time of the incident.  He was scrolling casually because, after a while, he lost interest in what was going on around him. “Were you on a video call?” pressed on Azzopardi.  “Yes, because someone called me and I answered. He [the caller] asked: ‘what’s all that noise?’ And I hung up.”  The case, presided over by Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia, continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Kurt Farrugia are prosecuting. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta are defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Teens plead guilty to breaking into their headmaster’s safe
Body: Three teens who admitted to breaking into a safe inside their headmaster’s office, stealing cash and two model cars, were granted bail pending sentencing by the juvenile court.  Their mischievous plan landed the 14-year-olds, a UK-born girl, a Polish boy and an Italian boy, in deep trouble and ultimately in court. On Friday afternoon, they pleaded guilty to the solitary charge of theft aggravated by means and value. The students were tracked down as the suspects who broke into the principal’s office at the middle school they attended and forced open a safe.  The suspected theft took place between February 2 and 5.  Although initially it was thought that some €8,000 was missing, the actual amount stolen was subsequently confirmed as falling between €3,000 and €5,000. Two model cars were also stolen.  Working on CCTV footage as well as information gathered from the school, police soon tracked down the suspected thieves. A magisterial search and arrest warrant was issued on Thursday and early on Friday morning police set about executing the arrests. By 7.30 am all three suspects were in police custody.  They were questioned separately, with each giving the same version of events.  They all collaborated and there was “no nonsense,” said prosecuting inspector Clayton Camilleri when giving an overview of the events leading to the arraignment.  It also resulted that the teens realised their mistake and had a change of heart, returning the items to their school, where they were subsequently spotted by a security guard. In court, the three students sat quietly, evidently nervous in the unfamiliar environment of the courtroom, with their parents and a social worker sitting closely behind them.  Assisted by their lawyers, the youngsters registered an admission which they confirmed after presiding Magistrate Joseph Gatt suspended the hearing for a while, giving them the chance to speak to the lawyers and reconsider their plea.  “Guilty,” all three repeated, each one in turn, when asked a second time by the magistrate.  “This was a very stupid mistake. Let’s admit that,” said the Magistrate, as all three nodded in agreement.  “Make sure you never come back here. You’re 14. You’ll sit for your exams soon…..You made a mistake, a serious one and hopefully the only one. Now [focus on ] books, books,” advised the Magistrate, his warning backed up by the defence team.  The prosecution and the defence filed a joint note explaining that in the circumstances a term of probation would be the appropriate punishment. The defence further requested a pre-sentencing report.  The court pointed out that despite their admission being registered at the earliest stage, the teens would have to be handed a sentence by another magistrate presiding over the juvenile court.  The current system of assignment of magisterial duties does not allow for a duty magistrate to deliver judgment in respect of minors, even if there is an admission. Defence lawyer and Chamber of Advocates president Peter Fenech, who was assisting one of the teens, pointed out that the system needed to change to cut down on “useless” dragged-out proceedings, especially in such cases where minors are involved.  The court then upheld a request for bail against a €200 deposit for each of the teens, promptly paid out by their parents in court.  The court also issued a ban on the names of the minors, the school as well as the headmaster who was present at the arraignment. The youngsters approached their school head right after the hearing and apologized for their misdeeds. AG lawyer Giuliana Magro Conti and inspectors Clayton Camilleri, Andrew Agius Bonello and Joseph Mallia prosecuted. Lawyers Peter Fenech and Elena Fenech, Noel Bianco and Sylvana Brannon assisted the teens respectively. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Woman spared 15-month jail term over wrong bail book location
Body: A woman has been spared 15 months in jail and indefinite detention over a separate case after a court found that the bail book she was convicted of failing to sign was at a different police station than the one mentioned in the charge sheet. Charlene Gatt, 37 from St Paul’s Bay, was convicted of having failed to sign the bail book as part of her bail conditions over a case in which she stood charged with allegedly hitting her female neighbour with a meat mallet. The court heard how she suddenly stopped signing the bail book between October 2021 and February 2022 when she was finally rearrested and charged with breach of bail. She was jailed for nine months and a six-month suspended sentence was brought into effect. The court had also ordered her detention until her case is decided as well as the revocation of a €5,000 bail bond. But presiding over her appeal, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera noted that the first court could have never found her guilty of failing to sign the bail book at the Żebbuġ police station because the bail decree presented in court by the prosecution stated that the bail book was at the police station in Paola. On the basis of this alone, the court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against Gatt. Moreover, the court observed that from testimonies of experts who knew Gatt, including a family doctor who had known her for at least 15 years, the woman had problems that would be better addressed outside jail. She was a single mother who was battling a drug addiction, among other problems. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera said that Gatt would be better off outside jail, where she can be followed closely by a probation officer and other experts who can help her get her life back on the right track. She therefore cleared her of the charges and overturned the effective jail term imposed by the first court. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Title: Another three men charged over Ħamrun brawl
Body: Three men, who allegedly triggered a massive brawl in Ħamrun earlier this week, were remanded in custody upon arraignment on Friday afternoon.  Ibrahim Flej, 33, Ismael Rajih, 32 and Kacem Al Flieg, 23, all sharing the same Qormi address, were escorted to court after being tracked down over their alleged involvement in the “big commotion” that broke out at around 1 pm on Tuesday.  Two Syrian brothers, Saoud and Naief Mahmoud, were arraigned on Thursday and were also denied bail.  Today, the court heard how last Tuesday, officers at the Ħamrun police station heard a lot of shouting outside.  They went out to check and saw many people rushing in one direction.  Heading in that direction, a short distance away from the station, the policemen came across a “large scale commotion,” with people locked in a scuffle.  Four men were arrested and escorted to the police station for questioning.  Two of them were subsequently released.  The other two, who bore visible signs of injury, were taken to the polyclinic, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa.  Footage from the scene of the brawl led to the identification of three other suspects, namely the trio arraigned on Friday.  They had arrived in Ħamrun in a van which they parked some way off from the site where the incident took place.  They stepped out of the vehicle and lingered nearby, apparently waiting. Then suddenly, all three dashed in the direction of the area where the fight broke out.  That footage did not capture the fight but at one point, Ibrahim returned to the van, drew out a piece of wood and headed back in the direction of the fight scene. That wooden object was the same one police seized when they stepped in to break up the fight, the prosecutor said.  The suspected trio were arrested and interrogated. On Friday they pleaded not guilty to slightly injuring Saoud, inciting a gathering of ten or more persons, actively participating in that crowd, speaking foul or indecent language in public and wilful breach of public peace.  The defence requested bail, arguing that these were summary charges carrying a punishment which did not exceed two years imprisonment.  The accused had untainted criminal records, a fixed address and jobs. Moreover, there was no risk of tampering with evidence since the alleged victims were currently in jail, under preventive custody, argued lawyer Frank Anthony Tabone.  The prosecution objected since the alleged victims and other eyewitnesses were still to testify.  Saoud was initially reluctant to tell police that he had suffered the blows.  The brawl appeared to have stemmed from some unresolved issue regarding payments related to work that the parties had undertaken.  Saoud did not even want to go to the polyclinic at first, but later explained that he had received the first blow on the head from Ibrahim. Parte civile lawyer Matthew Xuereb pointed out that there were civilian witnesses, including a veteran lawyer and Saoud’s partner, who were still to testify.  His clients had been charged when they were the victims, said the lawyer.  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Gatt, turned down the request for bail given the nature of the charges and the fact that civilians were still to testify.

Title: Maltese man to be extradited to US as prime suspect in FBI malware investigation
Body: Updated 1.35pm A Maltese man will be extradited to the US as part of an FBI investigation into the sale of illegal malware on the dark web. Daniel Joe Meli, 27, from Żabbar was also allegedly involved in mentoring services on a hacking forum, according to police. The malware is known as RAT - or remote access trojan - and is used by criminals to gain access to and control computers and servers. Several US victims have fallen prey to RAT, with no reported victims in Malta so far, the police added. A search and arrest warrant for Meli, a check-in agent, was issued by a magistrate on Tuesday. On Facebook, he says he works for Aviaserve and previously worked at Air Malta.  The investigations in Malta were led by the Cybercrime Unit following a request for assistance by the US authorities, which believe that the prime suspect in the sale of malware is Maltese. According to investigations by the local police, Meli was working with other people who were not Maltese and did not live here. He was arrested at his place of work in Gudja on February 7. Several items linked to the investigation were confiscated from places owned by the suspect. He was escorted to court, where Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday kicked off the extradition procedure. Meli consented to the extradition and is being kept at the Corradino Correctional Facility in the meantime. His lawyer, Joe Giglio, invoked the rule of speciality, meaning that he was to be extradited to answer only for the charges indicated in the relative documentation.  A Nigerian accomplice was arrested in Nigeria, while investigations led by Europol are ongoing in Austria, Canada, Croatia, Finland, The Netherlands, Romania, Germany and Nigeria. Inspectors Dr Mario Cuschieri and Robinson Mifsud prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Man admits to sexual harassment at workplace
Body: A man pleaded guilty to sexually harassing a co-worker by touching her breast, later sending her an apology through Facebook Messenger. Ernest Assumang Kumi, a 47-year-old Nigerian national living in Birżebuġa, was targeted by criminal action for committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature and following a course of conduct which amounted to harassment.  Prosecuting Inspector Wayne Bonello said the incident took place last November at the company’s Qormi offices. The victim filed a report a few weeks later in December. The woman told police that on the day of the harassment, the accused approached her to speak to her about his plans to move abroad, asking about his wages.  While the woman was talking to him, discussing his payslip, he suddenly touched her breast, saying: “I can’t stay away from your breast”. The woman pushed him away, shielding herself against the unwelcome advances while the man passed some further indecent comments. She told him to go away and he did.  Later, he sent her a Facebook message apologising for his behaviour. An arrest warrant was issued against the suspect but it could not be executed since he was abroad.  He was arrested on Wednesday as soon as he returned to Malta, explained the prosecutor.  Assisted by a legal aid lawyer, the man registered an admission. Asked by presiding magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil whether he fully understood the charges, the accused said: “It was a mistake. I touched her breast. But we talk to each other all the time.”  Given more time to consult his lawyer and reconsider his plea, the accused confirmed his admission.  Parte civile lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin said that on Wednesday the accused had filed a report against the victim alleging “some sort of touching from the back”.  However, in light of his admission on Thursday, the defence said that that report was to be withdrawn by the accused.  The parties agreed that a maximum term of probation, coupled with a protection order, would be appropriate punishment in the circumstances.  The victim would be spared re-living the incident and would not be called to testify, explained her lawyers.  Moreover, the accused had filed an early guilty plea, had cooperated with the police and apologised for his wrongdoing.  The court put off the case for judgment on Monday and upheld the defence’s request for bail against a deposit of €500, a personal guarantee of €1,000, signing the bail book daily until Monday and not approaching the victim or other witnesses in any manner.  The court also issued a ban on the victim’s name and issued a protection order in her regard, warning the accused of the consequences if he were to breach that order.  AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli and Inspector Wayne Bonello prosecuted.  Lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant was legal aid counsel. Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin appeared parte civile.

Title: German libraries up defences against far-right attack
Body: Defaced and destroyed, books torn up and political messages scrawled across their pages: the evidence of an alleged far-right vandalism spree at a city library in Berlin covers an entire table. “The first reaction was confusion, then outrage, when we realised what had happened here,” Boryano Rickum, chief librarian for Tempelhof-Schoeneberg district, told AFP.  The incident – the work of a single suspect – was not, however, a one-off.  The library at Berlin’s Technical University is also thought to have been targeted by far-right vandalism, while elsewhere extremists have crashed events and threatened staff.   The cases illustrate what campaigners call a “cultural struggle” as extremist ideas gain purchase and the far-right climbs in the polls. The increased threat has prompted efforts to better arm public spaces against attack and protect them as a space for dialogue. Staff at the library in well-heeled Tempelhof-Schoenberg were used to finding the odd scribbled swastika but the vandalism crossed a line, said Rickum. Destroying books was, in his eyes, tantamount to an “attack on democracy”.  “The moment we discovered the damage, it was clear that we couldn’t just go back to business-as-usual.” Critical censorship The topics dealt with in the books gave some indication of the possible motivation: the history of feminism, critical analyses of far-right groups and the autobiographies of prominent green politicians. “We had to assume that it was an attempt to prevent a critical discussion of right-wing extremism and National Socialism,” said Rickum.  Acts of violence against books have a particular resonance in Germany, where the Nazis, who ruled up to 1945, ceremonially burnt publications they deemed to be subversive or deviant.   The acts of radical censorship are commemorated in central Berlin on Bebelplatz, the site of such a bonfire in the 1930s. In recent times, many cultural institutions have had run-ins with extremists, said Bianca Klose from MBR, an advisory group, which offers help dealing with the far-right.  “But now we’ve noticed that in particular public libraries are increasingly noticing a so-called cultural struggle from the right,” said Klose. By targeting libraries, “the extremist right is trying to change the boundaries of what can be said”, according to Klose, whose organisation printed a pamphlet with advice for librarians last year.   The publication details confrontations with the far right, such as threats made last year against a reading to children by two drag queens at a Munich library. With a growing number of elected officials, the far-right AfD party was “trying to use political power to gain influence over libraries”, Klose said. The party’s representatives used their positions to ask “why certain books are not in collections”, notably ones from right-wing publishing houses, sometimes framed as a matter of political neutrality. ‘The right place’ The pamphlet offers best-practice solutions: how to establish guidelines, how to decide what books to stock and ways to contextualise content in libraries. In Tempelhof-Schoeneberg, the library’s response has been to “put the focus on the books affected”, said Rickum.  Many of the authors of the vandalised books have been invited to discuss their ideas and the staff has established a reading group around the issue.    Federico Quadrelli, 37, a volunteer who leads the group, sees it as “a space where people can meet and talk about important, current, political topics”. The suspected vandal at the Tempelhof-Schoeneberg library, a man in his early thirties from Berlin, has been charged with damaging property. The aim of the attack was to limit debate, said Rickum. “We want to achieve the opposite, namely that people assess it critically.” “Democracy needs a place where people can come together... and we think this is the right place,” he said. “Of course, I also know that as a library we cannot do this alone. We need civil society to save democracy.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Son-in-law of mafia boss Totò Riina arrested in Malta
Body: Updated 4.01pm The son-in-law of late Sicilian mafia boss Totò Riina has been arrested in Malta and has consented to his extradition to Italy. Antonino Ciavarello was arrested in Mosta early on Thursday morning, a day after his 50th birthday, on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued in Italy. The police said in a statement the Italian authorities issued the warrant on January 24, 2022.  The 50-year-old is wanted by the Brindisi Public Prosecutor's Office to serve a prison sentence after having been convicted of fraud and breach of police bail. Ciavarallo is married to the daughter of Salvatore “Totò” Riina, a notorious Sicilian mafia boss, who led the Corleonesi clan immortalised in the Godfather films. Nicknamed the 'beast' because of his cruelty and known as 'the boss of bosses' of the mafia, he targeted his crimial rivals in the 1980s and 90s as well as journalists, prosecutors and judges who got in his way.  One of Italy's most feared mobsters, he died in a prison hospital bed in 2017 while serving 26 life sentences and was believed to have ordered the killing of more than 150 men. His most famous victim was Giovanni Falcone, an anti-mafia judge murdered in a car bomb in 1992.    Palermo-born Ciavarello was taken to court on Thursday afternoon and immediately consented to his extradition. Assisted by an interpreter and seated throughout the hearing after complaining of leg pains, he said that he worked as a driver with a local company. His legal aid lawyer explained that the accused was aware of the sentences in his regard but did not know that they were effective. He never had any issues with police or authorities in Malta and had only once landed a fine. Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil confirmed with the prosecution that the man had no pending judicial proceedings in Malta and upon his consent, remitted him into custody pending his extradition. Prosecuting inspector Roderick Spiteri presented documentation including correspondence with Italian counterparts confirming that the wanted man’s fingerprints matched those of the person arrested today. The forensic laboratory had tested Ciavarello's fingerprints after his arrest. Lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant was legal aid counsel.

Title: EU agrees first law on combatting violence against women
Body: EU member countries and lawmakers reached an agreement on Tuesday on the bloc's first rules to tackle violence against women, the European Parliament and officials said. The law seeks to protect women in the 27-nation European Union from gender-based violence, forced marriages, female genital mutilation and online harassment. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, first proposed the major legislation on March 8, 2022, to mark International Women's Day. "It's a clear message across the union that we take violence against women seriously," EU lawmaker Frances Fitzgerald told reporters in Strasbourg after the announcement. "It is a directive that the women and girls all across the European Union have asked for for over 30 years," another lawmaker, Evin Incir of Sweden, said. "For the first time ever, we criminalise widespread forms of cyberviolence, such as non-consensual sharing of intimate images," Vera Jourova, European Commission vice president for values and transparency, said on social media. The text criminalises cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyber incitement to hatred or violence across the European Union. It does not, however, include a common definition of rape, which proved to be the most controversial point in negotiations. "We could not get consent-based definition of rape into this directive. So that is a very big disappointment," Fitzgerald said. Although the text does not contain a definition of rape, member states will aim to raise awareness that non-consensual sex is considered a criminal offence, the parliament said in a statement. The commission will have to report every five years on whether the rules need to be updated, it added. The parliament and at least a dozen EU countries including Belgium, Greece and Italy had wanted to include a definition of rape. But a dozen other countries, including France, Germany and Hungary, opposed doing so, arguing the EU had no competence in the matter. The states in opposition argued that rape does not have the cross-border dimension, necessary for it to be considered a crime that comes with common penalties in the bloc. The parliament and the commission strongly disputed that position, insisting that rape could fall within the framework of "sexual exploitation of women", for which there is already a joint set of penalties.  The reluctance to agree a definition of rape sparked controversy in France, where President Emmanuel Macron had said tackling violence against women would be a priority of his second term. Macron had already elicited criticism after defending the presumption of innocence for Gerard Depardieu, who has been charged with rape and sexual harassment.

Title: Men caught red handed by police in foiled armed hold-up denied bail
Body: Two armed robbers, allegedly caught in the act by policemen patrolling St Paul’s Bay streets in the early hours of Monday morning, were remanded in custody upon arraignment.  Mitchel Buhagiar, a 33-year-old sales manager, and Konrad Cassar, a 47-year-old water leaks technician, both from St Paul’s Bay, were caught red-handed while allegedly attempting to rob a supermarket store in Triq il-Maskli at around 3 am.  Three police officers patrolling the area were alerted by the commotion which led them to the store where they spotted two masked and armed men holding up the female cashier and a male shop worker, prosecuting Inspector Clayton Camilleri explained. One of the men carried a knife while the other had a screwdriver-like instrument which later turned out to be a sharpening tool.  When foiled, one of the suspects immediately cooperated and lay face down on the floor. But his partner in crime tried to escape, heading to the toilets and stores at the back of the supermarket where he was subsequently arrested.  The pair were jointly charged with attempted aggravated theft, unlawfully holding the two victims against their will, causing them to fear violence, as well as wilfully breaching the public peace.  Both were also charged with relapsing.  Buhagiar was separately charged with slightly injuring the male shop worker by putting the knife to his back, failing to obey legitimate police orders, wilful damage to third-party property as well as breaching bail.  They pleaded not guilty.  Assisted by legal aid lawyers, both accused requested bail.  Buhagiar had a fixed job and there was no fear of absconding. He has a drug problem and wished to start a rehabilitation programme, lawyer Alexia Vassallo argued. Cassar was also a drug addict who wished to reform himself. He had a fixed address and job and the convictions on his conduct sheet related to offences dating back ten years. The request was objected to by the prosecution in both cases.  The accused were caught red-handed and were armed while carrying out a crime against the person. Both men were untrustworthy and their criminal record offered no peace of mind, AG lawyer Claire Sammut countered.  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request. Buhagiar had already been afforded an opportunity when granted bail in separate proceedings, observed the court. Moreover the fear of tampering with evidence, the need to protect third parties and serious doubts as to the accused’s trustworthiness led the court to deny bail.  As for Cassar, the court observed that the accused was masked when attempting the hold-up, thus indicating that the crime was planned and that the accused tried to hide away from justice.  Although he cooperated when arrested, there were eyewitnesses who still had to testify.  The court also issued a Protection Order in respect of the alleged victims, including the two workers and shop owners.  AG lawyer Claire Sammut and Inspector Clayton Camilleri prosecuted.

Title: PL MEP candidate asks police to investigate man over Muscat, Abela 'hate speech'
Body: Updated 3pm with Robert Aquilina comment A Labour MEP candidate has asked the police to investigate a man who insulted Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela on Facebook for hate speech. Daniel Attard filed a police report on Tuesday morning, arguing that Godfrey Leone Ganado had breached Article 82A of the Criminal Code in two comments he published online on Monday. Leone Ganado wrote of Muscat and Abela that he hoped “the unexplained wealth they accumulated off our backs will crumble to dust and bury them together with their families in a pit of smelly shit”.  In a subsequent comment, he added: “When dealing with this trash you need to call a spade a spade, and after all, you need a spade to lift shit”. Leone Ganado posted those comments beneath a post published by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina. Aquilina said he dissociated himself and Repubblika from the comments and Leone Ganado, and that he had deleted the comments as soon as he became aware of them.  The comments drew criticism from various quarters on social media, and on Tuesday morning Attard said he wanted Leone Ganado, whom he described as “part of the extremist Repubblika clique”, prosecuted. “I will insist on action being taken against anyone who thinks they are above the law, and to ensure justice is equal for all,” Attard said following his criminal report.   Leone Ganado is no stranger to controversy: in 2020 he lost a libel suit after he likened MP Rosianne Cutajar to a prostitute. “Hamalli, prostitutes and call girls have a right to be represented in parliament,” he wrote of the Qormi MP. A magistrate ruled that the comment impinged on Cutajar’s reputation and ordered Leone Ganado to pay her €800 in damages. Repubblika president Robert Aquilina clarified on Tuesday afternoon that Leone Ganado was not a member of Repubblika. He quit the association after  being threatened with expulsion when he made similar comments in the past, Aquilina said.

Title: Perfume thieves get a conditional discharge
Body: Two men have been conditionally discharged after admitting to stealing almost €300 worth of perfumes from a pharmacy in St Julian’s last month. Marius Fanel Galan, 36, staying at St Julian’s, and 40-year-old driver George Bigu, from Swieqi, were arrested after being tracked down as the suspects behind the theft that allegedly took place on January 26, some time between 5:00pm and 8:30pm. Galan said that he had been on holiday in Malta for a week. The pair were jointly charged with stealing perfumes and other items from the pharmacy.  The theft was aggravated by the value of the items stolen and the time when the incident took place. They registered an admission when they were arraigned on Monday and confirmed their guilty plea after the court granted them time to reconsider, warning that the charge carried a possible jail term.  When making submissions on punishment their lawyer, Franco Debono, highlighted the accused’s clean criminal record, the fact that they had cooperated with police and had apologized for their wrongdoing. Moreover, they registered an early guilty plea and were willing to reimburse the pharmacy owner for the €295 worth of perfumes and other items stolen. The circumstances of the case did not even merit a suspended sentence, argued the lawyer. However prosecuting Inspector Jonathan Ransley called for a suspended sentence, pointing out that one of the accused said that he came to Malta as a tourist but ended up stealing. After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, declared the two men guilty upon their own admission and conditionally discharged them for two years. AG lawyer Andreas Vella and Inspector Jonathan Ransley prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.

Title: Man pleads guilty to series of thefts from Malta, Gozo
Body: A man pleaded guilty to a series of thefts from November through to January from different localities in Malta and Gozo. The police said in a statement the man - a 30-year-old from Cape Verde who lives in Msida - was charged in Gozo on Saturday. Police investigations identified the man as the person responsible for thefts from a lotto office in Msida in November and January. He was also charged with attempted theft from a fuel station and an office in the same locality in January.  In December, he stole from an Iklin lotto office and a petrol station in Xewkija. In January he was also behind a theft from a hardware store in Xewkija.  The man was also charged with damaging third-party property and for being in possession of stolen goods. He was charged in front of Magistrate Simone Grech and will be sentenced later this month.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Paschalino Cefai charged over cocaine find after trying to flee police
Body: Paschalino Cefai, notorious for a string of crimes in Gozo, has been charged with aggravated possession of cocaine and with trying to flee the police. The court heard on Saturday how the 44-year-old from Zebbuġ, Gozo was stopped in a car where he was a passenger on January 25 in Marsa. The car, which had heavily tinted windows, had an expired road licence and insurance. The woman was asked to step out of the car but Cefai remained seated in the passenger seat. While the police spoke to the woman driver, Cefai sneaked out of the car, ran to the driver's side and tried to drive off. He was promptly stopped in the act. When the police searched the car, they found 14 grams of cocaine inside a bag in a jacket on the car’s back seat. Cefai appeared before Magistrate Leonard Caruana charged with possession of cocaine found in circumstances denoting it was not for personal use as well as with trying to flee from the scene, resisting the police and disobeying their orders. He was further charged with relapsing and with breaching the conditions of a previous release since he was out on bail over other crimes. He was accused of breaching the bail conditions imposed in April 2022, in a case in which he stands charged with his involvement in an alleged hold-up in Naxxar with two accomplices. Defence lawyers asked Magistrate Caruana to release their client on bail, arguing that the alleged incident was caught on the police bodycams so the evidence was preserved. However, police inspector Mark Cremona countered that there were civilian witnesses who still had to testify in the case. The court turned down the request since Cefai did not offer the guarantees that he would respect bail conditions is released. He was remanded in custody.  Lawyers Charles Mercieca, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. Cefai is synonymous with various crimes in Gozo, and was once described by a judge as a person who “terrorised Gozo” with his constant aggressive attitude. In 2012, he stabbed a man inside a courtroom and was given a seven-year jail sentence. He was back in court in August last year, after he seriously injured a man who tried to rob him. In that case, the court heard how a robber entered the residence of the notorious Gozitan criminal but ended up leaving empty-handed and with serious facial injuries when the two got into a fight.

Title: 14 arrested in Europol-coordinated operation against Nigerian organised crime
Body: The police arrested 14 people in a joint operation coordinated by Europol targeting high-risk criminal networks in Nigerian organised crime. The operation took place seven weeks ago, between December 7 and 9 last year, but was only communicated to the media on Friday.  Police officers made the arrests following inspections in Marsa, Ħamrun and St Julians with the Customs Department, Detention Services and Environmental Health authorities.   The 14 people were arrested over illegal migration suspicions while three owners of African food shops will be arraigned in court over breaches of public health regulations. The authorities seized several documents, prohibited food and items related to drug use. Countries that participated in the operation included Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Iceland, Colombia, Nigeria and the Republic of Benin. International organisations included Europol, Interpol, Frontex, UNODC, CrimJust, UK Home Office International Operation in Nigeria and @ON Network. Various police sections, including the vice squad, the Rapid Intervention Unit, the K9 section and district police, were involved in the joint operation.

Title: Reform to shorten criminal court cases to begin ‘in months' - Justice Ministry
Body: The legislative process to shorten lengthy court proceedings will be kickstarted “in the coming months”, a Justice Ministry spokesperson has said after the family of a murder victim said the slow court system was adding to their pain. In an interview with Times of Malta, Daria Dembska said her family “cannot start mourning” until the man accused of murdering her sister Paulina in January 2022 is judged. Last year, a government White Paper proposed that the compilation of evidence stage should be concluded within one year from an arraignment. It also sought to eliminate the process called ‘referral’ (rinviju) that often lengthens the compilation as court documents bounce between the court and the attorney general’s office. This is no longer needed as it is now mandatory for AG representatives to be present in court. A Justice Ministry spokesperson said the consultation stage for the reform, which has been discussed for years, has been concluded. “We received numerous suggestions and proposals, which resulted in a very valid and informative consultation. There have been proposals that built on the consultation document, as well as broadened the scope of the reform. Thus, we had to amend and strengthen the draft bill, as well as consult with key stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the reform,” the spokesperson said. “It is our intention that in the coming months we kickstart the legislative process in parliament,” she added. Malta had emulated the British legal system in 1814 by laying down the need for a compilation of evidence to take place before a criminal trial. Britain has since removed this requirement to speed up the legal process, but Malta retains it. It means that before a trial can begin, the compilation of evidence process must take place.   Paulina Dembska, a 29-year-old Polish student was raped and strangled in the heart of Sliema on January 2, 2022. Abner Aquilina was arrested for the murder, charged, and the compilation of evidence process began. Two years later, it is still ongoing. A parallel has been drawn with the unprovoked murder of Ashling Murphy that happened in Ireland a few days after Dembska’s. When Roberta Metsola became European Parliament president that month, she paid tribute to both murdered women. But in the case of the 23-year-old Irish woman, the case has been concluded. Murphy, a 23-year-old teacher and musician, was murdered as she jogged along a canal near Tullamore, County Offaly, on January 12. Jozef Puska, 33, was charged with murder later that month. The trial began in October 2023, and three weeks later, he was jailed for life. Unlike the Irish justice system, a person charged in a Maltese court first has to go through the compilation of evidence in front of the Magistrates’ Court before the trial by jury can start in the presence of a panel of jurors and a judge. During the compilation, the police bring forward their witnesses as do the defence before the magistrate decides if there is a case against that person to go to trial. Franco Debono, a lawyer who specialises in criminal law, said that he agreed with reforming the compilation of evidence, noting that he had suggested doing that in a 2011 holistic justice reform private members bill when he was a Nationalist MP. However, he disagreed with removing it completely in any court case. He explained that the compilation of evidence served, among others, as a discovery stage – to build the picture of events, which is not always clear-cut and draw up the bill of indictment. Removing it entirely could mean that the full picture of events could not emerge, possibly leading to miscarriages of justice, Debono argued.  “Just because another country removed it, it does not mean they have a better system. I have always believed that a lazy justice system is not good, but one that is too hasty is even worse,” he said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Today's front pages – January 26, 2024
Body: The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Friday. Times of Malta leads with a call by the Gozo Tourism Association to extend the ban on demolition and excavation in summer to the entire island, insisting that the whole of Gozo is considered to be a tourist zone. The newspaper reports prominently on Thursday’s compilation of evidence against a man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend in Sliema that has been delayed after the defence challenged Malta's new femicide law. Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada denies the aggravated crime of femicide, which was introduced in the Criminal Code in 2022, and makes him liable to a harsher punishment. The Malta Independent and L-orizzont also report on the murder court case that was due to begin on Thursday but was deferred until next month. In-Nazzjon and The Malta Independent also report how patients at Mater Dei Hospital were being forced into “undignified” situations as they waited for beds to free up. Adrian Delia, the shadow minister for health, spoke on Thursday about persistent issues with long waiting lists at the country’s main hospital and warned that a staff shortage and staff burnout were close to leading Malta’s healthcare into a “critical emergency”. In-Nazzjon separately reports how certain factions within the Labour Party were pushing the idea for former leader Joseph Muscat to return to politics. L-orizzont meanwhile leads with comments by Foreign Minister Ian Borg that the “illegal” war of Russia in Ukraine topped Malta’s agenda as chair of the OSCE. The newspaper also reports on a case of a man who was a victim of domestic violence at home. He claims his wife threatened him with a gun.

Title: Man stopped by police over brake lights, charged with drug possession
Body: A driver, flagged down by community police over malfunctioning brake lights, ended up in greater trouble when officers sensed a "strong smell of cannabis" coming from the vehicle.  Omar Alhamdoalgorsh, a 26-year-old Syrian gypsum worker from Buġibba, was escorted to court on Thursday after being arrested two days ago.  Court was told that on Tuesday, community police patrolling the St Paul's Bay area spotted a vehicle with malfunctioning rear brake lights. They flagged down the driver and when they approached the vehicle they smelt "a strong scent of cannabis", prosecuting inspector Francesco Mizzi told court on Thursday.  A search of the vehicle yielded two sachets of cannabis on the dashboard. The officers found another bag of cannabis and a sachet containing eight ecstasy pills.  The driver was escorted to the Qawra police station, given his legal rights and told the reason for the arrest.  Asked by defence lawyer Noel Bianco, the prosecutor said that the accused had cooperated all along.  The man's family lived in Malta and he had a stable job, argued the lawyer when pushing for bail.  Moreover, he had cooperated fully, telling police how he acquired the drug.  As for the amounts, the accused had bought the drugs to share with a friend who was on holiday in Malta and staying at a hotel, pointed out the prosecutor, objecting to the request for bail.  The defence countered that the accused had admitted to police that he needed help to quit drugs and even cried under interrogation.  After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, upheld the request under various conditions, including a treatment order.  The accused would be monitored by a probation officer who was to report to court every two months.  "One negative report will spell repercussions," warned the magistrate.  The accused was to pay a deposit of €500, bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000, sign the bail book twice weekly and be home between 10pm and 6am. Inspector Francesco Mizzi prosecuted.

Title: Life sentences should be removed from Malta's laws - Chamber of Advocates
Body: The Chamber of Advocates said on Wednesday that it agreed in principle with a reform of the drug laws proposed by the government in a white paper. It said, however, that it is of the view that the concept of a life sentence for those convicted of trafficking illegal substances should no longer have a place in the laws. "The time has come for the parties represented in parliament to acknowledge that this punishment is draconian, it no longer exists in democratic countries and it should be removed from the criminal code in Malta," the chamber said. It said it agreed with the proposal that people accused of trafficking could choose between being tried by jury or by judges. But it felt that illicit substances should be divided into two categories according to their nature.  RELATED STORIES  As for the amount of drugs that would qualify an accused person to be arraigned before the Rehabilitation Board, the Chamber said that there should be a benchmark but not a fixed amount so as to avoid injustices owing to the rigidity of the numbers proposed.

Title: Man cleared of conspiring to burn car of ex’s new boyfriend
Body: A man accused of conspiring to burn a BMW vehicle driven by his ex-partner’s new boyfriend has been cleared based on lack of sufficient evidence.  Luke Vella, a 28-year-old Żabbar resident, was charged with conspiracy to commit arson, causing third parties to fear violence as well as breaching three previous sets of bail conditions.  Criminal investigations date to 2020 when Vella’s suspected accomplice headed to the Żabbar police station to spill the beans on the accused who had allegedly been trying to rope him into his plan to set fire to a particular vehicle. Gordon Albani, the alleged accomplice, detailed the alleged plot.  Vella was to call for him, drive him to his house to collect certain items, and then drop him off at the spot where the arson was to be committed.  But although he heard Vella’s plans and went along with him, he never meant to carry out the task, Albani later told police.  Instead of committing the arson, he headed to the police station to file a report.  Vella was subsequently charged, pleading not guilty. The court heard that the accused had been in a relationship with a woman and the couple also had a young child.  After they broke up, the woman started a relationship with someone else.  Her new boyfriend drove a BMW model that was registered in his father’s name.  That was the vehicle allegedly targeted in the planned arson.  Vella’s ex testified in the proceedings that Albani used to turn up at her takeaway outlet at  Żabbar, asking for money and food.  The guy had also told her about how her ex, Vella, had allegedly spoken to him several times to burn down her new boyfriend’s car. Albani claimed that Vella had promised him €700 for the job which was allegedly planned for the night of October 12, 2020.  That information had prompted the woman and her boyfriend to file a police report.  Vella denied any such agreement with Albani.  The prosecution produced mobile localisation and call profile data to prove that Vella and Albani were well acquainted and communicated frequently. That data - covering the period between June and October - showed that Vella called Albani 20 times on eight different days.  Between October 6 and 13, they communicated 12 times. Calls were localised around Żabbar, Żejtun, Birżebbuġa and Vittoriosa.  Although the pattern and frequency of those calls appeared to coincide with the prosecution’s theory, the content of the calls was unknown.  The very first element of the crime of conspiracy is the existence of an agreement between two or more people.  In this case, evidence showed that even if Vella was trying to convince Albani to go along with his plan, Albani never accepted, not even momentarily, to commit the arson.  Failure to prove that first element meant that the prosecution failed to prove the charge of conspiracy, said presiding Magistrate Leonard Caruana.  When testifying, Vella’s ex as well as her new boyfriend and his father, never expressed any sign of fear.  After Albani spoke to her about Vella’s arson plan, the woman was not convinced that the crime would take place.  Albani had also told her about some court proceedings involving him and Vella and said that he wanted to take revenge against her ex after landing a conviction.  There was no evidence of any fire having been started.  When all was considered, the court concluded that those offences were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and consequently Vella could not be found guilty of breaching those three bail decrees. The court thus pronounced an acquittal.  Lawyer Roberto Montalto was defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Andrea Prudente libel case continues in court
Body: US doctors told Andrea Prudente it was "not an issue" when she consulted them after experiencing some spotting for 15 days before she was due to travel from Seattle to Malta, a court heard on Monday.  Prudente’s case hit international headlines when she was denied an abortion in Malta after suffering a ruptured membrane while 16 weeks pregnant. Doctors told her they could only intervene if her life was at imminent risk. Her pregnancy was medically terminated in Spain. On Monday court heard that before travelling to Malta for her babymoon, Prudente had been told spotting was not an issue. That information was divulged in libel proceedings instituted by Prudente’s lawyer, Lara Dimitrijevic, on her behalf against former Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi over claims that the American tourist had conspired to introduce abortion in the country.  Another libel case was instituted against academic and blogger Simon Mercieca over a similar story he uploaded on his blog about the expectant mother who experienced symptoms of miscarriage during her trip to Malta in June 2022.  In a separate, constitutional case, Prudente is claiming that her fundamental rights were breached when doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy after her waters broke at 16 weeks. The suit against Azzopardi concerns a Facebook post in which the former MP claimed that Prudente came to Malta purposely to stir controversy over the termination of her pregnancy.  When the case resumed on Monday, Yves Muscat Baron, consultant head of the maternity and gynaecology department at Mater Dei Hospital, testified that he had never spoken to or examined Prudente but had checked her medical file after her gynaecologist consulted him about the case.  The woman was 16 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to Mater Dei Hospital after her waters ruptured.  Prudente later explained that she had been spotting for some 15 days before setting out on her trip to Malta with her partner, Jay Weeldreyer for their babymoon.  When testifying in separate breach of rights proceedings against the State, Prudente said that before travelling, she had consulted her health care providers who told her that such spotting was probably normal after intercourse, said Muscat Baron.  “But that [spotting] could also indicate detachment of the placenta… So we tell them [patients] to rest, not travel half across the world.”  Prudente travelled from Seattle to London and onto Malta, then crossed over to Gozo. She consulted doctors at Gozo General Hospital after experiencing more spotting but the foetal heartbeat and waters were all in place.   RELATED STORIES  The couple then visited a consultant at a private hospital who confirmed that there were blood clots behind the placenta.  Two days later, the patient’s waters ruptured and the consultant, Alberto Vella, referred her to Mater Dei Hospital where she was monitored for seven days.  During that period, Prudente had contacted gynecologist Isabelle Stabile who, in turn, called Vella saying, “you know what to do”.  That call was rather unusual and appeared to carry a “sort of threat”, prompting Vella to consult Muscat Baron who summoned a consultancy conference to discuss Prudente’s case with three other specialists.  Asked by Azzopardi’s lawyer, the witness said that Prudente was never in danger of dying.  That was the line of discussion among the consultants.  Asked by presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello whether the baby could survive at the point when Prudente went to Gozo, Muscat Baron replied, “yes”.  “Prudente herself was not at all in danger of dying,” went on the witness, when questioned by Prudente’s lawyer, Andrew Sciberras.  The patient was given intravenous antibiotics for a urinary tract infection she had at the time, reducing the risk of that infection being transmitted to the baby.  When waters rupture, there is a 1% risk of uterine infection too.  But when pressed further about the detached placenta, Muscat Baron explained that although there were blood clots behind the placenta, an unborn child can survive even when the surface area of the placenta is only 25% attached.  “It’s not a death sentence for the baby," he said. In Prudente’s case, the placenta was protruding, pointed out the lawyer.  But the consultant rebutted that if that were the case, the baby would not live. When Prudente was admitted to Mater Dei Hospital, an ultrasound showed that there was no liquid around the baby and there was prolapse of the umbilical cord. However after the mother rested in hospital, the cord moved back up.  “Had it remained outside [the mother’s body] it would have dried up and died.” “How did you conclude that Prudente did not rest,” asked Sciberras.  The expectant mother had travelled from Seattle to London and then to Malta and Gozo, Muscat Baron replied. “So are you saying that a pregnant woman cannot travel,” asked Sciberras. There was a difference when a pregnant mother was bleeding. “It’s only logical,” remarked Muscat Baron, drawing parallels with a “worse case” where a woman’s waters ruptured at 13 weeks.  In that case, he said, the baby had survived.  “Was it medically identical,” asked the lawyer.  “It was even worse at 13 weeks," Muscat Baron replied. The majority of those in the maternity department were of the view that it was not recommended for Prudente to travel, he added. “This is not my opinion. The majority of people within our department all say the same: It’s an accepted medical opinion”.  Asked whether he knew of any ulterior motive for Prudente to travel to Malta, the consultant replied, “she was on a babymoon”.  Prudente’s medical file was presented in evidence by a Mater Dei representative.  The case continues.  Lawyers Lara Dimitrijevic and Andrew Sciberras are representing Prudente.

Title: Court delays hamper FIAU's fight against money laundering: report
Body: Efforts by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit to effectively police the banking sector are being “greatly undermined” by delays in court proceedings, according to a national money-laundering risk assessment report. The anti-money laundering unit has faced an avalanche of appeals against the penalties it issues for anti-money laundering breaches. Both the size of such penalties and the FIAU’s ability to even issue fines have been successfully challenged in court. The report – led by a committee that includes the police and FIAU – hits out at the fact that a number of appeals against the size of the fines have been pending for more than the six months set out by law. It also questions whether the members of the judiciary hearing these appeals have the necessary know-how to do so.  "Appeals to sanctions imposed by the FIAU are heard by the court of appeal, and being a general court, the level of expertise necessary to confirm or otherwise the breaches determined by the FIAU and what factors to consider as to whether a sanction is proportionate, dissuasive and effective may be weak,” the report says. When fines are “substantially” reduced by the court, the reason behind this reduction is often “not explained”, nor is any explanation offered as to how this reduced fine could act as a proportionate, effective and dissuasive measure. “This happens even when the same court would have confirmed all, or the greater part of the breaches as identified by the FIAU, as well as their materiality and severity,” the report says. The report does however note that except for a few banks, sanctions imposed by the FIAU on credit institutions are not appealed, as an agreement is reached to implement the directives imposed to address any gaps in their anti-money laundering systems. It said the serious breaches by two credit institutions, a reference to the now defunct Pilatus Bank and Satabank, served as crucial lessons for Malta when it came to anti-money laundering laws. “Both cases have received a lot of public attention, both locally and internationally, and demonstrated the authorities’ commitment and strength in detecting and enforcing effective and proportionate measures for serious breaches of anti-money laundering obligations. “The MFSA has also taken effective measures for the risks identified in both credit institutions, leading to the European Central Bank withdrawing the banking licence of both institutions based on MFSA’s proposal,” the report says.

Title: Man charged with trafficking drugs after dogs sniff cannabis in his car
Body: A driver was on Sunday charged with drug trafficking after customs officials and a sniffer dog found cannabis grass in his car just as he got off the Sicily ferry. Nemanja Bozin, a 36-year-old Serbian national living at Wardija, had just got off the catamaran from Pozzallo on Friday when sniffer dogs first roused suspicion. A search of the vehicle yielded cannabis grass in the front part of the car and also in a container. The driver was arrested and was on Sunday charged with the alleged involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy, importation of cannabis grass as well as possessing the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not intended solely for personal use.  The accused - a maintenance worker on board vessels - pleaded not guilty.  His defence lawyer did not request bail at the arraignment stage and the court, presided over by magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia remanded the accused in custody. Inspectors Mark Anthony Mercieca and John Leigh Howard prosecuted.  Lawyer Roberta Bonello was the defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Keep saying no
Body: An investigation carried out by UN Women UK a few years back found that 97% of women in the UK aged 18 to 24 have been sexually harassed. And 96% of those women did not report the incident because they felt it would not change anything. The research also showed that women who were groped, followed and pressured into sexual activity did not think that their experiences were “serious enough” to be reported. What this means is that this type of behaviour has become so normalised and played down that women have just come to accept it as being par for the course of being a woman. To be female is to be a target. I’ve also found that a lady’s “no” doesn’t always seem to carry the weight it should. In my teenage years, several people seemed to mistake my “nos” for “maybes”, putting me in sometimes very uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations. It was only when I got older and angrier that it got better. Telling a woman in her 30s to smile doesn’t seem to have the same effect it does as when you say it to a vulnerable 15-year-old who’s just realising that not everything is sunshine and roses. Just this week, a Maltese woman claimed that she was filmed without her consent at a local gym. The woman in question was approached at the gym by a small group of men and, after one of them started to work out next to her, he asked her to remove her headphones so that he could flirt with her. She quickly realised that one of the men who had approached her was a Tiktoker known on the platform for his videos of trying to pick up women and messaged to say that she didn’t want to be part of any video or on social media.   Apparently, her “no” wasn’t final enough for the group and one of them kept insisting that they post the video anyway with her face blurred out. She didn’t agree to this either. The footage still went live, though, but with her blurred out (her part has since been removed). It took her taking to social media and a lot of backlash for an apology video to be issued and this was only after she was told that she was blowing things out of proportion. I honestly can’t think of anything more tiring than being a woman. Whether you’re at the gym, on the bus or at the supermarket wearing headphones, why do men feel it’s okay to invade your personal space? Women don’t care how hot you think you are and how sparkling you believe your conversation to be; most of them want to be left alone. We shouldn’t have to say we have boyfriends or husbands at home to justify our “nos” either. How unbelievably sad it is to think that the mere outline of a man that may or may not exist carries more weight than a female’s agency to choose who to talk to and how to spend her time. In a world where your time and body are constantly treated like commodities and the expectation is to give in because you either won’t be taken seriously or made to feel silly, it takes courage to say no.

Title: ‘Significant’ money laundering through property market
Body: The volume of money laundering taking place through the property market could be “significant”, according to a national assessment of Malta’s financial crime risks. The 200-page national risk assessment seeks to identify the country’s money laundering threats and vulnerabilities. This assessment, led by a committee that includes the police and FIAU, says the full scale of money laundering through the property sector is unknown. However, the share of real estate assets frozen in Malta in 2021 was estimated at €44.6 million, thereby indicating that money laundering through the real estate sector is “significant”, the report says. Assets are frozen by the authorities during criminal proceedings involving financial crimes. The assessment pinpoints property as an attractive method for criminals to hide their illicit proceeds, as it allows them to launder large amounts of money in a single transaction. Criminals may also invest in property to rebuild and sell at a higher price, to justify their income, the report continues. In 2021, the government introduced a €10,000 cap on cash transactions for the sale of property and other valuable items. The report highlighted how these rules do not extend to the use of cash for construction, renovation or finishings, thus raising the risk that cash from criminal activities is laundered through property. Similarly, concerns were raised about the rental market, as the rent can give criminals a legitimate income. The report details how buyers and sellers may attempt to reduce their tax dues on property sales by deliberately undervaluing the properties. According to data by the tax authorities, 32 per cent of all property deals in 2021 were identified as being potentially undervalued. The Malta Tax and Customs Administration appoints an independent architect to value the property in cases where undervaluation is identified, according to the report. Buyers would then be obliged to pay tax on the new valuations. An analysis of suspicious transaction reports by the FIAU involving property deals found that the majority of reports had at least one Maltese resident involved, and were mainly about tax crimes.  During a three-year period ending in December 2021, property purchases by foreigners did not register an increase, and Maltese nationals accounted for 98 per cent of the property deeds, the report says. The report also delves into the licensing of estate agents. It says that to date, there has been no enforcement against those operating without a licence. Furthermore, “vulnerabilities” exist in the licensing law, as people continue only acting as intermediaries during property sales “on an occasional basis”.

Title: Alec Baldwin charged with manslaughter over Rust film death
Body: Actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with manslaughter over the deadly 2021 shooting on the set of his film Rust, according to a court document filed Friday. Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, was holding a Colt .45 during rehearsals for the low-budget Western in New Mexico when it discharged a live round, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the October 2021 shooting and said that he did not pull the trigger on the gun, which in any case should have been loaded with a dummy. Friday's development marks the latest attempt to hold someone to account for the deadly episode, which sent shockwaves through Hollywood and led to calls for tightening rules around firearms on movie sets. Initial manslaughter charges against Baldwin were dropped in April last year, due to what prosecutors called "new facts" which demanded "further investigation and forensic analysis." In October, prosecutors said they were convening a grand jury - a group of citizens who assess evidence and decide whether there is a case to answer. "We look forward to our day in court," Baldwin's attorneys Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro said in a statement sent to AFP on Friday. Baldwin reportedly faces up to 18 months in jail if convicted of the new charge. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer - the person responsible for supplying and maintaining weapons - is set to go on trial next month on charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. Prosecutors say that as the person who loaded the gun, she is culpable. She denies the charges. There has been no explanation as to how live rounds ended up on the movie set. Dave Halls, the film's safety coordinator and assistant director who handed Baldwin the loaded gun, agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to six months probation. Filming of Rust resumed last year, and has now been completed, Variety reported, using new locations in the US state of Montana. The cinematographer's widower, Matthew Hutchins, served as an executive producer. He has already settled a wrongful death suit with Rust producers and has said he has "no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame," calling his wife's death "a terrible accident." Director Souza also returned, saying at the time that completing the movie would be "bittersweet" but that the cast and crew "are committed to completing what Halyna and I started."

Title: Man admits snatching café tip jar was 'stupid mistake'
Body: A man who admitted his “stupid mistake” after helping himself to the tips box at a cafeteria, was remanded in custody after admitting to simple theft on Friday afternoon.  Manpreet Singh, a 27-year-old Indian national with a Maltese residence permit, landed in hot water after helping himself to the coins meant as tips for staff at a St Paul’s Bay cafeteria on Triq Censu Tanti.  The theft took place early on Thursday morning and was reported at the Qawra police station at 11 am. Security footage from the shop was also turned in that clearly showed the suspect. Footage showed a man wearing a black hoodie and carrying a red backpack, with the police using stills from the video to send out wanted posters for him. Later on Thursday, police officers patrolling the streets of Marsa spotted a man who appeared to match the description of that wanted person, with his hoodie and backpack also matching the images.  The suspect was approached and informed that he was being placed under arrest and was escorted to the Ħamrun police station where he was given his legal rights. The suspect admitted that he had committed “a stupid mistake.” His backpack yielded some coins which the man admitted had been taken from the tips box at the St Paul’s Bay café. Upon arraignment, Singh pleaded guilty to simple theft of cash amounting to some €150 as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.  Prosecuting Inspector Francesco Mizzi said that the accused had social, economic as well as drug problems which he needed to address and to rehabilitate.  For that reason, an effective term of imprisonment would enable him to rehabilitate himself. The man had previously faced homelessness but had now found somewhere to live and also managed to get a job countered his legal aid lawyer.  The accused was still young and if given a suspended sentence and a treatment order, that would allow him “another chance,” in life, argued the defence.  After hearing submissions on punishment the court presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, deferred the case to next week for delivery of judgment. The accused was meanwhile remanded in custody.

Title: Suspected trafficker nabbed after accepting drug parcel from undercover police
Body: A man, who signed a parcel delivered by a police officer dressed as a postman, was remanded in custody after facing charges allegedly linking him to a drug-trafficking conspiracy.  Mladen Bjelica, a 26-year-old Serbian national living at Mellieha, first landed on the police radar when he was arrested following that controlled delivery triggered by the arrival of a parcel containing two packets of cannabis grass, each weighing 500 grams.  That parcel was flagged to police by customs officers way back on December 27. The controlled delivery was carried out on Wednesday by lead investigator Jonathan Pace who, dressed as a postal worker, went to a Xemxija address indicated on the parcel.  As soon as he reached the street where the address was located, two men approached his van, asking whether he had a parcel addressed to a third party.  Replying in the affirmative, the undercover officer approached the entrance to a garage where Bjelica signed for the delivery, just as police colleagues moved in to arrest the suspect.  Later, police also searched the Mellieħa residence where the youth lived with his father.  Fourteen cannabis plants were found in that residence, together with some fertilizer, masks, laptops and other electronic devices.  During the suspect’s arraignment on Friday, Pace explained that back in November and December other similar packages had been addressed to Bjelica. The suspect pleaded not guilty to importing cannabis grass, complicity in a drug importation and trafficking conspiracy, possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not solely for personal use as well as unlawful cultivation of the plant.  During his interrogation, the suspect had opted not to answer most of the questions as he had a right to and had even started crying, pointed out the prosecutor.  A request for bail was objected to at this early stage, not only because of the amount of drug involved but also because other witnesses, besides police officers and experts, were still to testify.  Those included the accused’s father and owner of the Mellieha residence as well as owners of other residences to which previous parcels had been addressed.  Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca countered that not only was the accused not disposed to approach witnesses but those witnesses were expected to testify about “objectively proven” facts, such as ownership of the properties involved or the accused’s job history.  Bjelica had a fixed job and lived with his father.  Denying him bail would risk his job and would make him unable to contribute to utility payments.  It would have a “snowball effect,” argued the lawyer, highlighting the fact that the accused had complied with police authorities and would likewise obey court orders.  However, after hearing submissions, the court presided over by magistrate Gabriella Vella turned down the request after being told that investigations were still ongoing and civilian witnesses were still to testify.  The court, however, solicited the prosecution to wrap up investigations as soon as practically possible.  Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.  Lawyer Charles Mercieca was defence counsel.

Title: Mtarfa couple charged with abusing young daughters granted bail
Body: A couple who last week were charged with sexually abusing their young daughters for several years and covering it up were granted bail on Tuesday.  The husband, a 43-year-old deliveryman from Mtarfa, is pleading not guilty to defiling the couple’s two daughters, engaging in non-consensual sexual activity and subjecting them to acts of physical intimacy.  The mother, a 42-year-old housewife, who wept throughout her arraignment, pleaded not guilty to permitting the abuse and preventing the minors from reporting it.  The alleged ill-treatment surfaced when the younger girl, who turned 13 on the day of the couple’s arraignment, first opened up about the domestic situation with the mother of a friend during a sleepover.  Soon after the girl, accompanied by an adult, turned up at the Rabat police station to file a report, telling police about the abuse and claiming that her elder sister faced the same plight.  She also claimed their mother was aware of the situation but often warned her not to tell anyone.  Both girls later spoke to police in the presence of officials from the Child Protection Unit. Their allegations triggered investigations which ultimately resulted in criminal charges against both parents.  Upon arraignment, husband and wife pleaded not guilty. Both were denied bail.  Their case was assigned to a Magistrates’ Court which scheduled a first hearing on Tuesday. The couple, who at last week’s arraignment were assisted by a legal aid lawyer, had meanwhile engaged a personal lawyer who filed a fresh request for bail.  After hearing the elder daughter testify behind closed doors the court, presided over by Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, upheld the bail request in respect of both parents.  The mother was ordered to sign the bail book once a week, not to approach prosecution witnesses, particularly the younger daughter who is still to testify, and to bind herself under a personal guarantee of €5,000. The father was granted bail against a deposit of €800, a personal guarantee of €15,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under the strict condition of not approaching prosecution witnesses, especially his daughters.  The protection orders imposed by the court upon arraignment still stand as does the ban on the names of all parties.  The case continues. AG lawyer Darlene Grima and inspectors Godwin Scerri and Wayne Buhagiar are prosecuting.  Lawyer Roberto Montalto is defence counsel.

Title: Traffic policemen cleared by court of overtime racket
Body: Two sergeants from the police traffic section who were accused of involvement in a racket linked to extra duties during works on the Marsa flyover project have been acquitted of all criminal wrongdoing. Judgment was delivered in proceedings against Matthew Azzopardi, 45 and Francis Larry Sciberras, 55. They were charged in July 2020 with complicity in the racket whereby unlawful gains were allegedly obtained to the detriment of the police corps, Infrastructure Malta and/or Transport Malta. The amount allegedly received in unaccounted-for extra duty payments by the two accused totalled some €5,000. The two were also charged with making false declarations as well as committing an offence which, as public officials, they were duty-bound to prevent. They protested their innocence from the very start. It had all started when police received anonymous information that a number of police officers from the traffic section were allegedly stealing fuel, skiving work duties, towing vessels against payment and seeking protection money. Those allegations triggered a probe by the Anti-Money Laundering Squad which focused on the allegation that officers were skiving from work when they were supposed to be performing extra duties.  RELATED STORIES  Prosecuting inspector Lianne Bonello testified that in Azzopardi’s case, police found no evidence of his involvement in any other of the alleged irregularities. Extra duties were services offered by police officers upon the request of a person or entity against payment, according to agreed rates. When those extra duties are done during normal work hours, payment is due to the corps. The prosecution claimed that Azzopardi played a role in a conspiracy with other traffic officers to make unlawful gains through deceit and fraudulent means, claiming payments for services that were actually not rendered by him. Another sergeant, Norman Xuereb, was identified as the alleged brains behind the racket because he was the one who met Infrastructure Malta and Transport Malta to discuss payments. The prosecution claimed that several times, Azzopardi was not found in the area where he was supposed to be but moved about, occasionally tracked down in his home locality. And when he worked extra duties during work hours, he got payment which was rightly due to the corps. After hearing all testimonies and scrutinising all documentation the court, presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove the element of deceit that was one of the requisites of the offence under article 308 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution “completely failed” to produce proper evidence of the fraud allegedly committed through “deceit, devices or pretences” intended to persuade the victim to part with his money and thus suffer a loss. There was no evidence of some sort of communication between the accused and Xuereb to be assigned those duties. Even less so was there evidence that Azzopardi was instructed not to report for work, or to carry out extra duties during normal hours, or to do other duties not related to his detail. And when not found on the spot where he was detailed, there was no proof that he was conspiring with others to evade duties. The prosecution also alleged that certain officers used to swap duties but then failed to produce concrete and conclusive evidence to support this allegation. When all was considered the evidence was too “weak” to convince the court that the two accused were part of a racket and thus the accusation of complicity was not proved. Nor was there evidence that they made any false declaration or to mask something false as legitimate. There was no fraudulent information on the signed time sheets.  Even if the declarations in the invoices were not completely true and correct, the link to the accused was not satisfactorily proved. Moreover, the clients receiving the service never complained with the corps and nor did they ever seek a refund for services not rendered. Former IM chief Frederick Azzopardi testified that police presence had been necessary to expressly monitor the flow of traffic in the areas close to the Marsa project and other ancillary zones affected. The project, described by Transport Malta official, Clint Axisa as “the biggest project we ever had,” went on for two years in one of the island’s most strategic areas and inevitably caused chaos and disruption in the zones through which voluminous traffic flowed on a daily basis. That was why those entities had required both patrolling and static traffic policemen at the time. That evidence supported the version of the accused.  Lawyer Mario Buttigieg was defence counsel for Azzopardi. Lawyers Ludvic Caruana and Maxine Vassallo were counsel to Sciberras.

Title: Candles and flowers at vigil for Sliema murder victim Sandra Ramirez
Body: Flowers and candles were laid out in a vigil for murder victim Sandra Ramirez on Monday evening. The 43-year-old Colombian woman was found stabbed to death in the bed of a Sliema rental apartment on Saturday morning.  Police learnt of the crime when 43-year-old Fabian Eliuth Garcia walked into the Sliema police station and told officers on duty that he had killed someone. He was arraigned on Sunday afternoon and is pleading not guilty.  Monica Zamora Salam shared the details of the vigil, held at the Independence Gardens in Sliema, on Instagram on Sunday evening. She said the vigil would pay tribute to Ramirez and also raise awareness about femicide and violence.    “Those who are interested in joining me can write to me, I will bring candles and flowers,” she said. Speaking to Times of Malta, Monica said she did not know Ramirez, but when she read the news she wanted to do something. "I was shocked and I wanted to make sure that something was done for her," she said. She spoke to Ramirez's family back in Colombia, and said her relatives do not wish to speak to journalists. The vigil was attended by members of the Latino community, Sliema Mayour John Pillow and Honorary Consul of Colombia to Malta Joseph Buhagiar. Flowers and candles were laid at the site and the group held hands and prayed in Spanish. The site of the vigil is the same place where Paulina Dembska, a 29-year-old Polish student was violently murdered in January 2022. The murder horrified the nation and led to the introduction of femicide into the criminal code.    In comments to Times of Malta, Ramirez's employer Karl Micallef said she always had a smile on her face and was always there to help everyone.  “She was hard-working, kind, and always cheerful. Her laugh was special and filled the room,” he said. On Sunday, members of Malta’s Latino community packed the St Gregory the Great Church for Mass, in Spanish, dedicated to the memory of Ramirez.

Title: Suspected drug trafficker arrested by police on third attempt in two months
Body: A suspected drug trafficker arrested on the third attempt within two months was on Monday remanded in custody, while his partner, accused of helping him flee police officers, was also denied bail.  Morat Abdikadir Mohammed Naswanon had been on the police's wanted list for weeks. The 33-year old Libyan national who lives in Valletta has several drug-related brushes with the law. He landed back under police surveillance upon suspicion that he was once again trafficking drugs.  In November the police started surveilling Morat and his partner Judith Bakoush at a hotel in St Julian's. On November 24, officers stopped Morat outside the hotel entrance.  But just as a police officer was about to hand over the arrest warrant, Morat made a run for it and managed to escape. Inside the hotel room occupied by Morat the police found Bakoush and several drugs, including 22 packets of cocaine, seven ecstasy pills and two sachets of cannabis grass.  Bakoush was arraigned and her partner was placed on the police wanted list while investigations continued.  Although his registered address was at a Valletta residence, police checks showed that no Morat was living there.  Further investigations led police to a Qawra address.  But when officers moved in to raid the property on December 26, the wanted man fled through the back door.  The corps then turned on the public, asking for help to track down the man. Investigators meanwhile kept a close watch over his partner who was granted bail on December 20.  The woman breached bail conditions and visited the Qawra residence in the evening after curfew hours. She had been found there when Morat managed to get away.  That time, the inspector handling the investigations had warned her to abide by bail conditions. However she persisted in not signing her bail book at the Valletta police station. Further surveillance led investigators to a third locality - a Kirkop residence where last Saturday the couple were found, together with the owner of the property, Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca told court. This time, they managed to arrest both. Morat and Bakoush were arraigned separately on Monday.  Morat pleaded not guilty to possession of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ecstasy under circumstances denoting that the drugs were not solely for personal use.  He was further charged with failing to obey legitimate police orders, escaping from police custody, committing the crimes within 100 metres of a place frequented by youths as well as relapsing.  He pleaded not guilty.  His lawyers made no request for bail at arraignment stage.  As for Bakoush, she too pleaded not guilty to aiding her boyfriend to escape police and for allegedly breaching four bail decrees and relapsing.  Her lawyer, Franco Debono, pointed out that she had presented medical certificates to justify her failure to sign the bail book. But the prosecutor rebutted that Bakoush had only gone to the doctor on January 7.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution who highlighted the fact that Bakoush allegedly assisted Morat while he was on the run.  She was under four bail decrees, had skipped signing, was out after curfew hours and was staying at other places that were not her registered address.  Besides, other civilians including a third person who was still in hospital - were yet to to testify, argued Mercieca.  The court, presided over by magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request.  Inspector John Leigh Howard also prosecuted.  Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: €1.4m money transfers triggered probe into Konrad Mizzi associate
Body: “Suspicious” money transfers of €1.4 million triggered a probe into a close confidante of ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, Times of Malta can reveal.  Lawyer Aron Mifsud Bonnici ended up on the authorities’ radar after carrying out a series of large transfers to XNT Limited, a Malta-based investment firm. The transfers, the bulk of which started in the summer of 2020, raised tax evasion and money-laundering suspicions, as they appeared to exceed the lawyer’s expected wealth. Further red flags were raised due to Mifsud Bonnici’s previous involvement in numerous government entities, as well as his close ties with Mizzi, who resigned in November 2019 under a cloud of corruption.  A deeper dive into Mifsud Bonnici’s local bank accounts led the authorities to flag notable differences between his declared income and the hundreds of thousands of euros that flowed into his bank accounts annually since 2016. Financial documents seen by Times of Malta indicate Mifsud Bonnici received payments into his personal bank accounts of over €2.4 million between 2016 and 2019. However, during those same four years, Mifsud Bonnici declared a total income of €680,000. The income declarations do not include dividends received by Mifsud Bonnici from the community work scheme and other shareholdings, as tax on these would have been paid at company level. Nonetheless, the discrepancy triggered suspicions of tax evasion due to the difference between his income declarations and the money received in his accounts.  The police’s Financial Crimes Investigations Department have been in possession of information detailing the suspicions since August 2021, according to documents reviewed by Times of Malta. A police spokesman declined to comment when questioned by Times of Malta about the outcome of any investigations and the apparent lack of action against Mifsud Bonnici. Mifsud Bonnici told Times of Malta he has never been sent for by the police, nor been told he is being investigated. He said the money transferred to XNT came from “declared retained earnings from my profession, and dividends that are taxed at source”. The lawyer added there is nothing for the police to investigate, as all taxable income had been appropriately declared to the authorities. He said the payments he received bet­ween 2016 and 2019 include expenses that need to be deducted prior to declaring his income. “Your rendering gives a partial and flawed result, since you have left out all expenses direct and indirect, thus giving an eschewed picture, with disregard to the true and complete picture of the accounts,” Mifsud Bonnici said. A spokesperson for XNT said the company could not comment on “specific details” due to client confidentiality. “XNT Limited reiterate that they have always adhered strictly to all anti money laundering legislation whether local or under EU regulations. “Even in this particular case of Dr Mifsud Bonnici, our clients state that, as is always done with all of their clients, all the necessary due diligence was done and all required documents were passed on to them and all documents were duly verified,” XNT’s lawyers José Herrera and David Camilleri said. XNT Limited was fined by Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) last year for lax internal anti-money laundering controls. The fine was overturned on appeal. This is not the first time that Mifsud Bonnici has been on the police’s radar. In 2022, the local authorities sought help from the United States on cryptocurrency transfers between Mifsud Bonnici and murder suspect Yorgen Fenech. US court filings show the request is linked to an ongoing court case against Fenech to buy a Glock Firearm and Scorpion CZ automatic rifle over the dark web in November 2018. Investigations indicate that Mifsud Bonnici transferred the bitcoins to Fenech on the same day he ordered the firearms. Both men deny wrongdoing. Fenech has been charged with orchestrating the October 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. He denies the charges. The murder suspect has also been linked to corruption with Konrad Mizzi, having profited from Enemalta’s purchase of the Montenegro wind farm, via secret offshore companies. Mifsud Bonnici was a close associate to Mizzi during his time in government. He acted as a legal advisor during the Vitals Global Healthcare deal, which has been mired in fraud and corruption claims. He was also appointed by Mizzi as Ene­malta’s board secretary and was involved in talks leading up to the Montenegro wind farm project.

Title: Man arrested following series of snatch-and-grab thefts in Fgura
Body: A 25-year-old man is being held under arrest in connection with a series of snatch-and-grab thefts in Fgura. The suspect, who lives in Cospicua, was arrested a short while after two women aged 45 and 80 and a man aged 74 filed separate police reports in Paola on Thursday alleging that they had been robbed while walking on the street. He is also believed to have stolen a 74-year-old man’s wallet after shoving him on Triq il-Mater Boni Consilii the previous day. The 45-year-old woman told the police that she had just withdrawn money from an ATM on Triq Hompesch at 6pm on Thursday when a man snatched the money out of her hand and ran away and headed towards Triq il-Karmelitani. The suspect is believed to have then snatched a bag that the 74-year-old man was carrying and a mobile phone from the 80-year-old woman’s hand. At around 8.30pm on Thursday, police officers identified a man matching the description given by the crime victims in the Triq il-Karmelitani area of Fgura. He was immediately placed under arrest and is being held in police custody. Prosecutors intend to arraign him on Saturday before magistrate Leonard Caruana.

Title: Woman found stabbed to death in Sliema as suspect turns himself in
Body: Updated 1.30pm A Colombian woman was murdered in Sliema on Saturday morning.  Police learnt of the murder when a 43-year-old Colombian man walked into the Sliema police station at 6.15am and told officers on duty that he had killed someone.  His clothes appeared to be stained with blood.  The victim, 43-year-old Sandra Ramirez, was found stabbed in the bed of a rental apartment on Triq Sir George Borg.    Officers believe the victim and suspect had argued. Initial indications are that the woman was the suspect's ex-girlfriend. Social media posts suggest the two were close and had travelled abroad together as recently as November. Times of Malta is not publishing photos of the victim or suspect until relatives in Colombia have been informed of the crime.  There is no record of the two having ever filed any criminal complaints or domestic violence reports against one another, police said.  The suspect is being held under arrest and is being interrogated. Ramirez worked at a retail outlet at The Point shopping mall in Sliema. The store remained shut on Saturday, as employees grieved.  "Today we tragically lost a member of our family, not just a member of our staff, a note posted to the store shutter along with a black ribbon read. "Sandra Ramirez was a kind, gentle and hard-working woman who was loved by us all at Mavenry."    A police spokesperson told journalists that police officers were still searching for the murder weapon. Sources said officers are also obtaining CCTV footage from various properties in the area, to trace the victim and suspect's movements in the hours preceding the murder. The murder victim obtained a residence permit in October 2022 while the suspected killer came to Malta in January 2023, immigration records indicate. Officers are now speaking to Colombian consular officials to obtain more information about the victim and suspect, as well as to establish contact with their respective families.  Magistrate Lara Lanfranco will lead an inquiry into the case.   It is the second murder of 2024, following the New Year's Day shooting of Eric Borg in Rabat.

Title: Killing Paulina and Ashling
Body: In January 2021, two women were brutally killed in Malta and Ireland, two countries on opposite sides of the European continent. Paulina Dembska was cornered, raped and killed at Sliema’s Independence Gardens on January 2, 2021. Ten days later, Ashling Murphy was killed as she jogged along the banks of a canal in the Irish midlands. Both women simply happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Both cases sparked a collective sense of grief with vigils held in Ireland and Malta.  Fast-forward to the present and the contrasting progress in the legal proceedings for the accused men underscores a critical issue plaguing Malta’s justice system. Murphy’s killer, Jozef Puska, was convicted last November and handed a life sentence, providing some semblance of closure to her grieving family and the Irish community. In stark contrast, the case against Abner Aquilina, the alleged murderer of Dembska, remains ensnared in the protracted compilation-of-evidence phase. Last week, Dembska’s family shared the agonising pain of reliving the trauma through lengthy court proceedings, saying that true closure can only be achieved when the accused is sentenced. Her eldest brother, Łukasz Dembski, told Times of Malta: “The case is taking too long. We all know who took the life of our sister. I have the impression that the accused received more psychological help than our entire family.” The family has no choice but to relive the nightmare repeatedly, sitting through or reading the horrific court testimonies. And there is no end in sight.  The slow-moving wheels of justice, often exacerbated by weak investigations and never-ending magisterial inquiries, are now a chronic problem. It is also the trademark of a country weighed down by bureaucracy and misplaced resources. The Maltese government appears to be acknowledging the need for reform – proposed amendments to shorten the compilation-of-evidence stage to one year would do wonders to trim down the duration of court cases. The White Paper introduced last May seeks to empower the attorney general to expedite cases when the penalty does not exceed 12 years. One key aspect of the reforms is the elimination of the ‘referral’ process, a bureaucratic hurdle that often prolongs the compilation phase. But there are major concerns whether any proposed changes can be done in practice. The shortage of judges and the limited facilities available for trials by jury pose significant obstacles. So too does the limited pool of talented prosecutors at the Attorney General’s Office, which has been decimated by a series of defections and promotions. Unless the government invests heavily in judicial resources and infrastructure, any proposed changes will sadly remain on (white) paper and justice will continue being delayed. And until that happens  dozens of families will continue suffering in silence: Lassana Cissè was gunned down in 2019 for being black – his alleged killers are out on bail, awaiting trial. Eleonor Mangion Walker was found dead in 2016, her body dumped under wooden pallets in a warehouse. The accused is still awaiting trial by jury. Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in 2017 for doing her job. The triggermen have been convicted but the man charged with conspiring to kill her is still sitting through the reopened compilation of evidence. There are too many cases to chronicle here. Swift and fair justice is not only a right for the victims and their families but also a cornerstone of a functioning and compassionate society. The comments made by Dembska’s family last week are a poignant reminder that justice delayed is justice denied.

Title: World-renowned UK conductor charged with child sex crimes
Body: World-renowned British conductor Jan Latham-Koenig has been charged with child sexual offences, London’s Metropolitan Police said on Friday. Latham-Koenig was the first British-born conductor to become artistic director of a Russian opera company, and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2020 for services to music and UK-Russia cultural relations. “Jan Latham-Koenig, 70,... was arrested at London Victoria Train station on Wednesday 10 January,” the police force said in a statement. “He was charged the following day... with arranging/facilitating a child sexual offence and sexual communication with a child,” it added. During his time at the Novaya Opera (New Opera), he staged Moscow’s premiere of Richard Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde, one of the cornerstones of Western classical music. The Novaya Opera was founded by former Moscow city mayor Yuri Luzhkov to be an opera for the people – cheaper and more accessible than the better-known Bolshoi. Its founding director Yevgeny Kolobov was universally admired but the house then floundered after his death in 2003, rediscovering its momentum under Latham-Koenig’s leadership. Latham-Koenig was due to appear at London’s Westminster Magistrates Court on Friday, police said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Two teenagers arrested in St Paul's Bay following theft from jewellery shop
Body: Two teenagers were arrested in St Paul's Bay following the theft of jewellery items from a shop on Triq Dawret il-Gżejjer. The 17-year-olds, from Sweden, were first spotted at around 3.45pm by police officers on patrol on Triq il-Merluzz. When the teenagers saw the officers, they fled, with the officers giving chase.  The officers managed to catch up with one of them, while the other one fled the scene. At that same moment, the officers were informed of a theft from the shop. The two young men that had just been chased by the police fitted the description of the suspected thieves. The police said in a statement that while the youngster was getting into the police car, he threw away a golden bracelet. The police searched for the other young man at his residence, where they found another golden bracelet and a watch, also stolen from the shop. The two are expected to be charged in court in the coming days.  Police investigations are ongoing.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'It's bicarbonate of soda': man charged with possession of cocaine tells police
Body: A man tracked down inside a hotel room with drugs in his possession told police officers he was carrying bicarbonate of soda in his backbag. Denis Cremona was found in a St Paul's Bay hotel after the court issued an arrest warrant when he failed to sign a bail book and attend proceedings over drug-related charges. The car of the 48-year-old, who has no fixed address, was spotted outside the hotel on Thursday. Checks at the hotel led the officers to Cremona, who was staying inside a room which, when searched, yielded an amount of drugs.  A suspicious substance - which Cremona insisted was bicarbonate of soda - was found inside his backbag.  Sachets of suspected heroin and cocaine, as well as drug-related paraphernalia, were also found inside a sofa. He was arrested shortly before 1pm on Thursday. Within 24 hours, he was escorted to court and charged with possession of cocaine and heroin under circumstances denoting the drugs were not intended solely for personal use. He was also charged with committing the alleged offences during the operative period of a suspended sentence that was confirmed on appeal in January 2023.  The accused pleaded not guilty.  A request for bail was objected to in view of the accused’s untrustworthiness.  Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb countered that the law provided for treatment rather than imprisonment in case of drug dependence in terms of Chapter 537 of the laws of Malta.  As for the alleged breach of bail, nothing was put forward about that issue in court. Moreover, the prosecution did not mention any civilian witnesses and the consequent fear of tampering with evidence, argued the defence.  However, after hearing submissions by both parties the court, presided over by Magistrate Lara Lanfranco, turned down the request.  Inspector Christian Cauchi prosecuted.

Title: Three out of five FIAU fines issued in 2023 remain unpaid
Body: More than 60 per cent of the fines issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit last year are unpaid. According to information given in parliament by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, the FIAU issued a total of €3.36 million in administrative fines against 144 companies or individuals. Of these, only €1.4 million were paid by 96 subject persons. He was replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Jerome Caruana Cilia. Caruana said that one must keep in mind that fines determined by the anti-money laundering body can be changed following a court decision. Moreover, when an FIAU decision is appealed before the court, the fine established by the body is not paid because that penalty is not considered final. It is only paid after a court decision. The court has challenged several fines issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit over the past years, with different judges ruling against its “dangerous” system in the imposition of fines since it was acting as prosecutor, judge and juror. The constitutional court also declared the fines as being unconstitutional as they breached people’s fundamental right to a fair hearing before an independent court. Last year, one judge described the system the FIAU was using as “institutionalised incest”. “Without case law and jurisprudential teachings, even common sense dictates that such punishments… penalties, call them what you may, must be imposed by a court as constitutionally known… and not by a body of an administrative nature that operates in an opaque manner and [laden] with conflicts and interests,” Mr Justice Toni Abela ruled. There were at least five decisions against the anti-money laundering watchdog, with many other cases still pending before the constitutional court. According to information given in parliament last October, the FIAU had 21 constitutional cases filed against it. Until then, the unit spent €147,000 in legal fees. In 2019, the unit imposed 19 fines and collected a mere €37,000. The following year, the unit issued 170 fines and collected just over €2.1 million, including fines that had been pending since 2016. In 2021, the FIAU issued 176 administrative fines and collected almost €1.2 million in fines, including one pending since 2018. In 2022, the FIAU issued 145 fines and collected €3.5 million.

Title: Court confirms six-year jail term for man convicted of rape on first date
Body: A man who was sentenced to six years imprisonment for raping a woman he met on a blind date has had his punishment confirmed on appeal. The case dates back to August 2019 when 27-year old Tyson Grech went to a wine bar with the victim after the two had met on social media. The then-19 year old woman later told police how that evening they ordered wine and after drinking one glass she declined more since she was not accustomed to drink. But her companion insisted and she ended up having two more glasses. They left the bar and walked to his car, but from then on, she had no other recollections. The following morning she woke up in unfamiliar surroundings, finding herself in her underwear, an ache in her private parts and Grech lying next to her on the bed. In spite of her repeated refusal, he forced her to have sex, doing so twice and later gave her a ride home. At first she did not intend to report the matter to the police but after speaking to her mother and officers from Appoġġ, she changed her mind. Grech was eventually charged with rape, non-consensual sex, holding the woman against her will and breaching bail, as well as recidivism. In 2021, he was found guilty of rape and breach of bail by a Magistrates’ Court and condemned to a six-year effective jail term and fined €2200. A further €2800 in bail money was also to be confiscated. Grech appealed on several grounds, including his claim that there were inconsistencies in the victim’s version. When delivering judgment on Thursday the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri, concluded that although there were certain inconsistencies, that did not mean that the victim’s version was untrue. The woman was scared and did not at first plan to file a report. Even when testifying, she appeared reluctant to divulge certain details. However her attitude was composed and fearful, sometimes bursting into tears. On the other hand, Grech came across as “arrogant,” seemingly proud to have had sex with the victim “three times.” The judge concluded that any inconsistencies in the woman's version were not so substantial as to make the court doubt what she said. Even if she had consented to sex in the evening, that did not mean that she did so the following morning, when she repeatedly told Grech, “no, I don’t want.” The appellant produced footage at appeal stage which he claimed to have retrieved from the “cloud.” But that video appeared to show a sexual session in the dark and even if it was meant to prove that the victim had consented first time round, that did not mean that she consented next morning. Besides, the figures in that footage were not identifiable, the court said. Nor did the appellant prove that his mother was at the flat at the time of the alleged rape. As for the punishment, the judge concluded that it tended towards the minimum in terms of law. The appeal was rejected and the punishment confirmed together with the ban on publications of the victim’s name. Inspector Eman Hayman prosecuted.

Title: Man accused of molesting pedestrians, resisting police
Body: A man who allegedly molested passersby in Valletta on Wednesday and put up a violent struggle when the police turned up, has been taken to court and remanded in custody.   Prosecutors said a report was made to Valletta police station on Wednesday about a man, later identified as 24-year old Damien Attard, who was molesting people in Republic Street. When police officers approached him he reacted aggressively, insulting and spitting at them. He put up a struggle when they tried to arrest him. After he was finally arrested and taken to the police station, he kept up his aggressive stance and hurt one of the officers. Attard was escorted to the court in handcuffs on Thursday and remained handcuffed until Magistrate Noel Bartolo caught sight of the metal restraints behind the accused’s back and asked why they were still on.  “He was still rather agitated,” explained the prosecuting officers. The magistrate ordered the escorting officers to remove the cuffs and the accused to sit down quietly. Attard then pleaded not guilty to attacking and violently resisting four police officers, insulting and threatening them, slightly injuring one of them, refusing to obey legitimate orders, wilfully breaching public peace, swearing, relapsing and also breaching two bail decrees. Defence lawyer Franco Debono asked whether the accused had told police that he had been attacked “by other persons” in Wednesday’s incident. Inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Daryl Borg said that it all started when the accused began to molest passersby. He did mention that “someone” had confronted him but he could not identify that person. That was when the trouble started but as soon as police arrived, Attard did not give them the chance to speak. He behaved aggressively and used physical violence against the officers, said the prosecutors. A request for bail was objected to because the accused was deemed untrustworthy and also because of the gravity of the charges. This was not the first time Attard landed in trouble for attacking public officials and had in fact, been convicted of similar charges by a Magistrates’ Court. Besides, the address on the police system was not the accused’s current address and that in itself amounted to a breach of bail, prosecutors said. The defence countered that the accused was presumed innocent and there was no fear of tampering with evidence since the main witnesses were police officers. There was also some doubt in respect of the dynamics of the incident. The court rejected the request for bail in light of the nature of the offences and the fact that the accused did not offer the necessary guarantees in terms of law. Inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Daryl Borg prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Title: Teenager in court for threatening his mother
Body: A young man has been refused bail after being accused of threatening his mother and causing her to fear violence. The mother filed a police report against her 17-year-old son, a drug addict, a few days after Christmas after he crept up behind her brandishing a knife.  The teenager, accompanied in court by his father, stood blank-faced, hands limp at his sides throughout a hearing during which he pleaded not guilty to causing his mother fear of violence, insulting and threatening her and misusing  electronic communications equipment. Prosecuting Inspector Audrey Micallef explained how last Tuesday his mother had filed a police report about her son who had been making use of illicit substances for the past three years. She had been warning him to take care of his health, pleading with him to kick the habit, and there were many times when she had stopped short of reporting him to the police. But the situation came to a head after Christmas. On that occasion, there had been no arguments between mother and son. So the woman got a terrible shock when she turned round and found the teen standing right behind her with a knife in his hand. “You thought it would be the last day of your life, didn’t you,” he told her, evidently sensing her shock. After that episode, the mother began to receive life-threatening messages from her son. Unable to bear it any longer, she went to the police. When summoned by the police, the teen replied, “if you want to talk to me, you come.” Following that call from the police, the teen upped his dose of messages to his mother, peppering his messages with insulting and offensive language. The teen pleaded not guilty and said that he had recently landed a job at a retail store. A request for bail was objected to in view of the fear of tampering with evidence, especially since the alleged victim is still to testify and also because of the serious nature of the offences. Although his criminal record was “not alarming” the situation on the home front had been ongoing for three years and there was fear that he might commit further wrongdoing if granted bail, argued the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Martina Herrera, assisting the accused as legal aid, argued that the teen was still presumed innocent and he was trying to turn his life round after going through a rough patch. “The drug problem has greatly improved since I started working,” piped in the teen, in a calm and soft voice. He had also been to Caritas and lived with his father, added the defence. “So how was his mother involved?” asked presiding Magistrate Noel Bartolo. Parte civile lawyer Mario Buttigieg stepped in, explaining that the mother was so scared that she left the family home and moved to their summer residence. Her son had only been to Caritas for a couple of days. The parents wished to put their son back on track and were hoping for a treatment order in that respect, said Buttigieg. The prosecutor pointed out that the accused had confessed that “the problem” still existed but he expressed “a great wish” to address it. After hearing submissions the court turned down the request for bail and recommended that, in view of the fact that the accused was a minor, he be detained at YOURS, the young offenders unit. The court also upheld the request for a treatment order, explaining its implications to the teen and warning him of the consequences if he were not to follow orders given by those persons who would be monitoring him. The court also banned publication of all parties’ names to safeguard the interests of the minor. Lawyer Helga Buttigieg Debono also appeared parte civile.

Title: South Africa accuses Israel of breaching Genocide Convention
Body: South Africa on Thursday accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention, saying that even the October 7 Hamas attack could not justify such alleged actions. Pretoria has lodged an urgent appeal to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Israel to "immediately suspend" its military operations in Gaza. Israel has dismissed the case as "atrocious" and "preposterous".  RELATED STORIES  "No armed attack on a state territory no matter how serious... can provide justification for or defend breaches of the convention," said Pretoria's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. "Israel's response to the October 7 attack has crossed this line and given rise to the breaches of the convention," he added, setting out South Africa's case at the ICJ. The war in Gaza erupted when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack, which resulted in about 1,140 people killed in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,357 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. South Africa argues Israel is breaking its commitments under the UN Genocide Convention, a treaty signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust. Top lawyer for South Africa Adila Hassim said Israel's bombing campaign aimed at the "destruction of Palestinian life" and had pushed Palestinians "to the brink of famine". "Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts," she said. As a fellow signatory to the treaty, South Africa can take Israel to the ICJ, which rules on disputes between countries and is often described as the "World Court". The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel. South Africa has acknowledged the "particular weight of responsibility" of accusing Israel of genocide. It has "unequivocally" condemned the Hamas attacks that touched off the war in Gaza. Israel will present its own arguments Friday but President Isaac Herzog has already hinted at his country's likely defence. "There's nothing more atrocious and preposterous than this claim," said Herzog. "We will present proudly our case of using self defence... under international humanitarian law," he said.  RELATED STORIES  Herzog said the Israeli army was "doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties". The United States is backing its ally Israel, with the State Department describing the charges as "unfounded". "In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews," said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. As it is an urgent procedure, the ICJ could rule in a matter of weeks. Its rulings are final and cannot be appealed. However, countries do not always follow the court's verdicts - the ICJ has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, for example. But a court ruling against Israel would certainly increase political pressure on the country, with many speculating it could serve as a pretext for sanctions. Cecily Rose, assistant professor of public international law at Leiden University, said the court did not have to rule on the fundamentals of the case at this stage - that issue will likely take years. "Instead, the court would only be evaluating whether there is a risk of irreparable prejudice to rights held under the Genocide Convention, in particular the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts that threaten their existence as a group," Rose told AFP.

Title: Murders in Malta are increasingly involving firearms, data indicates
Body: The use of firearms for murders has been constantly on the increase, with guns being used for more than a third of murders in the last five years, up from a quarter in the previous five, according to crime historian Eddie Attard. The three homicides in 2023, however  – two women and a man were killed – did not involve the use of a firearm, while a shotgun was used in the first murder of 2024. Attard, a former police officer, said that with three murders in 2023, Malta still has among the lowest homicide rates and is one of only a handful of countries where no murders took place in a particular year.  RELATED STORIES  Since the beginning of the 21st century, there have been two years, 2003 and 2006, when no homicides occured. However, while in the past one woman was killed for every two men, that trend is now reversed: there were years when more women were killed than men, or the number of women killed was equal to that of men. Since 2019, Malta has had 23 homicides. In approximately 70% of the cases, the victim or the accused person was a foreigner. The first homicide of 2023 took place on January 18 when Pelin Kaya was walking in front of the Paul and Rocco service station in Gżira when a BMW S6 driven by Jeremie Camilleri, veered sideways, hitting her and the petrol station before crashing into a fast-food restaurant. Kaya, a 30-year-old interior designer originally from Turkey, had been on her way to meet her boyfriend after celebrating her 30th birthday with friends. She was taken to Mater Dei Hospital but died sometime later. Footage had captured the moment of impact as well as the driver getting out and flinging stones at the victim as she lay on the pavement, motionless.  Camilleri is pleading not guilty to her murder. The murder is one of just four in Malta's criminal history that was allegedly carried out voluntarily using a vehicle, Attard noted.  Almost nine months later – on October 15 – Malta witnessed the double murder of a couple from Marsa. A 34-year-old Ghanaian national, Iddrisu Faisal, is pleading not guilty to the murder of his landlords Joe Bartolo and his partner, Carmen Abela. They were both stabbed to death inside their residence along Triq it-Tiġrija, in Marsa. A bolt cutter is believed to have been used. Faisal was seen walking away from the crime scene, bare-chested, carrying a long metal object, raising his arms while shouting ‘Allahu akbar’, it emerged in court. Faisal also stands charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm in respect of a brother and sister who were renting rooms at the former horse-riding school where the murders took place. During the compilation of evidence against Faisal, the court heard two other co-tenants testify about how Bartolo regretted taking in Faisal as a tenant after rent-related arguments repeatedly broke out between them. Matters came to a head on that Sunday morning. A neighbour cleaning out bird cages on the roof of his residence across the street from the Marsa stables had reported hearing screams. He saw a Black man banging with all his might on the farmhouse door with a long metal object. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Suspected mugger arrested after victim saw him walking past police station
Body: A suspected mugger was arrested on Thursday after his alleged victim saw him walking past the police station shortly after filing a report. Hamza Mohamud Ibrahim, a 29-year-old Somali national who is homeless and jobless, was escorted to court on Friday afternoon as the suspect behind the mugging which took place at around 9.30 pm yesterday. The victim turned up at the Marsa police station at around 10 pm on Thursday claiming that he had been walking along Triq Dicembru 13 when someone grabbed him by the shoulder, attacked him and stole his Samsung mobile phone.  The man also gave a physical description of his male aggressor, including his clothes and later supplied a medical certificate which classified his injuries as slight.  But just as the alleged victim stepped outside the police station, he spotted the suspect and headed back inside to alert the officers.  Two policemen approached the suspect who put up a struggle and violently resisted arrest. During the arrest, one of the officers’ smartwatches was damaged and the policeman’s hand was injured.  The suspect was finally restrained and searched.   Five sachets of a greenish substance, later certified as a synthetic drug, were found in his possession, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa when giving an overview of the events leading up to the arrest.  The suspect was hospitalised and charged following his discharge earlier on Friday.  Under interrogation, Ibrahim could only recall “some mobile” but no further details of the incident.  He did, however, say that he was addicted to the synthetic drug.  Assisted by two interpreters, the accused pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft, slightly injuring his victim, violently resisting arrest, wilful damage to third party property, unlawful possession of drugs as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.  His legal aid lawyer, Martina Herrera, did not request bail.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Gatt, upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the victim and remanded the accused in custody.  AG lawyer Shelby Aquilina also prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Pistorius released from prison on parole, 11 years after shooting partner dead
Body: South Africa's ex-Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was released from jail on parole Friday and "is now at home", authorities said, almost 11 years after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in a crime that gripped the world. Having served more than half his sentence, the 37-year-old double-amputee was quietly whisked out from the Atteridgeville prison on the outskirts of the capital Pretoria, avoiding the hordes of media gathered outside. "He was admitted into the system of Community Corrections and is now at home," the Department of Correctional Services said in a statement. Pistorius, known worldwide as "Blade Runner" for his carbon-fibre prosthetics, will not be allowed to speak to the media as a condition of his parole. Prison authorities had previously warned the press that there would be no opportunity to photograph or speak to him.  Pistorius killed Steenkamp, a model who was 29 years old at the time, in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house. The shooting came a year after Pistorius made history by being the first double-amputee to race at Olympic level when he appeared at the London 2012 games. He was found guilty of murder and given a 13-year jail sentence in 2017 after a lengthy trial and several appeals. He had pleaded not guilty and denied killing Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar. The morning ahead of his release, Steenkamp's mother June issued a statement saying that while she accepted the decision of the justice system and conditions of his parole, "the pain is still raw and real".  "There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back," she said.  "We, who remain behind, are the ones serving a life sentence." Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half their sentence. Pistorius lost a first bid in March when the board found he had not completed the minimum detention period required to be let out. The Constitutional Court in October ruled that was a mistake, paving the way for a November hearing that approved his release. As part of his parole, until the end of his sentence in 2029, Pistorius must undergo therapy for anger and gender-based violence issues. He will also be banned from consuming alcohol and other substances, required to complete community service and also be home at certain hours of the day.  The conditions "send out a clear message that gender-based violence is taken seriously" by the country's justice system, June Steenkamp said Friday.

Title: Home Affairs Ministry condemns violent Paceville attack
Body: The Home Affairs Ministry has condemned the violent attack filmed in Paceville earlier this week, saying that having a licence to work as a security guard is not a carte blanche to commit violence. A spokesperson for the ministry was replying to questions sent by Times of Malta, shortly after news of the attack went public, about reform the government had promised after a similar attack in 2019. On Tuesday, footage first published by Lovin Malta showed around five bouncers savagely beating a man lying motionless on the ground, cradling his head as he was kicked repeatedly and hit with what appeared to be a retractable baton. In 2019, after CCTV video captured an unlicensed bouncer kicking a man in the head, Michael Farrugia, who was home affairs minister at the time, had said that the government was in talks to revamp the law regulating bouncers. This came amid complaints that employers were finding it difficult to hire licensed bouncers at the time.   Asked whether plans for the reform were still in the pipeline after the incident, the spokesperson said that violence on the streets was not a matter up for reform but a matter of “basics”. “Having a security licence does not give you a licence to commit acts of violence. The appalling act of violence that happened in Paceville is not a question of reform but a question of basics, violence is simply not on,” the spokesperson said.  RELATED STORIES  He added that, in recent years, the Malta Police Force has allocated more resources to operate “intelligence-led policing” in Paceville. This has resulted in a “significant drop” in bodily-harm crime in St Julian’s, which registered its third-lowest crime rate in 25 years, according to the last annual crime report. Lower rates of bodily-harm crime were only registered in 2020 and 2021, during which COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were in place. The government is always open to more reform and investment, the spokesperson added, with more projects in the pipeline to improve security in Paceville. As announced in the budget plans for 2024, LESA will be investing in a technology project that includes cameras connected to both the agency’s control room as well as the police headquarters to serve as a deterrent against crime.

Title: Today's front pages – January 5, 2023
Body: The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Friday. Times of Malta and L-orizzont lead with news that a 21-year-old bouncer has denied seriously injuring a man outside a Paceville nightclub on New Year's Eve and claims he was the victim after being stabbed with a broken bottle. Times of Malta also reports that supermarket owners and importers are facing government pressure to reduce the recommended prices of a range of staple grocery products by up to 15 per cent starting this month, as inflation continues to bite.   The Malta Independent, L-orizzont and In-Nazzjon separately report that the government will be asking the court to allow it to intervene in a case filed by the Opposition against the State Advocate over alleged inaction in recovering funds from the hospitals' deal. In another frontpage article, The Malta Independent reports that BOV is refusing to divulge information about the developer that will be turning the bank's Attard branch into apartments. In-Nazzjon also refers to UĦM directives issued to University of Malta’s non-academic staff to work to rule over delays in the conclusion of their collective agreement.

Title: The three murder cases that turned New Year's Day into tragedy
Body: When Eric Borg was shot dead outside his hometown in Rabat on Monday, it was just over thirteen hours into the New Year. The killing of the 27-year-old taxi driver marked the third time in 224 years a murder has been perpetrated on New Year's Day.  And according to crime historian Eddie Attard, it is unusual for murders to be carried out in the first month of the year.  “January has the least number of murders, with 28 documented since 1800,” Attard told Times of Malta.   The murder on Monday has revived memories of a double tragedy that took place 12 years ago on New Year's Day. Malta entered the New Year in 2012 with the news that Duncan Zammit, 32, and Nicholas Gera, 26, had died of multiple stab wounds in Zammit’s apartment. At the time, the police were unaware of the motives and had not established any links between the Zammit family and Gera, who entered the home in the early hours of the first day of the year. It was witnessed by Zammit's wife, Claire while their three-month-old twins were sleeping in another room. She called her father, entrepreneur Angelo Xuereb, and the emergency services following the accident. In a magazine interview, she recounted the shock of waking up and seeing her husband “fighting for his life”. The motive remains a mystery and, 12 years on, the case is still unresolved.   The first reported homicide to take place on New Year’s Day in Malta happened in 1879 when Vincenzo Cucciardi's body was found in his home in Cospicua. Following days of investigations which led to nothing, the authorities guaranteed impunity from prosecution to any accomplice who would reveal the identity of the killer and the circumstances surrounding the murder. It also offered a prize of 100 scudi (around €1,900) for information. A man called Ċikku Attard told the police that he had information about two crimes. He claimed Wenzu Bonanno was the mastermind behind the murder and he had managed to lure a certain Toni Ellul, the victim’s son-in-law, to join him in the crime. Around midnight, two other men, Wiġi Darmanin and Ċikku Farrugia, went to Cucciardi's house to rob him. At the time of the robbery, Ellul was also there. After stealing various silverware and valuables, Cucciardi was stabbed to death. During the robbery, Attard stayed close to the door and later on told the police that he had fled the scene of the crime. While Attard was given a pardon for providing information on the accomplices, the police could not find Ellul as he had fled Malta. Apart from this murder, Attard also provided the police with information about another murder that took place on December 29, 1879, when Francesca Bellia was murdered by Farrugia and Bonnano. A year later, on January 21, 1830, a trial against Darmanin, Farrugia, Bonanno and his wife, Maddalena Bonnano began and all were charged with theft and murder. All three men were given the death penalty and were executed in Floriana on February 3, 1830. Maddalena Bonanno was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. January 21, 1837 Rożi Ciangura was thrown into a well in Mtaħleb, limits of Rabat by her husband, Feliċ Ciangura. Her death is the first homicide reported in Malta since 1800. Feliċ managed to flee Malta and, after 19 years, returned. He was later charged with his wife’s murder and consequently sentenced to life imprisonment. January 2, 1893 George Godwin, an English sailor, was murdered by 24-year-old Ġużeppi Vella during a dispute behind a prostitute’s door in St Anne's Street in Valletta. Vella tried to skip the queue, insisting that he should go first. An argument broke out between the two men and Godwin was strangled to death. January 2, 2022   Paulina Dembska’s body was found at the Independence Gardens in Sliema. The 29-year-old Polish student was raped and murdered in the early morning. Abner Aquilina was charged with murder and the case is still ongoing. Officers previously testified that Aquilina told them “the devil” made him kill the Polish student and a court heard that his confession was recorded on a police bodycam. The murder horrified the nation and, following countless protests and mounting pressure by women’s rights groups, Malta introduced the concept of femicide in the criminal code in June 2022. January 18, 2023   Just one hour into her 30th birthday, Pelin Kaya was walking home from a small birthday celebration when she was killed after a car ran her over. Kaya, originally from Istanbul, was an interior designer who lived in Gżira, not far from the crash site, and had been living in Malta for over a year. Jeremie Camilleri was charged with murder and the case is still ongoing. He pleaded not guilty to wilful homicide and causing property damage.

Title: IS jihadists claim Iran suicide bombings that killed 84
Body: Updated 6.15pm The Islamic State jihadist group said Thursday that it carried out twin bombings that killed at least 84 people at a memorial ceremony in Iran for slain Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani. The claim from IS came as Iran observed a day of national mourning for those killed in Wednesday's blasts. In a statement on Telegram, IS said two of its members "activated their explosives vests" among the crowds who had come to honour Soleimani on the anniversary of his death in a targeted US drone strike in Baghdad four years ago.  RELATED STORIES  Iranian investigators had already confirmed that the first blast at least was the work of a "suicide bomber" and believed the trigger for the second was "very probably another suicide bomber", the official IRNA news agency reported earlier, citing an "informed source". Soleimani, who headed the Guards' foreign operations arm the Quds Force, was a staunch enemy of IS, a Sunni extremist group which has carried out previous attacks in majority-Shiite Iran. The death toll was revised down from around 100 the day after what Iranian authorities labelled a "terrorist attack" that also wounded hundreds near Soleimani's tomb in the southern city of Kerman.  Iran has suffered deadly attacks in the past from jihadists and other militants as well as targeted killings of officials and nuclear scientists blamed on arch-foe Israel. On Thursday, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi spoke to ISNA news agency about bolstering security over its porous borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.  He said authorities have identified "priority points to block along the border" with the two countries, which has long been a key access point for militant groups, drug smugglers and irregular migrants.  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday blamed "evil and criminal enemies" of the Islamic republic, without naming them, and vowed a "harsh response". Regional tensions have surged amid the Gaza war sparked when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched their deadly October 7 attack on Israel, which Tehran welcomed while denying any involvement. President Ebrahim Raisi's deputy chief of staff for political affairs, Mohammad Jamshidi, charged on social media platform X that "the responsibility for this crime lies with the US and Zionist (Israeli) regimes, and terrorism is just a tool". The United States rejected any suggestion that it or its ally Israel were behind the bombings, while Israel declined to comment. "The United States was not involved in any way, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous," said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.  "We have no reason to believe that Israel was involved in this explosion," he added, expressing sympathies to the victims of the "horrific" explosions and their families. Regional tensions have surged since the Gaza war erupted, drawing in Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Hamas fighters infiltrated Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.  In response, Israel launched a relentless offensive that has reduced vast swathes of Gaza to rubble and killed more than 22,300 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. Iranian authorities called for mass protests against the Kerman blasts after weekly prayers on Friday, when officials said those killed would be laid to rest. Revising the death toll, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told IRNA "The number of martyrs... has been announced as 84 so far." Iran's emergency services chief Jafar Miadfar pointed to difficulties identifying dismembered bodies and said some victims were mistakenly counted "several times". He said 284 people were wounded and "195 are still hospitalised". Revered by many Iranians, Soleimani oversaw Iranian military operations across the Middle East, and millions came to his funeral in 2020. Current Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani suggested the Kerman crowd was "attacked by bloodthirsty people supplied by the United States and the Zionist regime".  He pointed to two recent killings widely blamed on Israel -- a Beirut strike on Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri, and the killing near Damascus of senior Guards commander Razi Moussavi in December. "The killing of Aruri and people like Razi Moussavi and the crime in Kerman show how desperate the enemy is," Qaani said. Iran regularly accuses its arch-foes Israel and the United States of inciting unrest, and authorities last month executed five people convicted of collaborating with Israel. In July, Iran's intelligence ministry said it had disbanded a network "linked to Israel's spy organisation" that it said had been plotting "terrorist operations" across Iran. In September, the Fars news agency reported that an IS-affiliated key "operative", in charge of carrying out "terrorist operations", had been arrested in Kerman.

Title: 'Multiple gunshot victims' in Iowa school shooting: sheriff
Body: Updated 6.20pm A shooting on Thursday at a high school in the midwestern US state of Iowa left "multiple gunshot victims," local authorities said, adding the incident was over but without confirming if anyone had been killed. The shooting at around 7.30am (1330 GMT) triggered a major police response as emergency vehicles and armed units rushed to the Perry High School, where classes had not yet started for the day. "We are still unclear exactly how many are injured or what the extent of those are, but we are working on that right now. There is no further danger to the public," Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante told reporters gathered at the school. Broadcaster NBC reported that the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, citing multiple law enforcement officials. "An officer first arrived within seven minutes of (a radio) activation and located multiple gunshot victims," Infante said. He said that there were "very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome, in that sense." He added that the authorities had identified the shooter, but didn't give any further details, including on any arrest or deaths. "The community is safe. We're just now working backwards, trying to figure out everything that happened," Infante said. CNN reported that Thursday was scheduled to be the first day of classes for the new semester, according to the school district's calendar. Perry is about 55 kilometres from the state capital, Des Moines. Gun violence is common in the United States, a country where there are more firearms than people, and where attempts to clamp down on their spread are always met with stiff political resistance. The country has already recorded three mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nongovernmental organization that defines a mass shooting as four or more people wounded or killed. Last year ended with a total of 656 such shootings. School shootings in particular have become a totemic reminder of the country's political deadlock. In May 2022, a man killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. The Perry shooting comes less than two weeks before the Iowa caucus, the country's first contest kicking off the primary season for the 2024 presidential election. Guns are likely to once again be a hot topic of debate this election cycle, though with little legislative action expected.

Title: Bouncer denies Paceville beating charges, claims he was a victim too
Body: Updated 12.56pm A 21-year-old bouncer has denied seriously injuring a man outside a Paceville nightclub on New Year's Eve and claims he was the victim after being stabbed with a broken bottle. Riald Gragjevi appeared in court on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to causing grievous injuries by using improper arms against Idriss Ahmed Adem in an assault that was caught on camera. Gragjevi, an Albanian national who lives in St Paul's Bay, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon as he attempted to board a flight out of the country. Police officials at the airport recognised that the man was connected to the Paceville beating and he was arrested by officers from the Rapid Intervention Unit.    Inspector Brian Xuereb told the court that he had been working the night shift between December 31 and January 1 when he responded to a report that a person was unconscious in St George’s Road in Paceville. When Xuereb arrived on the scene, an ambulance was called for the victim - Sudanese student Ahmed Adem - and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was found to have been suffering from grievous bodily harm.   Xuereb added that earlier in the evening a security guard had filed a police report saying that he had been assaulted and injured with a broken bottle, and it was determined that the report had been made about the victim. Gragjevi was arrested when police were alerted that he was trying to board a flight out of Malta and leave the country. The police inspector said Ahmed Adem is also wanted by police and is being investigated in connection to the security guard's injuries.    Defence lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi told Magistrate Joe Mifsud that while they would not be asking for bail at the time being, his client maintained his innocence and that he had been a victim himself. "My client was stabbed by a broken bottle and suffered an injury that required eight stitches in the shoulder," he said, adding that two other bottles were thrown at him after the stabbing.  Ghaznavi said his client was not trying to abscond from Malta and that his plane ticket had been bought three weeks before the incident. The lawyer, assisted by lawyers Charlton Gouder and Jessica Formosa, urged the prosecution to bring civilian witnesses to court as quickly as possible so that a case for bail could be made.  Footage of the brutal attack, first published by Lovin Malta, showed around five bouncers kicking and hitting a man lying motionless on the floor as horrified onlookers watched.  The victim also published a video showing that he had tried to get the police to intervene with an issue he was having with the club bouncers prior to the beating.    Asked by the court who he worked for, Gragjevi said he worked in security.  Kerber Es Ltd, the company responsible for some of the bouncers involved in the incident, has declined to comment due to ongoing police investigations.

Title: UN top court to hear genocide case against Israel next week
Body: The UN's top court will hear submissions next week from South Africa and Israel after Pretoria opened a case for what it called Israel's "genocidal" acts in Gaza. South Africa wants to International Court of Justice to urgently order Israel to suspend its military operations in Gaza, in a case which Israel rejected "with disgust." The ICJ "will hold public hearings at the Peace Palace in The Hague... in proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel," on Thursday 11 and Friday 12 January, the court said in a statement. The South African application, filed last Friday, related to alleged violations by Israel of its obligations under the Genocide Convention, saying that "Israel has engaged in, is engaging in and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza." Israel rejected the charge, with Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat writing on X, formerly Twitter: "Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application" to the ICJ. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added Israel displayed "unparalleled morality" in the Gaza war as he too dismissed South Africa's charge. South Africa, amongst other urgent measures, is asking the court to order that "Israel shall immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza" and that both countries "take all reasonable measures within their power to prevent genocide." Israel launched a relentless military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian militants carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7. The militants' attack left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's ongoing Gaza offensive has killed more than 22,300 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. South Africa will present its arguments on Thursday of next week, while Israel is set to counter on Friday. A ruling by the ICJ on the request for emergency measures is expected to follow within weeks, but the case proper could still take months or even years. Set up after World War II, the ICJ is the UN's highest legal body and rules in disputes between countries. Decisions are legally binding, but the court has little power to enforce them.

Title: Suspect in Rabat murder confessed to officers wearing bodycams, sources say
Body: The prime suspect in the New Year’s Day murder of Eric Borg confessed to police officers as he was being arrested, sources told Times of Malta on Tuesday. Noel Azzopardi, 39, is expected to be arraigned and charged with Borg’s death. He gave himself up to police in Rabat on Monday afternoon, as officers began a manhunt following the Triq il-Fidloqqom shooting.  Borg, a 27-year-old cab driver, was found bleeding on a pavement in the street close to his home. He had been shot twice using a shotgun. Emergency responders pronounced him dead at the scene.  Sources told Times of Malta that Azzopardi walked into the Rabat police station and gave himself up. His confession was captured on the officers’ bodycams. The two men had reportedly argued in the hours preceding the shooting.  Under Maltese law, the police have 48 hours to arraign a criminal suspect from the moment of arrest, meaning they must charge Azzopardi in court by Wednesday afternoon.  Sources told Times of Malta that he is being represented by lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri and Alex Miruzzi .  Magistrate Charmaine Galea is leading an inquiry.

Title: Times of Malta journalists reveal the story behind the story
Body: Every year we ask Times of Malta journalists to share the story they worked on in the last 12 months that left an impact on them and why. Here are their choices for 2023.    Documentary evidence is the gold standard for any article. I realised I had hit such a goldmine as soon as I started delving into thousands of WhatsApp messages exchanged between a Transport Malta employee and top government officials. The chats made me angry. They detailed how ex-Transport Minister Ian Borg, ministry officials and even the prime minister’s assistant “helped” Labour-leaning voters get an easy ride during their driving tests. There was apparently little regard to the dangers of short-circuiting a system designed to keep potentially unsafe drivers off the road.  Prime Minister Robert Abela even had the gall to dismiss the practice of “helping” voters in such a manner as a normal part of Malta’s political system. Employers slammed Abela’s suggestion as an “invitation to anarchy”. Insurers urged the authorities to force all those who benefitted from the racket to retake their driving test. Doctors echoed their demand. The Opposition called the government endorsed system a “licence to kill”. The police were conspicuously silent. There was not much they could say, having sat on the same evidence I had obtained for over a year. To date, only three Transport Malta officials have been charged with trading in influence.   Top government officials who passed on the names of candidates to the Transport Malta employees have escaped any consequences. These include Borg, the prime minister’ assistant Rachel Debono, the Gozo Minister’s chief of staff Michael Buhagiar and former OPM official Ray Mizzi, who now works as a customer care official in minister Michael Falzon’s secretariat. The invitation to anarchy continues.   “I don’t have any photos of my son,” Christine sighed sadly on the other end of the line. “They took everything”. Christine was describing how scammers locked her out of her Facebook, Instagram and Google accounts, where she meticulously documented her son’s childhood through photos, and convinced her to record a blackmail-style video in the desperate hope of getting them back. Christine was just one of countless victims of a crypto investment scam that spread like wildfire over the summer. Some lost money, others lost access to their social media accounts, often having to rebuild their business accounts from scratch. Shockingly, some even had to watch in horror as a deepfake likeness of themselves promoting the scam was shared online. I spoke to several people who fell victim to the scam. Many of them were cagey, either embarrassed at having been scammed in the first place or angry that a stranger was asking them to relive the experience. Christine was guarded. Once bitten, twice shy.   “How do I know you are who you say you are?”, was the first thing she asked. A fair question, given the circumstances. Several reassuring emails and messages later, with my identity finally verified, Christine opened up, showing me copies of the long chats between herself and the scammers. The chats were shocking, the scammers moving seamlessly from false empathy and concern one minute, to cruel taunts and threats the next. Meanwhile, there was Christine, desperately trying every trick in the book to get her accounts back, pleading with the scammers, threatening to involve the police and, eventually, giving up. News about scams often goes under the radar. “That would never happen to me”, we sneer whenever we come across stories of scam victims, “I’d never fall for that”. Perhaps we won’t. But, as scams become more sophisticated and harder to detect by the day, we all have something to learn from Christine’s story.   It’s 6.30am on January 18. Still half-asleep, I reach out for my mobile and start my usual routine of scrolling through social media to see if anything happened during the night. That’s when I saw a post about a woman being killed after a car ran her over. The details were scarce, but looking at the photo I realised that this had happened next to a KFC restaurant that was less than a five-minute walk from my home. The dawn sky was still a faint purple colour when I arrived there. It was a disaster. Glass shards, broken rubble, and metal were scattered all around. A handful of police officers and bystanders crowded around the black BMW that had run over Pelin Kaya and crashed into the restaurant window.  Shortly after publishing the story, sources and neighbours of the BMW driver, Jeremie Camilleri, reached out to me with information about him. I recall one of Kaya’s colleagues telling me, over the phone, that she was the pedestrian victim killed just one hour into her 30th birthday as she was walking home from a small birthday celebration at the time. As the week progressed, Pelin Kaya’s murder and her story continued to make headlines. When I watched Kaya’s family lay her birthday cake  at the site of her death, the true weight of what had happened hit me. The cake was covered in references to the 1990s sitcom Friends, including the lettering ‘the one where Pelin turns 30’ and the unnerving phrase “why God, why”.   Her sister, Derya, was on her knees, weeping as she sang Happy Birthday over her sister's cake. I cannot describe the emotions that overcame me at that moment. With the help of two Turkish journalists I had the opportunity to sit down with Pelin’s mother, Çiçek, who recalled how she could hear her daughter’s voice when she visited the site of her murder. The cake is long gone and the flowers placed during that vigil have been replaced many times. Every time I walk past that area, I think of Pelin Kaya and hope her family will get some form of justice soon.   Christmas is a time when the best of humanity is on show. People look to spend time with their loved ones and donate to charitable causes. When I stumbled on a story about workers at a Christmas Village going unpaid, I couldn't help but think of the irony. JK Security Services Limited provided labour to the 2021 Ta’ Xbiex Christmas Village and promised their workers between €6 and €7 an hour. But nine foreign nationals employed by the subcontracting company were left unpaid for hundreds of hours' worth of work. "I didn't even get a single euro to survive, eat food or pay rent," one of them told me. The workers only had a verbal agreement with the company, leaving them with nowhere to turn.   "We were not working legally, so what could we do? If I went to the authorities, I could have been deported," one said. After we published the story, the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations said they were investigating the issue. Many non-EU nationals are often unaware of Maltese laws, afraid to report abuse to authorities, and willing to accept illegal working conditions to survive. I’ve spent much of 2023 writing about the exploitation of non-EU nationals and trying to expose the shifty employers who look to capitalise on their vulnerability.  Unfortunately, the abuse of workers appears to be for life, not just for Christmas.   “He was the centre of my life,” Isabelle Bonnici cried at the opening session of the public inquiry into the tragic death of her 20-year-old son Jean Paul. Her cry was echoed by John Sofia in the final stages of the inquiry: “My world has ended,” the victim’s father said, his voice cracking as he wrapped up his testimony. All those following proceedings were left momentarily speechless. Jean Paul Sofia was buried alive under the rubble of a Corradino factory that came crashing down like a stack of dominoes. It was another construction tragedy that shocked the nation. Memories of court proceedings related to the tragic death of Miriam Pace – another civilian buried alive – were still fresh in my mind when I found myself sitting through 15 sessions of the Sofia public inquiry, starting in mid-August. Through it all, I observed Jean Paul’s parents, united in grief but steadfast in their resolve to get answers about their son’s death, no matter how uncomfortable.   Their determination to kickstart a public inquiry, casting a spotlight on the construction industry, was an admirable feat. Taking the witness stand, must not have been easy. But Isabelle and John overcame any qualms and testified not only for the sake of their son but also to ensure that others would not go through a similar experience. They battled the darkness that came down on them as they watched their son’s lifeless body being pulled out of the rubble, setting out on a quest for justice which brought hope that long-needed changes in the construction sector might finally materialise.   2023 seems to have been characterised by stories of local communities struggling with disruption and chaos in their localities. Once-tranquil residential areas have been facing the frustration of unruly construction, traffic, hygiene issues, noise pollution and out-of-place activity as they are commercialised, and in the case of The Strand in Sliema, transformed into a pumping nightlife mecca. When I agreed to meet the inhabitants of this supposedly upmarket, seaview-apartment area, I saw a route I had often hurriedly taken in a completely different light. As I walked through a dark, narrow tunnel to the beat of loud music, sandwiched tight between bars and restaurants and their extended outdoor seating areas, I could see how these had replaced much-needed parking spaces, while double and triple parking created obstacles on the busy main road. They were also a hazard for residents in case of an emergency, with access, both along the pavement and into their homes, being hindered by the unbridled occupation of public land. The group of residents were vociferous about their distress in the face of rising fumes from illegal eateries beneath, the wild behaviour of drunk and rowdy revellers, as well as the drowning out the relaxing sounds of the sea and all the reasons why they invested in these properties.   Trapped in their apartments, unable to use their terraces due to the din, stench and dangers from the chaos below, their protest was eventually met with a promise of enforcement action. Months later, however, I still receive a barrage of e-mails from the residents on a wild-goose chase of a spate of authorities, highlighting the problems in the “lawless” entertainment hub. I duly file these in a separate and ever-growing folder, as, together with other illegalities I have highlighted in the area, they continue to fester.   People often expect us journalists to identify the good people from the bad people. They expect us to compartmentalise heroes and villains to make sense of this very complicated life. The more I work in this profession, the more I realise real-life people are rarely heroes or villains. The disability benefits racket stood out to me as one of the boldest examples of that reality. It wasn’t immediately clear to my colleague Jacob Borg and myself how big the racket was, until we began to untangle it and saw its magnitude unravel before us. Hundreds of people had defrauded taxpayers thousands of euros each, silently and comfortably pocketing an extra income every month without anyone ever batting an eyelid for years before the police got wind of it. ‘These are some bad people,’ you’d think to yourself in the face of overwhelming evidence. It turned out most of them were also very sick and poor. People often tell me, ‘Does that justify what they did?’ Of course not, but it humbles us into understanding that the issues are far more complex.   In all fairness, some cheats were neither poor nor sick. They walked into the racket knowing very well what they were doing. But these people were also led to believe the powers that be were on their side, only to realise – when they found themselves before the police – that their own party and people were nowhere to be seen. And that’s one other thing that really impacted me this year. Seeing these people thrown under the bus, seeing Jean Paul Sofia repeatedly shunned by the government he voted for... It got me thinking. When you get into trouble and you think you have too many friends to rely on, no matter who you are, you’ll most likely be alone.   Journalism can often feel frustrating, with the wheels of change moving slowly at best or all too often, remaining stationary. But not always. In May, Times of Malta received a tip-off about an apartment in Sliema housing large numbers of workers. I went to take a look. The situation that greeted me was alarming; around 40 foreign workers were paying up to €250 a month each, sleeping up to nine in a room with only three bathrooms and one kitchen between themselves. Towels tied to bunk bed railings provided only limited privacy, while food packets, suitcases, clothes and pots and pans littered the floor. Some beds were just mattresses on the floor. The conditions were cramped, unsanitary and unacceptable. We have a word for that: slum. Just as shocking were the stories of the tenants. They wanted to leave but said they couldn’t because “most people don’t rent to an Indian or someone from Bangladesh”. And with many of them working in the lowest-paid jobs, such as food couriers, their options were limited. Meanwhile, their landlord – who we estimated could have been raking in around €8,000 per month in rent – seemed to be living it up, his profile photo on Facebook showing him enjoying a day out on a speedboat.   Readers were understandably shocked at the conditions inside the apartment. Within hours of the story being published, police accompanied by officials from the health and housing departments swooped on the property. I waited for changes to the law that would ensure such situations couldn’t re-occur. But nothing happened. Then in December, proposed amendments to rent laws were announced. The changes mean landlords will no longer be able to register rental properties with more than six tenants who are not part of the same family. While the problem will likely not disappear overnight, it is both heartening and encouraging to see that change can and sometimes does happen.   Workplace accidents and injuries have become so commonplace that we are almost desensitised to any injury short of death reported. One such person was Mekhi, a 22-year-old Sudanese man who lost his leg after he fell into a cement mixer. Although Mekhi’s story grabbed people’s attention at the time it was reported, most of us did not think much about what became of the young man after his ordeal. That changed for me when, through the work of the YMCA, Mekhi went public with his story and revealed that he had ended up homeless as a direct result of the incident. He was kept in an induced coma for three weeks and awoke to find his left leg amputated and his right severely mangled. As he started his journey of recovery, Mekhi’s roommate decided to leave the country. Unable to pay rent on his own, Mekhi ended up evicted and forced to sleep on the streets. He even contemplated suicide before he was able to find help. Once is a tragedy, but multiple is a pattern of behaviour. At the start of January 2023, there were 87 pending magisterial inquiries into workplace deaths and injuries.   Foreign workers tell us how they come to this country seeking better prospects in industries that are constantly asking for more personnel. Despite this, they end up exploited, forced to subsist on meagre wages and live in sub-optimal housing. And finally, as Mekhi’s story illustrates, when they are injured on the job and are no longer of value to their employers, they are discarded. The contrast between how we perceive ourselves as welcoming and charitable versus how we treat those we perceive as strangers must be reckoned with. There is no us and them when it comes to basic human decency.   Three years ago, Agnes Mudembo told me about her horrific ordeal in Malta. Agnes was flown over as a housekeeper, leaving her three children behind in Zimbabwe. She was paid €250 a month to work seven days a week, had her passport confiscated, survived on her employer’s leftovers and banished from the house when she fell ill. Once she was helped out of the cycle of abuse and exploitation, she wanted to give something back to the country.   Her resilience struck me as a journalist, and her story stuck with me as a mother. We remained in touch as she juggled two jobs, saved enough to rent her own place, was reunited with her children, was granted refugee status and read for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the University of Malta. But despite being given the go-ahead to settle in Malta, Agnes was not allowed to work within the public health sector. As the world marked Refugee Week this year, we reported that health authorities had told Agnes she was ineligible to work for the government because as a non-EU national, she had not proven she was granted long-term resident status in Malta or that she was married to an EU national. Having a refugee status, they confirmed, did not make her eligible for the post. Unfortunately, Agnes is not the only one in this position… she is just the only one brave enough to speak up.   When people experience a tragic, unjust loss, they are often reluctant to speak to us journalists. They think we are out to get them and lawyers advise them to stay away. But more often than not, this sentiment changes, and they realise that the media may be the only answer to the inaction. In 2023 I interviewed several people who spoke up, for the first time, years after an incident occurred. It is always a humbling privilege to be trusted with their sensitive stories. The sisters of Sion Grech opened up – 18 years after Sion was murdered – about their devastation that no one was found guilty of the crime. They blamed the justice system for the outcome. Desiree Grech Rosso felt the law that allowed her fathers’ alleged killers to “get away with murder” should change. Her father, Albert Brian Rosso, disappeared in 2005. The two men charged were cleared after statements in which they admitted to the murder were scrapped by the courts. The son of Lino Cauchi, Paolo, described how his life was shaped by his father’s murder. Cauchi went missing on February 1982, when his wife was three months pregnant with Paolo. In 2023 the family was awarded €615,000 compensation for shortcomings in the investigations. The murder remained unsolved.   Catherine Degabriele appealed for someone to speak up a year after her husband, army sergeant Christian Degabriele, was killed when he was hit on the head by a boat’s propeller while diving. The siblings of femicide victim Bernice Cassar spoke about how nobody from the state had apologised to them for the various shortcomings that left Bernice’s two children motherless. Days later, the prime minister apologised to them on the state’s behalf.   In April, an article I wrote made me realise the impact of journalism. A month and a half earlier, I learnt of four university students who had been arrested and strip-searched; at the time, it was described to me as “unjust” and “unlawful”. “How so,” I asked. These four students had found a security flaw in a local business’s software and had sent an email to the company informing them that people’s data was at risk. Email addresses, location data and Google calendars were all exposed. In the email, they followed a global practice and asked the company for a bug bounty: prize money that many tech companies offer and reward white hat hackers for finding bugs, errors and flaws within their software.   Instead of receiving a reward, the students ended up being arrested under suspicion of unauthorised access. After many interviews over the next month – where I had to scramble to learn the intricacies of data protection – and many drafts that did not quite cut it, the story finally came out. “'We wanted to help': Students arrested after exposing FreeHour security flaw,” the headline read, with a photo of the four of them beneath it. I remember my heart pounding. All that work was now there, condensed into a four-minute read. All I could do was hope people would read it. That morning, when I walked into the office and in group chats, it felt like everyone was talking it. It was one of the biggest thrills. And somewhere in that excitement, I discovered how influential our jobs can be.   No parent should have to bury their child. Two stories that struck me in 2023 were both related to the quest of two mothers seeking justice for their children, who they had to bury prematurely. I would not have wanted to be a hair on Isabelle Bonnici’s body when she learned that the architect responsible for the collapsed timber factory that killed her son, Jean-Paul Sofia, had blamed him for his own death. And I also wouldn’t have wanted to be in Josephine Boni’s shoes when the court ruled that burying her young daughter in a plastic bag without the parents’ knowledge did not breach her rights or her daughter’s. As a parent, I cannot fathom the hurt these mothers must have endured, still grieving the loss of their precious children.   It was a particularly difficult piece to pen that Adriana Zammit, who is facing criminal proceedings over Sofia’s involuntary homicide, claimed “contributory negligence” by Jean Paul Sofia since the victim should not have been on site at the time of the incident. A magisterial inquiry into the incident found a litany of shortcomings that led to the building’s collapse. In the Boni case, the ruling about the plastic bag burial case came hot on the heels of another judgment in April that exonerated a cement truck driver from all criminal responsibility for Johanna Boni’s death. Boni, 27, was at a stop sign on her motorbike when she was run over on January 5, 2016. She was on her way to work when she was hit by a truck driver. The driver was cleared of criminal negligence after the court ruled that a miscalculated manoeuvre by Boni when she tried to overtake the heavy vehicle had contributed to the fatal impact. This perplexed her parents who wondered how the court could have reached such a conclusion. The Attorney General appealed that verdict, arguing that the magistrate wrongly interpreted the evidence produced during the compilation of evidence. We will see where that appeal leads. But it all makes me wonder what value we are giving to human lives. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Former world champion cyclist charged with causing his wife's death
Body: Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has been charged over the death of his Olympian wife, Australian media reported Monday, after allegedly hitting her with a car. Melissa Hoskins, a retired track cyclist who represented Australia at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, died in hospital after suffering what police said were "serious injuries" on Saturday evening.  Her husband Dennis, 33, is a highly regarded former professional who won the world time trials in 2018 and 2019, as well as a 2015 stage win in the Tour de France.  South Australia Police said a 33-year-old man, widely reported to be Dennis, had been charged with "causing death by dangerous driving" and "driving without due care and endangering life".  "The driver is known to the woman," police said, without confirming his name.  The international association of women cyclists said it was "shocked" to learn of Hoskins's death.  "We send our thoughts to those who love her, starting with her children, and were lucky enough to ride with her during an all too short life," CPA Women said on social media. Hoskins, 32, rode in the Australian team that won the team pursuit event at the 2015 Track Cycling World Championships in France.

Title: Two suspected of stealing man's wallet, damaging car in Marsa
Body: The police are questioning two suspected thieves in connection with a Marsa robbery on Friday evening. The suspects, a 37-year-old Birżebbuġa man and a 29-year-old woman from Cospicua, are believed to have stolen a man’s wallet from his car and then damaged the vehicle. In a statement on Saturday, the police said the two had first approached a man on Triq is-Salib and asked him for money. As they did so, the woman is alleged to have stolen the man’s wallet from inside the car while the man kicked the vehicle. Both made a quick getaway but the victim immediately filed a police report and described the assailants to officers. Police officers found the woman a short time later at Triq is-Sajjied, Marsa and the man inside a bar nearby. The two are being held for questioning by the police.

Title: Hundreds of survivors of Christmas attacks in Nigeria desperately wait for aid
Body: Crammed inside a church in the central Nigerian town of Bokkos, hundreds of survivors of deadly Christmas weekend attacks desperately await aid as they mourn their loved ones killed in the latest spiral of violence in the troubled region. Nearly 200 people died in attacks that began in the evening of December 23 and lasted through the morning of December 26 in Nigeria's Plateau State, wracked by violence for years. Religious and ethnic tensions have for years roiled the province, which lies between the  Muslim-majority north and mainly Christian south. The attacks led to nearly 20,000 people, mostly women and children, leaving some 20 villages around Bokkos and Barkin Ladi. They are now sheltering in 23 camps set up by the Red Cross. "We were cooking when the gunmen attacked our community. We had to run for our lives. We didn't even know where we were running to," said Lucy Joshua, who lost seven members of her family. "At the moment, I don't know where some of my children and grandchildren are." Joshua said the survivors had been supported by the Red Cross, while the church and Bokkos residents had provided food and clothes. "No one from the government has helped us, but we are told that they are coming," said Josephine Matthew, whose husband, brothers and children perished, adding that there was a severe shortage of food and water. The church in Bokkos is ill-equipped for the influx and access to drinking water, toilets or medical care are severely lacking.  "The attackers killed a lot of people. They burned our houses and farm produce. We are really in a sorry situation, we need everything to survive," Abigail Moses said. Nuruddeen Hussain Magaji, a local coordinator for the Nigerian Red Cross, said there was a "dire need" for aid.  "They need food, water, clothes, sanitary hygiene products," he said, adding that the survivors also needed psychological support to with the trauma.  The identity of the attackers is not yet known.   During a visit to the region on Wednesday, Vice President Kashim Shettima said aid would arrive shortly. "I will personally supervise it, and ensure that none of it is hijacked by any body," said Caleb Mutfwang, the state governor. Yuhanna Audu from the national rescue agency NEMA told AFP that supplies were coming and distribution should start within two days.  Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has ordered "security agencies to immediately move in, scour every stretch of the zone, and apprehend the culprits". Northwest and central Nigeria have been long terrorised by bandit militias operating from bases deep in forests and raiding villages to loot and kidnap residents for ransom. Competition for natural resources between nomadic herders and farmers, intensified by rapid population growth and climate pressures, has also exacerbated social tensions and sparked violence. A jihadist conflict has raged in northeastern Nigeria since 2009, killing tens of thousands of people and displacing around two million, as Boko Haram jihadists battle for supremacy with rivals linked to the Islamic State group. UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement he was "deeply alarmed" by the Christmas weekend attacks. "The cycle of impunity fuelling recurrent violence must be urgently broken. The government should also take meaningful steps to address the underlying root causes and to ensure non-recurrence of this devastating violence," he said.

Title: Mosta chapel reported vandalised on Friday, cleaned up by Saturday
Body: Graffiti sprayed on the façade and side wall of a Mosta chapel were cleaned up by Saturday morning.  On Friday, independent candidate Arnold Cassola, and separately, the Mosta local council said the chapel of St Paul the Hermit, in Wied il-Għasel, had been vandalised. “The mayor, architect Chris Grech, has written to the concerned authorities so that this big mess is remedied as soon as possible,” the council told its Facebook page followers.    Police confirmed that reports were filed and said they were investigating the vandalism.      Photos posted by the local council show several crosses, graffiti tags and an expletive in Spanish spray painted across the lower parts of the rural chapel’s façade and side wall. On Saturday morning, Grech said the green and brown spray paint that defaced the chapel had already been cleaned up by the chapel’s caretaker. The chapel is particular in that it is built in a cave within Wied il Għasel - a valley that is protected for its high landscape and ecological value. The valley is often frequented by hikers, photographers and Mosta residents on short walks.    You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'Exhausted' Gazans desperate for war to end as Israel presses offensive
Body: After nearly three months of deadly strikes, incessant displacements and sputtering humanitarian aid, "exhausted" Gazans say they are desperate for an end to the fighting as Israel's war against Hamas looks set to grind on into the new year. The Israeli army kept up its campaign across the length of the Gaza Strip on Friday in the face of mounting international pushback, with UN chief Antonio Guterres reiterating his call for "an immediate humanitarian ceasefire", and South Africa initiating a case against Israel in international court. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, warned of the growing threat of infectious diseases as fighting displaces more and more Gazans, forcing them ever further south towards the already-overcrowded city of Rafah. "Enough with this war! We are totally exhausted. We are constantly displaced from one place to another in cold weather," said 49-year-old Um Louay Abu Khater from a camp in the southern border city. "The bombs keep falling on us every day and night. We expect missiles (at any moment), while others are preparing for New Year's Eve celebrations." The UN says more than 85 per cent of Gaza's 2.4 million people have fled their homes, with many now going hungry and braving the winter rains in makeshift tents. An Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has led to dire shortages of food, safe water, fuel and medicine, with aid convoys offering only sporadic relief. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees said Friday that one such convoy had come under fire from Israeli forces the day before, without causing any casualties. Ahmed al-Baz, 33, said the year drawing to a close had been "the worst in my life". "It was a year of destruction and devastation," he said. "We went through hell and encountered death itself." "We just want the war to end and start the new year at our homes, with a ceasefire declared," he added.   The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's bloody October 7 attacks on Israel, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. The Palestinian Islamist militants also took about 250 people hostage, more than half of whom remain inside the war zone, some of them believed dead. Israel's relentless military campaign since then has killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Israel's army says 168 soldiers have been killed inside the territory. A Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas say. Speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, a Hamas official said the delegation would give "observations" on the proposal and seek "guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal" from Gaza. Israel has yet to formally comment on the Cairo plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that "we are in contact" with the Egyptian mediators and promised the captives that "we are working to bring them all back". The US news outlet Axios and the Israeli outlet Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire. In Rafah, 27-year-old Youssef Ahras told AFP he hoped the negotiations could "stop the bloodshed... because the price of war is so high". "I don't know a lot about the political aspects because as locals, we are busy with our essential needs," he said.   South Africa on Friday filed an application at the International Court of Justice to start proceedings against Israel for what it said were "genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza". In its filing, it asked the court to "protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people". Responding on the social media platform X, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat wrote that "Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application". South Africa has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often linking it to its own struggle against apartheid. Pretoria has strongly condemned Israel's response to the Hamas attacks and has recalled all its diplomats from the country, with Israel in turn recalling its ambassador in South Africa. Key Israeli ally the United States, meanwhile, announced on Friday the approval of a $147.5 million sale of 155mm high-explosive artillery munitions and related equipment to Israel from US Army stocks. The secretary of state determined that "an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale" of the weaponry, thereby waiving the normal requirement for review by Congress, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

Title: Banks can be held liable for scams that hit clients
Body: Banks could be held partially liable when their clients fall victim to credible-looking scams, according to new guidelines issued by a financial watchdog. The Financial Arbiter has devised a model to apportion blame when banks and other payment providers fail to adequately alert their clients about scams that replicate their normal channels of communication. These often come in the form of an SMS that appears to originate from your bank, and often contains a link taking you to a fake website designed to steal your personal and financial information. In two recent decisions highlighted on the arbiter’s website, Bank of Valletta (BOV) was held party responsible when its clients lost money due to scams. One decision saw financial arbiter Alfred Mifsud order BOV to refund 40% of the losses incurred when a client clicked on a link in an SMS that he believed was from the bank.  RELATED STORIES  Following the instructions given after clicking on the fraudulent link, the BOV client made a payment of €4,250 to a bank account in Lithuania. During the hearings before the arbiter, the client blamed BOV for allowing the fraudster to penetrate its SMS channel and for failing to notice that the payment was fraudulent. On the other hand, the bank maintained that it was fully compliant with the law and that the complainant was entirely to blame for being defrauded due to gross negligence. After consulting with a security expert, the arbiter confirmed that the SMS was a spoof rather than a penetration of the BOV’s systems, and there was nothing the bank could have done to prevent it, other than issue adequate warnings to customers. In this case, the arbiter found the client was 60% at fault for the fraud, with the rest of the responsibility falling on BOV. The client’s fault was increased due to his “full cooperation” with the scammers in making the fraudulent payment. However, the bank was also held partially liable as the client had not received any direct warning about such fraudulent schemes in the months leading up to the scam. The fact that the client did not have experience in carrying out similar payments was also deemed as a mitigating factor. In another decision, a BOV client fell victim to a fraudulent SMS that he thought came from the bank. The message contained a link leading to a website that appeared identical to the bank’s. The client then went on to make a €3,259 payment to the fraudster’s bank account in the Baltics. While the bank argued that the payment could only have been executed because the client followed the fraudster’s instructions, the complainant claimed that BOV had failed to adequately protect him from the scam. In this case, the arbiter initially decided that the client had shown gross negligence, allocating 100% of the blame to him. In conclusion however, the arbiter decided that the responsibility for the fraudulent payment was to be shared between the complainant and the bank, with the bank bearing 20% of the responsibility and the complainant bearing 80%. As a result, the arbiter ordered the bank to pay the complainant €651.80, or 20% of the total amount lost. Geoffrey Bezzina, who chairs the management board within the arbiter’s office, urged all customers who believe they have fallen victim to a financial scam to first lodge a formal complaint with their bank. “Provide as much detail as possible about what occurred. If you disagree with the outcome determined by your bank, you have the right to escalate your complaint to our office,” Bezzina said. Bezzina said that to ensure fairness, consistency and transparency, the arbiter has developed a model to determine responsibility in these cases, thus ensuring that decisions are evidence-based and consistent. “In fact, we encourage banks to revisit complaints from the past few months and proactively apply this model, potentially enabling reasonable reimbursements,” Bezzina said.

Title: Police raid Sicily by Car office in fraud probe
Body: Police from the financial crime unit have raided the Sicily by Car rental franchise as part of a fraud investigation, seizing several card payment machines and other equipment.  Sources said the police raided the Italian car rental company’s office at Malta International Airport on Tuesday. The Maltese franchise holder is notorious entrepreneur and alleged kidnapper Christian Borg.  Sources said the raid was conducted by the police Financial Crimes Investigations Department. Some 10 officers descended on the company’s airport office, seizing several EPOS machines and other equipment, including laptops and computers.  It is understood that the raid was part of a wider fraud investigation involving the controversial car rental franchise in Malta. Sources said the police entered the premises and ordered everyone to leave.  No arrests were made but the police left with the company’s equipment.    When contacted, a spokesperson for the car-leasing company told Times of Malta they had no comments to make about the matter.  Founded in 1963, Sicily by Car has a network of more than 60 offices across Italy and a car fleet of more than 20,000 vehicles. It took the market by storm in Malta, offering aggressively competitive prices.  The parent company was forced to distance itself from Borg, after he was allegedly involved in a kidnapping. Borg, 30, of Swieqi, was arrested and charged in court in January last year in connection with a botched kidnapping in a case that is believed to have stemmed from the theft of cars.   He is among a group of six who stand accused of kidnapping a man in January last year and threatening to torture him and rape his sister. Borg and two of his associates are also the subjects of a money laundering investigation which is looking into how drugs may have been purchased from the dark web using cryptocurrency.  Borg owns Princess Holdings Ltd, which has run the local franchise for Sicily by Car auto-rental service since 2020. He is also listed as the company's sole director.   RELATED STORIES  Borg resigned as director of his other companies, such as No Deposit Cars, following his arraignment. Those companies are now being run by other people.  Borg used to be a client of Robert Abela when the prime minister used to practise law. The two were also involved in a property deal together. He hit the headlines again last March following revelations by Times of Malta that his car hire-purchase company, No Deposit Cars Malta, made customers sign contracts accepting that their vehicles may have GPS tracking devices installed. Scores of customers have filed judicial protests asking for their contracts with the company to be rescinded and calling for a police investigation into tax evasion and fraud.

Title: Court turns down PN's request to urgently hear hospitals' deal case
Body: The Opposition’s request for urgency in its case filed against the State Advocate over alleged inaction in recovering funds from the 'fraudulent' hospitals' deal was turned down by the court which, however, observed that the lawsuit deserved priority. It scheduled a first hearing in January.  That was the outcome of a decree delivered by Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti on Friday following objections to the request filed on Thursday by the State Advocate who argued that there was no legal basis for urgency. The State Advocate on Thursday said there was no legal basis for urgency in what was a “purely political case". Opposition Leader Bernard Grech and Nationalist MP Adrian Delia filed the case on Tuesday, requesting the court to order the State Advocate to take action against “present and past government officials involved in the [hospitals privatisation] deal”.  They followed up that request by calling upon the court to handle the case with urgency since the subject matter was of national interest. After considering the Opposition’s request and the State Advocate’s objections, the Court concluded that it did not sense the need for urgency as claimed by the applicants. Their request was not made within the context of constitutional proceedings.  In this case, upholding the applicants’ request would signify that the Court would have to shorten time limits that are usually applicable in such cases, and schedule the case for hearing irrespective of whatever other cases are scheduled on its list, including those adjourned for judgment.  A party calling for urgency must put forward grave reasons why the case deserves precedence.  The Court did not doubt that this case generated national interest, but the applicants failed to explain why it merited urgent handling.  After all, it was for them to show that if the case is afforded hearing in line with normal procedure - which, after all, provides for expediency in respect of all cases - they or the country would suffer irremediable consequences, observed Mr Justice Grixti.  There was also a “serious distinction” between the applicants’ claims.  They first requested the court to declare that the State Advocate had the power to sue for recovery of the defrauded funds and then asked the court to order the State Advocate to take action.  That second request went far beyond the merits concerning the powers and duties of the State Advocate.  While not envisaging the need for urgency as claimed by the applicants, the court nonetheless felt that this case deserved priority and thus ordered that it be added to the list of cases scheduled for a hearing in the near future.  That hearing is scheduled for January 8. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Top Italian influencer fined €1 million over cake deal
Body: Italy's competition watchdog on Friday fined two companies owned by the fashion entrepreneur and Instagram star Chiara Ferragni €1 million for "unfair commercial practices" over her endorsement of a cake marketed as raising money for charity. The pandoro cake "designed" by Ferragni for the food group Balocco went on sale in November 2022, purportedly to raise funds for the treatment of children with bone cancer in a hospital in Turin. In fact, Balocco had made a fixed-sum donation of €50,000 to the Regina Margherita Hospital months earlier, the competition authority said in a statement. The firms that manage Ferragni's activities, Fenice and TBS Crew, made more than €1 million in the deal "without paying anything" to the hospital, it said. Fenice was fined €400,000  and TBS Crew was fined €675,000. Balocco, based near Turin in northwest Italy, was fined €420,000. The authority accused the three companies "of having implemented an unfair commercial practice by publicising the 'Pandoro Pink Christmas', designed by Chiara Ferragni, implying to consumers that in buying it, they would contribute to a donation" to the hospital. The pandoro cost around 2.5 times a non-branded version, a markup that "contributed to misleading customers, reinforcing their perception of being able to contribute to the donation". Ferragni, who has almost 30 million followers on Instagram, came to prominence with a fashion blog before launching her shoe collection. She went on to collaborate with several fashion brands, including Dior and Chanel, and is part of one of Italy's most famous celebrity couples with her husband Fedez, a rapper and music producer.

Title: Government position for EU not to have competence on rape criticised
Body: The Malta Women’s Lobby is requesting the government to reconsider its stance on a proposed EU directive on violence against women. Malta Today reported on Thursday that, together with another 16 EU states, Malta is arguing against the European Union having competence on the prosecution of rape. In its statement, the lobby said that despite the well-documented vulnerability of women in society to gender-based and sexual violence, the Maltese government has chosen to support the removal of rape from a proposed EU directive on violence against women and domestic violence.  This decision, it said, stood at odds with established European legal norms. The directive establishes a consent-based definition of rape across the EU. “This approach aligns with the principles of the Istanbul Convention, an international treaty aimed at combating violence against women." Malta is a signatory of that convention, which had introduced no consent rape. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard told Malta Today that Malta's law was in line with the proposed directive but Malta was against allowing the EU to have competence on other aspects of national law by casting a wider obligation on other member states. The lobby argued that consent-based definition is vital, particularly given that 11 EU  states continue to predominantly define rape based on the use of force, threat, or coercion. Such definitions have proven to be inadequate in providing comprehensive protection to victims and have often resulted in secondary victimisation, it said. The lobby urged the government to heed the voices of women's organisations, legal associations, survivors, and the hundreds of thousands of citizens who have signed petitions in favour of a robust directive addressing violence against women. Legal experts emphasised that their stance is grounded in legal accuracy and further bolstered by the support of European lawyers, academics, and civil society organisations, including women's advocacy groups, it said. The lobby called on the government to advocate for the inclusion of rape in the proposed directive. Such a reconsideration would represent a significant stride towards the eradication of violence against women and the assurance of justice for victims. “Failure to do so would further highlight the fact that women’s rights are not high on the Maltese government’s agenda, not to mention the total disrespect towards and disregard for victims of rape,” the lobby charged.

Title: Mobsters nabbed while partying, shopping in Italy
Body: One of Italy's most dangerous fugitives has been captured at a party, Italian police said on Thursday, while another mobster was arrested while shopping in a supermarket. Gaetano Angrisano, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for drug trafficking 18 months ago and was on the interior ministry's "100 most dangerous fugitives" list, Naples police said. A powerful member of a clan in the notorious Scampia neighbourhood of the southern Italian city, he had been "a ghost" who "escaped handcuffs for a year and a half", it said. But after establishing he would be at a party in a social housing complex on Wednesday night, some 250 policemen surrounded the block so that "no-one could get in or out". "They flushed him out. Angrisano, who had been invited to a party, had to leave his friends and relatives just after the cake was cut," police said. Meanwhile, in Torvaianica, a coastal town just south of Rome, police nabbed a 52-year-old man who was sentenced in November to over 20 years in prison for mafia association and arms and drugs dealing. The man, from Lecce in the south-east of Italy, "was spotted in the Lazio region while shopping at a supermarket and was immediately arrested", police said on Thursday. He had been "a leading organised crime figure in (the southern region of) Salento in the first decade of the 2000s", it said.

Title: Who doughnut? Australian woman charged over Krispy Kreme truck theft
Body: An Australian woman was charged Thursday with stealing a parked truck stuffed with 10,000 Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  Police said the unmarked delivery truck had stopped for fuel on the outskirts of Sydney when a 28-year-old woman allegedly hopped inside and made off with the freshly baked booty.  Detectives followed a trail of crumbs to a suburban carpark, where they found the abandoned vehicle more than a week later.  The woman was arrested on Thursday, and police said her just desserts was to be charged with taking a truck without its owner's consent.  Police said the doughnuts were "destroyed".

Title: Australian police nab man over 17 million scam texts
Body: Australian police on Wednesday charged a man living in suburban Sydney with sending 17 million scam text messages, one for almost every adult in the country.  New South Wales police said the unnamed 39-year-old was single-handedly responsible for scam texts that have been plaguing mobile phone users across the country.  The texts included fake links purporting to be from Australia Post or toll road operators and were allegedly sent using "SIM boxes" that can send tens of thousands of messages per day. The man was charged with using networked equipment to "commit serious offence" and granted bail.  "SMS phishing is one of the most common tactics deployed by scammers to obtain banking and other personal information from a victim," said Jason Smith, commander of the police Cybercrime Squad.  "SIM boxes can hold over 250 active SIM cards and will typically send out up to 150,000 messages per day containing phishing lures to various scams."

Title: 'Culture of violence': youth crime spikes in Greece
Body: Katerina vividly recalls the day a younger boy from a nearby school pressed a knife to her friend's throat. Underage crime in Greece is on the rise, official data shows, presenting authorities with a challenge they have never faced at this level before. "He can't have been over 14 years old - my friend was cracking jokes, he didn't take him seriously at first," said the 16-year-old girl in the capital Athens, who asked to be interviewed under a false name. "That boy peeled off from a group of 20 kids and demanded my friend's cellphone," she said, recalling the event two years later. According to police figures, robbery with violence committed by minors aged 13 to 17 rose from 62 in 2000 to over 470 in 2020, while homicides more than doubled from seven to 16, and rapes increased fivefold from six to 32. With school brawls breaking out regularly, police minister Giannis Oikonomou was summoned to parliament on November 6 to address the issue. He said a "culture of violence" was growing among youths in Greece, with often "shocking" results. "It reflects a failure of family, of school, of society in general," Oikonomou said, adding that police had arrested around 1,300 youths for various crimes and misdemeanours in September. "It is particularly worrying that the average age of perpetrators is falling," Oikonomou said. Experts and officials blame factors including Greece's near-decade economic crisis, and the coronavirus lockdown, for the spread of youth alienation that countries such as Britain, France and Germany are already familiar with. France in 2020 recorded 357 youth gang incidents compared to 288 the previous year, and the interior ministry has identified 74 gangs around the country, 46 just in the Paris region. In Britain, the Children's Commissioner in 2019 estimated that 27,000 children in England alone identified as gang members. Germany, where nationwide figures are harder to come by, has also been shocked by teen killings in recent years. School bullying in Greece is also turning nastier and more frequent, with cases making headlines every week. A study in March supervised by the European Antibullying Network found that one in three Greek school children among nearly 3,000 polled had suffered bullying - mainly at the ages of 13 and 14, and primarily directed at girls, migrants and those from single-parent families. One in six also said they felt their school was not providing adequate instruction against bullying. Much of the violence goes unreported. "Nobody calls the police - you don't want to get in trouble," Katerina said. In June, eight minors were convicted of gang raping a 15-year-old boy in the western Athens district of Ilion. In September, a 16-year-old boy threw a lit flare into a classroom in Langadas, near Thessaloniki. And in November, three teenage girls were arrested for beating a classmate in a schoolyard in the Athens district of Peristeri.   In addition to the 2010-2018 economic crisis that shook the nation, Covid restrictions and the influence of social media are seen as key factors. "The economic crisis, and the pandemic crisis immediately afterwards, played a major role in children being closed off and feeling very uncomfortable without their friends," Nestor Courakis, a criminology expert and professor of law at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, told AFP. "The result is that they went online, with all that entails in terms of isolation, depression and negative influences," he said. "Youths have become more familiarised with violence." "But the situation is not out of control," Courakis insisted. Katerina's mother, who also declined to give her name, said the working-class Athens district where the family lives was hit hard by the economic crisis. "And teens experience economic hardship more than adults do," she said. She also blames the growing influence of trap, a subgenre of hip-hop featuring lyrics that detractors say promote violence and objectify women. "They play trap even at parties in our local primary school, for children younger than nine," she said. The government says it has doubled the number of psychologists and social workers at schools to 3,200, and a law passed in March foresees additional training to around 125,000 teachers nationwide.

Title: Canadian faces 14 murder charges for selling suicide kits
Body: A former Canadian chef accused of selling suicide kits that lead to deaths in several countries was charged Monday with 14 counts of murder related to suicides in Canada as a result of his online scheme. The charges filed against Kenneth Law, 58, are on top of 14 he already faces for allegedly "counselling or aiding" suicides across Ontario province, according to documents. His defense lawyer Matthew Gourlay also confirmed to AFP that Law has been charged with 14 new counts of second-degree murder. Law was arrested in May for marketing a substance that is used as a food additive but can kill if misused. He is said to have targeted vulnerable people online. He is believed to have sent as many as 1,200 packages to people in more than 40 countries since 2020. Toronto police are scheduled to brief the media on the new charges Tuesday. In Britain, at least 272 people purchased products from Law's websites and 88 of them died, police there have said.  Alerted by Interpol, several other countries have launched investigations, including New Zealand and Italy, where nine buyers have been identified and one victim has died. The Canadian victims were both male and female between the ages of 16 and 36, according to police. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Financial crime needs to be fought proportionately
Body: It is trite knowledge that, no matter the nature of the crime, the fundamental human rights of the person charged must be safeguarded. The application of criminal law necessarily goes hand in glove with the respect of fundamental human rights. Proportionality is the determining factor in the delicate balance between public interest on the one hand and the protection of human rights on the other. The lack of proportionality is one of the main causes for findings against member states of the Council of Europe by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Financial crime, despite the difficulties and complexities encountered by investigating bodies, and despite its often controversial nature, comes as no exception. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which was brought into force in 1994, has been amended no less than 27 times, more often than not to bring it in line with Malta’s international obligations. Many times, amendments were introduced fastidiously but, on a couple of occasions, an overzealous legislator lost sight of the principle of proportionality.   Our courts have made it abundantly clear that court orders freezing one’s assets are not intended as a form of anticipated punishment but solely to avoid the dissipation of those assets that could be subject to confiscation in the case of an eventual finding of guilt. The current situation in our procedural laws on financial crime does not reflect this cardinal principle. As things stand, one’s assets may be “attached”, without much scrutiny, for a whole year without charges being filed. The situation when a person is charged is even more serious since, upon a simple and unqualified request by a prosecuting officer, all that person’s property is “frozen” without the possibility of scrutiny by the courts. No investigation into the proportionality between the quantum of the proceeds of the crime alleged and the amount and nature of the property possessed by the person charged is made or can be made. All assets are frozen irrespective of whether they constitute the proceeds of crime or not. There have been cases where the prosecution insisted on the issuing of a freezing order when it was evident that there were no proceeds of crime. Our courts are the ultimate guardians of the safeguarding one’s fundamental human rights and, where more than one interpretation of a law is possible, the one safeguarding such rights should always take precedence. Draconian interpretations of draconian laws are a recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, in recent times, many of our courts have strangely made a dead letter of a crystal-clear provision of law intended to allow the modification of freezing orders. This provision, which actually doesn’t allow for much interpretation, was previously interpreted correctly. If a person is found guilty of a relevant offence, all his property is confiscated in favour of the State. The person found guilty would have to institute fresh civil proceedings to determine which property will be confiscated and which may be retained. This cumbersome remedy is not one against the freezing order but against the order of confiscation. Currently no remedy exists whereby, in the course of the habitual lengthy proceedings before the courts of criminal jurisdiction, the person charged may request the court to remove from the ambit of the freezing order property that was, for example, legally inherited through a public deed and has no connection to the crimes brought against him. The result is serious and unwarranted hardship including the closure of businesses and the cessation of professional activity even in the absence of any finding of guilt. This hardship necessarily extends to family members, co-owners of immovable property and employees who may face layoffs due to the lack of proportionality in the law. Malta must respect its international obligations in the fight against financial crime but it must also respect the fundamental human rights of persons. The European Court of Human Rights has stated that where an interference with one’s property has taken place, subject to the conditions provided for by the law and in the public interest, there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State. A fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. Our courts have, on several occasions, sent warning signals to the authorities that all is not well with the current law in this field. The bill currently before parliament to amend various laws relating to the proceeds of crime is a clear step in the right direction in that it safeguards all the tools for combatting financial crime while not losing sight of the fundamental principle of proportionality.

Title: Man who attacked a drunk clubber has jail term reduced
Body: A man who was involved in a fight with a drunk clubber outside a St Paul’s Bay club in 2020 has seen an appeals court shaving four years and four months off his prison sentence after declaring there was not enough evidence to prove it was he who stabbed the victim in the face. Judge Neville Camilleri said although the evidence was clear that he had inflicted slight injuries on the victim, with punches and kicks, there was no such evidence to prove he had seriously injured him. He was ruling in an appeal filed by three former bouncers who used to run security at a St Paul’s Bay club who were jailed after the first court had found them guilty of carrying out the savage attack on an African man outside the club. The victim was stabbed in the face during the incident.  Stepan Stankov, 35, from Bulgaria, had been sentenced to imprisonment for five years and four months. Yermakov Mykhailo, 33, from Ukraine, was jailed for a year for causing slight injury during the same incident, while Dorde Dudic, 29, from Serbia was jailed for 18 months for his part in the attack. Mykhailo and Stankov were additionally found guilty of working as security officers without a police licence. The court heard how the incident had taken place outside Babylon Club on February 16, 2020, at 5am. The incident was not racially motivated, the court was told. The accused blamed a fourth person who had fled the scene. The assault was captured on CCTV, which was exhibited in court.   On appeal, Mr Justice Camilleri said although the footage showed the scale of the assault, it was not clear who had stabbed the victim in the face. He concluded that the victim was hit by all three “and their behaviour clearly defeats their arguments as to how they tried to restrain the victim. “Whilst it is true that the victim kept on coming forward, it is also true he could have been restrained without using the degree of violence used. The victim was punched repeatedly and was also kicked. The bite he inflicted on one of the (bouncers) was clearly inflicted in self-defence,” the court ruled. While confirming the punishment meted to Mykhailo and Dudic, the court said that according to evidence, Stankov was employed as a barman and not a bouncer, so the first court should have given an appropriate punishment. Moreover, the prosecution had not proved to the level required at law that it was he who had inflicted the grievous injury.  He therefore reduced his jail term to one year. Inspector Clayton Camilleri prosecuted. Stankov was represented by lawyers Johann Debono, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, while lawyer Damien Degiorgio appeared for Dudic. Lawyer Johann Debono also appeared for Mykhailo. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Nurses’ union boss faces corruption, financial probe
Body: The nurses’ union boss is facing two separate investigations over his earnings as the amounts of money paid to him in overtime and on-call allowances have triggered suspicions over the hours claimed. Paul Pace, president of the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses (MUMN), is being investigated by the Permanent Commission Against Corruption and the police’s Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID), Times of Malta can confirm. While the FCID investigation has been ongoing since the end of summer, the corruption commission probe was opened a few weeks ago. Several government officials are being questioned in both investigations. In September, the Public Service Commission found Pace was paid more than he deserved for overtime he claimed to have worked at his full-time job. He was suspended from work for five days and ordered to refund the money. Pace insists the overpayment was simply a human error that amounted to just €215.  RELATED STORIES  But a parliamentary question in October revealed he may have claimed far more hours of overtime than he could have possibly worked, government sources told Times of Malta. Pace’s “suspicious” earnings were revealed in a reply Health Minister Chris Fearne gave to PN MP Albert Buttigieg. Fearne tabled in parliament the amounts paid to Pace in overtime and on-call allowances every year since 2012. The amounts reveal that over several years, Pace appeared to have clocked an “exorbitant” number of hours at his full-time job as a charge nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital. In 2022, for example, he was paid €21,387 for overtime work, which equates to an average of €411 per week. During the same year he was paid €10,861 in on-call allowances on the same job, which means an average of €208 a week. Added to the normal hours of his normal duty roster, the total number of hours he claimed to have worked for or at Mount Carmel Hospital last year is far more than he could possibly have, government sources said. The pattern seems to have been repeated throughout several other years. The suspicion over the generous number of hours Pace claims to have spent on his full-time job was further heightened as sources insist he works at the MUMN offices or on union matters on most days while also doing work as a member of the MCESD and while presiding over meetings of the Maltese unions forum – For.U.M. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2019 Pace was also employed as a consultant for then-health minister Konrad Mizzi – a contract which paid him €15,000 annually for 15 hours of work every week. In the contract he also agreed to a clause binding him to work beyond those hours if need be. Although he had left the MUMN during that period, he still clocked an average of €17,000 worth of overtime hours and €9,000 worth of on-call hours every year at his Mount Carmel full-time job. Pace could not be reached for comment and Times of Malta was unable to confirm how many hours he claimed to have worked on his full-time job in total.

Title: Court rejects AG appeal on 2005 haul of 15 million contraband cigarettes
Body: A judge has rejected an appeal filed by the attorney general over a criminal case related to a 2005 haul of 15 million contraband cigarettes found hidden in a container at Malta Freeport. Mr Justice Neville Camilleri rubbished arguments by the attorney general that father and son Arthur and Aaron Ciancio, both from Mellieħa, should have been given a harsher sentence and should have been both found guilty of the charges brought against them. Both were accused of involvement in the racket, which resulted in the massive haul of smuggled cigarettes. The merchandise was worth some €593,000 and was liable to €1.5 million in excise duty and a further €377,000 in VAT. In 2017, after a 12-year-long court process, the court found that the prosecution had not proved Arthur Ciancio’s alleged involvement and conspiracy in the illegal importation of the tobacco products. It, however, convicted him of forgery, falsification of documents and making use of false documents, sentencing him to a jail term of two years, suspended for four years. As for Aaron Ciancio, the court observed that the prosecution had failed to prove its charges, adding that the fact that he was the son of the other accused and lived in the same house did not mean he was guilty. “It brought not one piece of evidence in regard to Aaron Ciancio that he was in any way involved in the crime,” the court had concluded. An anonymous tip-off had alerted the police to the imminent arrival of the merchandise, which was eventually seized by customs officers on Easter Saturday in March 2005.   The relative bills of lading of two containers described them as carrying promotional toys and giftware respectively for two Maltese companies which, upon subsequent investigations, turned out to be non-existent. The first container yielded 421 master cases, each containing 10,000 Regal brand cigarettes. The second turned out to contain 726 cases of contraband merchandise. The attorney general argued that Aaron Ciancio should have been convicted of fraud and falsification of documents and that his father should have also been found guilty of his involvement in the importation of the shipment. The fact that there was a last-minute change of destination of the container in question did not change the intent to commit this crime. But Mr Justice Camilleri threw these arguments out of the window. When containers arrive in Malta for transshipment purposes, it means the merchandise is not destined for Malta and that no taxes are due in Malta. The court said evidence showed Aaron Ciancio was uninterested in his father’s business even though he occasionally helped him out. Mr Justice Camilleri, therefore, rejected the attorney general’s appeal and confirmed the judgment of the first court in its entirety, also throwing out Arthur Ciancio’s appeal that most of the evidence was hearsay and should not have been considered admissible evidence in court. Lawyer Kathleen Calleja Grima was counsel to Arthur Ciancio and lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were counsel to Aaron Ciancio.

Title: Police arrest man following string of thefts in Valletta and Sliema
Body: The police on Thursday arrested a 21-year-old man following a string of thefts in Sliema and Valletta on Wednesday. The police said they were on Wednesday at around 9pm informed that a man armed with a knife had entered a shop in Sir Adrian Dingli Street, Sliema and demanded cash from the salesperson, a 37-year-old man who lives in St Paul’s Bay. The thief escaped with cash and other items he stole from the shop. The man is believed to be the same person who, earlier in the day, carried out another two thefts in Sliema and one in Valletta. The first theft was carried out at around 2am when the thief entered a hotel in Old Bakery Street Valletta and stole cash. At around 4am, he made off with cash from a hostel in Triq Sir George Borg, Sliema. The case was in a box behind the reception bench. Soon after, he stole a wallet and a mobile phone from a car in Triq it-Torri,  also in Sliema. Following a number of searches at places the man was known to visit, the police found him in Valletta on Thursday morning and arrested him. Investigations are continuing. The man is expected to be charged in the coming days. An inquiry is being held. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Hip-hop mogul Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs again accused of rape
Body: A fourth woman has publicly accused music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs of sexual assault, alleging he and others gang-raped her when she was 17, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday. The filing says Combs – an artist and producer also known as Puff Daddy – met the unnamed woman in 2003 after his associate Harve Pierre singled her out at a lounge in Detroit and convinced her to take a private jet to New York to meet the rapper. Prior to taking the flight, Pierre forced the then 17-year-old to perform oral sex on him before taking her across state lines to Combs’ studio. There, the group of men including Combs plied her with drugs and alcohol before violently raping her repeatedly, the civil suit filed in a federal court in New York alleges. Her lawyer Douglas Wigdor – who also represented R&B singer Cassie, the first woman to publicly come forward against Combs – said that “the depravity of these abhorrent acts has, not surprisingly, scarred our client for life”. It is the fourth lawsuit levelled against Combs alleging similar abuse and rape. The first, from Cassie, was settled two days after it was filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act, a law that opened a one-year window for sexual assault claims to be filed that otherwise happened too long ago to litigate. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations against him. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on Wednesday’s filing. Following Cassie’s lawsuit, plaintiff Joi Dickerson-Neal alleged she had been “drugged, sexually assaulted and abused” in 1992 by the rapper and that he had filmed and distributed the acts as “revenge porn”. Another complaint filed anonymously accuses Combs and music collaborator Aaron Hall of raping her. In recent weeks, an additional lawsuit accused Pierre of abusing his position atop Combs’ label to groom and sexually assault his former assistant. The suit says Combs’ company, Bad Boy Entertainment, looked the other way. Combs, 54, founded Bad Boy in 1993, and was a major figure in hip-hop’s commercialisation over the course of the decades that followed. His proteges included the late Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige. He is among hip-hop’s billionaires, not least due to his ventures in the liquor industry. The recent lawsuits against him describe Combs as a violent man who used his celebrity to prey on and intimidate women.

Title: Three killed in Las Vegas university shooting
Body: Three people were killed and another seriously injured by a gunman who was shot dead by police at a US university on Wednesday. The incident at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a short distance from the gambling hub's tourist-packed Strip, was the latest in the United States, where gun violence is a part of the fabric of daily life. "Three of the victims are confirmed deceased," Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told a press conference. He said a fourth victim had been critically injured by the shooting but that condition later upgraded to stable. The identity of the shooter was not immediately released, but CNN and the Los Angeles Times, quoting law enforcement sources, said he was a 67-year-old career college professor with links to schools in Georgia and North Carolina. But it was not clear what affiliation he had with the Nevada university where the shooting took place. US President Joe Biden in a statement decried the latest "horrific act of gun violence" to terrorize a college campus. Police responded within minutes to reports of an active shooter at 11:45 am (1945 GMT), McMahill told a press conference. Two officers "immediately engaged the suspect in a shootout" and the suspect "was struck and is deceased at this time," said university police chief Adam Garcia. The incident began as an outdoor gathering of students was taking place. "Students were playing games and eating food, there were tables set up for them to build Legos," said McMahill. "If it hadn't been for the heroic actions of one of those police officers who responded, there could have been countless additional lives taken." Police did not provide any further information on the identities of the victims or gunman, and are in the process of notifying next-of-kin. One woman told local broadcaster KVVU that she had heard a series of loud noises and fled into a building on the campus, from which she was later evacuated by police. "I was just having breakfast and then I heard three, like, loud booms," she told the station. "Then two more, and then police showed up there and ran inside... but then after two minutes boom, boom, boom, more shots. So I ran into a basement, and then we were in the basement for 20 minutes." Officers were continuing to search the campus, which will remain closed through Friday, but "there is no more ongoing threat to our community," the sheriff said. Las Vegas is a gambling and entertainment hub that attracts millions of visitors every year, many of whom come to see large, high-profile events. Last month, the city played host to its inaugural Formula One Grand Prix. It is currently hosting basketball's NBA Cup at the T-Mobile arena, just two miles (three kilometers) away from the scene of the shooting. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James sent condolences to affected families during a press conference Wednesday, in which he also voiced anger about the grim regularity of mass shootings. "It makes no sense that we continue to lose innocent lives, on campuses, schools, at shopping markets and movie theaters and all type of stuff. It's ridiculous," he said. Mass shootings are common in the United States, a country where there are more guns than people, and where attempts to clamp down on their spread are always met with stiff resistance. The country has recorded over 600 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nongovernmental organization that defines a mass shooting as four or more people wounded or killed. The Washington Post, which keeps its own tally of mass shootings, said that as of Monday, there had been 38 such incidents in which at least four people had been killed. Las Vegas was the scene of one of America's deadliest-ever mass shootings, when a gunman opened fire on a crowded music festival in 2017, killing 60 people. Efforts to tighten gun controls have for years run up against opposition from Republicans, staunch defenders of what they interpret as an unfettered constitutional right to weaponry. The political paralysis endures despite widespread outrage over recurrent shootings. "This is not normal, and we can never let it become normal," said Biden. "For all the action we have taken since I've been President, the epidemic of gun violence we face demands that we do even more. But we cannot do more without Congress."

Title: Man jailed for sexually abusing underage Paceville clubber
Body: A man has been jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to sexually abusing an underage girl in a Paceville nightclub while holidaying in Malta two years ago. Lionel Seux, 51, from France, had a change of heart and pleaded guilty to committing the acts in September 2021. According to evidence that emerged in court during the compilation of evidence, Seux accompanied a 16-year-old girl to the nightclub’s bathroom at around 1am on September 20. Once inside, he locked the door, undressed her and then himself and, subsequently, proceeded to touch her and himself inappropriately. The court heard it was only the incessant banging on the door by the girl’s friend that stopped the accused from doing anything else. After the prosecution rested its case, Seux decided to plead guilty to all the charges brought against him. He was given a chance to reconsider his guilty plea after being warned that the crimes he had committed carry a maximum of nine years in jail. He confirmed his admission when he appeared before Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit. He was convicted of non-consensual sexual advances with a minor and of holding the girl against her will since he locked the bathroom door and did not let her leave. The magistrate said that although he had admitted to the charges, the stage when he filed the admission was late in the proceedings, after the prosecution had brought all its witnesses. He, therefore, could not benefit from the full reduction in punishment as those who file an early guilty plea. The magistrate sentenced Seux to five years and four months in prison and ordered that the time he spent in preventive custody be reduced from the jail time. He was also ordered to pay just under €5,100 in court expenses related to the appointment of court experts. Police inspectors John Spiteri and Leeroy Balzan Engerer prosecuted.

Title: Binance founder agrees to plead guilty to money laundering
Body: Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, is expected to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion (€3.9 billion) and its chief is planning to step down, a US media report said Tuesday. In a deal with US authorities that could allow the company to keep running, Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao intends to plead guilty to violating US anti-money laundering rules and leave his position, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. The agreement would end most of the investigations into Binance, which was created in 2017 and cornered much of the crypto-trading market, turning Zhao into a billionaire. Binance runs crypto exchanges and provides other services across the world, but it has taken a severe hit since crypto markets collapsed and regulators began probing the legality of its business. Zhao, who has often been presented as the archrival of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was due in court Tuesday to enter his plea, the Journal report added. The agreement with authorities would also let Zhao keep his majority ownership in Binance.  He is expected to face sentencing at a later time. For now, executives have left the company and it has laid off staff this year as it grappled with probes in the United States. The Justice Department, whose investigation looked into Binance's program to find and prevent money laundering, declined to comment. The Journal added that the Justice Department had also looked into whether Binance allowed people in sanctioned countries -- such as Iran and Russia -- to trade with Americans. Binance did not respond to media queries on the matter. The $4.3 billion in fines reportedly include sums to address a civil lawsuit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and claims leveled by the Treasury Department's agencies. But this deal does not include a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), another regulator. The SEC pressed a raft of charges against Binance in June, saying it allowed US residents to trade even when it was not registered in the country as a securities exchange. The case also alleged the firm misused customer funds. While Binance was founded in China, Zhao moved its operations to other locations internationally after a crackdown on the crypto sector by Beijing. The volatile industry surged in 2021 with a range of complex products and celebrity endorsements propelling it to a valuation in excess of $3 trillion last year. But a series of scandals including the collapse of the FTX exchange and criminal charges for its executives saw public confidence evaporate and investors pull their money out. In July 2021, the Malta Financial Services Authority warned that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume is not authorised to operate under Maltese law. It had issued a similar notice in February 2020. Back in 2018, Binance served as the jewel in the government’s push for Malta to be crowned the world’s "Blockchain Island". It had received a welcome by then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who said at the time that Malta wanted to be “the global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses”.   .

Title: Legal definition of 'domestic violence' to be updated
Body: The government will next year present a bill to amend the definition of domestic violence in the law to make it less broad, the Domestic Violence Commissioner said on Tuesday evening.  Updating the definition is one of the recommendations made by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia in the inquiry into the femicide of Bernice Cassar.  The inquiry concluded that the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother-of-two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.  Cassar was murdered while driving to work. Her estranged husband Roderick Cassar has been charged with the femicide and is pleading not guilty. Samantha Pace Gasan was speaking to journalists on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the murder of Cassar.  Alongside Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Parliamentary Secretary for Equality and Reforms Rebecca Buttigieg, Pace Gasan gave details on the progress and work on improving the current systems to fight against domestic violence and taking on the inquiry’s recommendations.  One of Valenzia's recommendations is to update the definition of domestic violence in the law since it is too broad and leads to a caseload increase. Currently, violence committed by anyone living in the same home, including flatmates, is considered a case of domestic violence.  Pace Gasan said that a bill to update the law would be submitted to parliament and that discussions among stakeholders would take place to ensure the definition is correct and leaves no victims out.   RELATED STORIES  On his part, Minister Camilleri said that more than 70 percent of the recommendations that emerged from the inquiry have been implemented.  “A  number of recommendations have been implemented this year, others are in the process of being implemented. It is a priority that not one recommendation is left out,” he said. One of the recommendations was to increase resources within the police’s domestic violence unit.  While Pace Gasan said the shortage of human resources is a constant issue faced, she said that in recent months 25 officers joined the police Domestic Violence Unit.  Now there are more than 60 people in the department.  From January, ‘special time’ will be allocated in court to analyse more urgent domestic violence cases.  The inquiry also pointed out that the risk assessment tools used to determine the level of danger a particular domestic violence victim faces must be fixed or changed.  The tool, known as the DASH system- Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification – has faced criticism ever since it was introduced in Malta in 2018.  Pace Gasan said last month that studies to change the risk assessment tool were concluded and that the Danger Assessment (DA) tool will be implemented. She said the tool is currently being adapted to suit the Maltese situation.  She said there are now two magistrates focusing on domestic violence cases, and that a new specialised team dedicated to evaluating high-risk domestic violence cases has been set up earlier this year.  Regarding establishing domestic violence hubs with teams specialising in the field, the commissioner said that the Santa Luċija hub will be operating by the end of the year.  Another hub in Mtarfa will be operating next year.  Camilleri clarified that the domestic violence hubs will allow the unit to move out of the police headquarters and operate from the centre. The alleged aggressors will not be allowed into the hubs, but only victims and children.  He also said that the government will provide wearable panic alarms for victims of domestic violence. Once pressed, the panic alarm will call 112 and automatically give the person’s location to emergency services. Electronic tagging will be introduced next year. In the coming days, the third strategy on domestic violence and gender-based violence will be launched, which will be a ‘roadmap’ for the next five years on how to tackle domestic violence.  Regarding a new law allowing people to check whether their partner has a history of domestic violence, Pace Gasan said the Victim Support Agency recorded seven requests.

Title: Let's do everything possible to prevent violence against women - Roberta Metsola
Body: European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Monday called for “proper protection frameworks” as she spoke about violence against women during Monday’s parliamentary sitting. Speaking on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Metsola called for commitment to “do everything possible to prevent violence against women and girls in Europe and beyond”.   Metsola referred to Bernice Cassar and Paulina Dembska’s murders in Malta, along with those of Giulia Cecchettin, Ashling Murphy and others giving them as “examples of abuse and murder of women in Europe... simply for being women. It is appalling. It is terrible. And it is completely unacceptable.” She said: “We need proper protection frameworks. We need more convictions of those who prey on females. And we need to end the remaining institutional blindness to this epidemic upon women. There are no more excuses. It is already too late.” Metsola said that nowords of comfort can ever bring a mother, a daughter, or a sister back. But justice and accountability were small steps for those they leave behind. “We must do more for women.”   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: ‘We want to know that our sister has not died in vain’
Body: One year after the state failed to protect femicide victim Bernice Cassar, her family have yet to receive an apology for the various shortcomings that left her two children motherless. Speaking up for the first time since the murder, Bernice’s two brothers and two sisters came together to voice the family’s disappointment. They also spoke about how life has been since November 22, 2022, when their eldest sister was shot dead on her way to work. Her estranged husband, Roderick Cassar, has been charged with the femicide and is pleading not guilty. “Our sister exposed every single loophole in the system. She was begging the authorities to protect her, but no one listened. We can’t believe they did not see the risk that was so obvious to anyone around her,” said her sister Alessia Cilia Portelli. Bernice had filed multiple police reports against her ex-husband before she was shot dead. Days before she was killed, her lawyer pleaded with police to take action against her ex-husband for breaching a protection order.    An inquiry concluded that the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother-of-two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload. The inquiry went on to make a number of recommendations that include increasing resources and strengthening protection orders. A copy of the recommendations was given to the family’s lawyers just a few hours before the press conference was announced.  RELATED STORIES  “No one has kept us informed about what happened to those recommendations,” said her brother Peter Cilia. “We can’t bring our sister back. But we want to know she did not die in vain. That at least this will not happen again. They said the system failed her. But what about the people in that system? Has something been done?” he said while acknowledging that, since his sister’s murder, police did take reports more seriously. The last photo The four siblings – Alessia, Peter, Clarice Micallef Cilia and Karsten Cilia Zarb – sit around the dining table at Karsten’s house. It was the last place they were together as a family, a Halloween costume party for the children two weeks before the murder. That day Bernice looked happy. “My well became famous. Bernice wanted to take a new profile photo,” Karsten says sombrely as he points towards a stone well in the hallway of his home. The scene is familiar. It is the backdrop to the photo of Bernice used in the media following the murder.   Alessia continues: “It was her homework from the therapist. Her old profile picture was with the kids and the therapist was working on helping her to accept that she was more than a mother – she was a woman. That day she was determined to take the photo.” Alessia has other versions of the photo taken with her mobile phone. “Now that photo is on her grave,” Karsten says poignantly. It remained a symbol of Bernice trying to claim her independence.   “That day we remember her happy. After that, the last nine days of her life were hard and filled with suffering. “The timeline is known and we won’t go into it. But in those nine days she was fighting for her life. She filed a report and knew there was a protection order. She noticed that the protection order was just a piece of paper with no value. She felt alone. She was scared. This is something we are angry about,” Alessia says. Living with loss “We, her family, are carrying the weight of all this. Her children especially,” she adds. “The pain is shared, but from a different perspective. Our parents’ loss is one thing and that of her children is the hardest. “You learn to live differently. The pain is there. Not a day passes without it. There are moments when you feel happy – like when Clarice got married – but there is a bittersweet feeling that is with you all day,” Alessia says. She recalls that, the night before the murder, she was on the phone with Bernice. “She was washing the children and crying a lot. She was feeling helpless and did not like living in fear. She was worried about the safety of her children too… The last thing she did was kiss the kids and see them onto the school van. Then she drove towards her death.”   Clarice recalls the morning of the murder. “Bernice’s daughter was going to be Our Lady in the school pageant and Bernice needed to pick up a costume from Birkirkara that day. She was busy so I offered to go. After what happened I ended up not going… After that, her daughter did not want to be Our Lady. She wanted to be an angel – like her mother had become.” As she wipes her tears, she says this year has been a difficult one for everyone.  The children are aware of what happened. On the day of the murder they were informed by their school therapists and other professionals, with a family member to provide support in such a sensitive and difficult situation. Hoping for closure Alessia, Peter, Karsten and Clarice have now stepped in to share the parenting role. The children, now age nine and six, live with their grandparents – where they were already living before the murder as Bernice had left the matrimonial home some months earlier. Their aunties and uncles chip in to take them to extracurricular activities, help with the homework, take them to school parties and to therapy.   “They are happy children,” Alessia says. Then she stops. “No words seem right. ‘Happy’ in the sense that they have all the material things they need and are surrounded by love. They smile and they are doing well at school. But they miss their mother. They visit her at the cemetery and take her the pictures and crafts they make for her.” The siblings, and other family members, also make sure someone is always present during the court proceedings. The compilation of evidence is reaching its final stages. While they understand that the court system needs to take time, they hope for closure. “We want justice – holistically. Those who failed our sister should take responsibility. We want to live in peace knowing that we and the children are safe,” they say. They are now preparing for Christmas. “Last Christmas was too close to the case. We can’t use it as a gauge to how this one will be. Bernice loved Christmas. After she died, she received a parcel at work. She had bought our Christmas presents,” says Alessia. Clarice, emotional, adds: “We had to figure out whose was whose. They were our birth stones. We treasure the last gift she gave us – after she died.” The family is organising a tribute gathering called Echoes of Silence in remembrance of Bernice Cassar on November 22 at Triq il-Baċir, Paola, from 7.30am to 8.30am: one year to the date and place of her murder.

Title: Copper cable thieves caught red-handed after leaving hundreds with no internet
Body: A Marsascala man was caught red-handed attempting to steal underground copper cables in the early hours of Saturday morning, with police also arresting two suspected accomplices. The suspects are believed to have cut through a fibre optic cable in their attempt to steal the copper, cutting off internet connectivity for GO Internet customers in Valletta and Floriana in the process. Police said in a statement that they were called to an area close to Argotti Gardens at around 4am after receiving a report about an attempted theft of copper cables. Officers entered tunnels in the area and spotted a man, who is 39 and from Marsascala, carrying copper cables. He tried to hide but eventually emerged and gave himself up. The police officers continued to search inside the tunnels and eventually came across two other men hiding: a 30-year-old Żejtun man and a 35-year-old Nigerian national. All three were arrested and taken to the Valletta police station for further questioning. They are likely to be arraigned later on Saturday. The attempted robbery had a knock-on effect on hundreds of residents, with GO customers in Valletta and Floriana left without internet as a result. In a company statement, GO said that its technicians had been onsite since 2am and had alerted the police after discovering the cut cable. Technicians could only begin work to repair the cable once police forensic teams had completed their assessments. ‘It is extremely disappointing and disheartening that such incidents keep on occurring. This is not the first time that our services have been impacted due to theft attempts. These individuals do not realise that they are tampering with critical infrastructure that supports civil protection units and other services, on which the country and its people depend,’ a GO spokesperson said. The spokesperson asked for customers’ patience and understanding while technicians worked to restore service. “Our teams are on site and are doing everything they possibly can to restore the services in as short as time as is reasonably possible. Services will start to be restored in the coming hours.”   "It is also extremely frustrating for us too since our resources need to be reallocated to fixing this unanticipated and deliberate damage instead of focusing our efforts on servicing our customers, and the country, not to mention the significant costs to repair which could have been invested elsewhere," the spokesperson said.

Title: Sweden's Supreme Court throws out 'vagina' ruling
Body: Warning: Graphic content Sweden's Supreme Court on Friday threw out an appeals court ruling acquitting a man of raping a 10-year-old girl because it had been unsure what the word she used for her vagina meant. The girl had used the word "snippa", devised by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) in the early 2000s and introduced in preschools as a neutral and informal term to destigmatise women's genitals. It is intended to be the female equivalent of the existing and commonly-used word "snopp" for male genitalia, and has rapidly grown in usage since its introduction. In June 2021, the Halmstad district court in southwestern Sweden convicted the man, who is in his 50s but has not been publicly named, of rape for putting his hand inside the girl's pants and touching her vagina. But a panel of appeals court judges overturned the ruling in February 2023, saying they could not conclude with certainty what the girl was referring to because she used the word "snippa". The dictionary defines "snippa" as the outer part of female genitalia but in common usage it refers to the entire vagina, not just the vulva. Despite the girl testifying that the man's fingers had been "inside" her "snippa", the appeals court also said it could not conclude that the man had penetrated her vagina because of the use of the word "snippa". Penetration is required for a rape conviction. The appeals court ruling caused an uproar among legal experts, health authorities and the public, prompting several demonstrations across Sweden, with the hashtag #jagvetvadensnippaar ("I know what a snippa is") going viral on social media. The Supreme Court ordered a new panel of appeals court judges to retry the case. "The court is not bound by the criminal classifications presented by the prosecutor but by the prosecutor's description of the act," the Supreme Court said. "In the snippa case, the Court of Appeal found it was proven that the man had touched the girl's sexual organs, and the court should therefore have looked at alternative classifications," it said. "It must have been clear to the Court of Appeal that there was another penalty provision that could have been applicable - sexual abuse of a child," wrote Stefan Johansson, one of the judges who participated in the Supreme Court's decision. The girl's mother welcomed the ruling, writing in a text message to Swedish Television: "A big weight has been lifted." The ruling was "important for children's right to the rule of law, and ... for my daughter's emotional well-being and faith in the rule of law".

Title: 'Child soldiers' and blood feuds: Sweden's out-of-control gang wars
Body: One night in September, teacher Thomas Cervin was woken by gunshots in his apartment building in Uppsala. His neighbour had just become the latest target in Sweden's terrifying gang wars. Execution-style shootings carried out by "child soldiers", apartment buildings rocked by bombings, innocent relatives targeted in vendettas, and the morning news summarising the night's death toll - all have become disturbingly routine in the normally quiet country. "No other country in Europe is seeing anything like this," said Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson as he vowed to defeat the gangs.    "Swedish legislation was not designed for gang wars and child soldiers. But we're changing that now," he said.  Sweden's gang wars have smouldered for a decade over control of the drugs market. But they took a drastic turn early this year when an internal feud led to gang members' families and loved ones also becoming targets. The September 13 shooting in Cervin's building in Uppsala, 70 kilometres north of Stockholm, was aimed at the mother-in-law of Rawa Majid, the "Kurdish Fox", and head of the notorious Foxtrot gang. She escaped unharmed.  "I had no idea she was related to him," Cervin said. "That's what makes so many people scared - the people involved have friends and relatives all over the place." "This new generation (of criminals) is ruthless," said Garip Gunes, who started a youth football team to keep kids in the disadvantaged Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby out of trouble. "Many parents are worried about their kids and don't let them go out except to go to school or football practice. They're worried they'll end up in the line of fire," he told AFP.  Criminology professor Felipe Estrada Dorner of Stockholm University told AFP the situation "has gotten totally out of control: they've started attacking loved ones and those who have nothing to do with these conflicts." "This is a big change from the violence that has prevailed until now." Forty-seven people have been killed in 314 shootings so far this year, police said, compared to only seven deaths in 2016. The victims and the perpetrators are increasingly young. Police last year investigated 336 15- to 17-year-olds for having illegal firearms, eight times more than a decade ago, the National Council for Crime Prevention said this month. Gangs now recruit kids to carry out contract killings - some younger than 15 - knowing they can't be jailed. "Children are contacting criminal gangs" offering to commit murders, Sweden's police chief Anders Thornberg said. These children "just don't know how to handle these weapons", Estrada Dorner said, often leading to innocent bystanders being wounded or killed. In Gottsunda, a suburb near Uppsala, Ebtesam Abowarrad agreed, and said people were scared. "The difference nowadays is that they shoot all over the place." "I never see anyone out in the streets anymore," the 40-year-old mother told AFP. Most young gang members have been on social services' radar for years, said Evin Cetin, a former lawyer who has written a book of interviews with young gang members, "Mitt ibland oss" (In Our Midst). "These kids have been trained by criminals -- they live, eat and breathe a culture of violence," she said. "Most of those I've met have an empty look in their eyes, they don't value their own lives." Prime Minister Kristersson has blamed the rise in organised crime on "naivety" over immigration. "An irresponsible immigration policy and failed integration led us here," the conservative leader said. But Cetin argued that the integration problem has a lot to do with the segregation immigrant communities face. "How is it possible that young Swedes in one of the richest countries in the world have gotten to the point where they're willing to kill, and kill their best friend to boot?" she asked. "It says a lot about segregation, the conditions in which they grow up and the exclusion they experience." Sakariya Hirsi, 26, who hails from Tensta, a heavily-immigrant suburb north of Stockholm, has seen several of his friends die in the violence. In 2020, he founded the Kollektiv Sorg group (Collective Grief) to help families cope with their loss and lobby for change. At a recent meeting of the group at a church in the suburb of Botkyrka, Alexander Zadruzny, 23, said he's "lost count" of how many of his friends have died. "I used to say that our kids grow up too fast, but... our kids don't even live long enough to become adults."  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Bail for allegedly raping 17-year-old ex-girlfriend, crime filmed on mobile
Body: A man accused of raping his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend was granted bail on Thursday, along with three other youths accused of attacking the girl's 16-year-old male friend.  A fifth member of the alleged gang had previously admitted to charges of grievously injuring the 16-year-old when he was arraigned in July and sentenced to a one-year jail term suspended for three years.  In July, the prosecution said the two minors had turned up at the police domestic violence unit on a Monday morning, claiming to have been assaulted at the Gianpula nightclub by a gang of Belgian youths the Saturday before. The victims told the police they were then taken to a flat in Sliema where the 17-year-old said she was raped by her ex-boyfriend, 20-year-old Dany Masuekama Kabangu.  In the meantime, in an ordeal that lasted from 5am to 1pm on that Sunday, the boy said he was beaten and assaulted by Kamangu Lema Lelo Arnaud, 18, and Muogo Mukengerwa N’Domba Amani, 20, and two other 17-year-old boys.  All four have pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Proceedings against them continued on Thursday, with Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo upholding a fresh request for bail for all four of the accused.  They were granted bail against a deposit of €15,000, a personal guarantee of €50,000 each as well as daily signing of the bail book and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am. The court previously heard how the girl and her Swiss friend were in Malta studying English, when she was contacted by her ex, whom she had met on the island.  The two had met up in hopes of rekindling their relationship, but the girl broke things off when she learned that Masuekama Kabangu was staying in a flat with four of his friends and his new girlfriend. On that Saturday evening, after a night at the nightclub, he convinced the girl to come back with him to Sliema, with the girl saying she was plied with vodka throughout the taxi ride to his flat.  The next thing she remembered was waking up naked in her ex’s flat to find him raping her.  She also realised that other people in the room were filming the alleged sexual assault.  The girl’s Swiss friend also told police that he was beaten by the Belgians outside Gianpula, who forced him to get into the same taxi with them. He said one of the accused had taken his phone and tried to buy a €2,000 Louis Vuitton bag, giving his Brussels address for its delivery.  Police apprehended the five youths at the airport just an hour before their flight was set to leave Malta, identifying them from photographs sent to them by the victim.  AG lawyers Cynthia Tomasuolo and Joseph Camilleri Azarov are prosecuting together with Inspectors John Spiteri, Omar Zammit and Jonathan Cassar. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Franco Debono, Stefano Filletti, Jason Azzopardi, Matthew Xuereb and Gianluca Cappitta are defence counsel.

Title: Works to start soon on three new halls for the criminal court
Body: The Justice Ministry has issued an artist's impression of new halls for the criminal court which will be housed in a renovated building that will also feature administrative offices and a "protective" space for victims and their relatives. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard announced on Monday that the three new courtrooms will be housed in the building known as 'Tal-Ferjol', just behind the main courthouse.    The renovated building will also house the criminal court's registry and an "innovative concept for Malta" - a specialised zone for victims. "This area will be only accessible to victims and will have a separate entrance to ensure their best possible protection," Attard said.   The €5 million project has been in the pipeline for quite a while. When it was first announced in 2020, then-justice minister Edward Zammit Lewis had promised it would be operational by this year. He had said at the time that the building would be turned into four courtrooms and 25 administrative offices. On Monday Attard acknowledged the project had been touted for several years but he said it could not be completed due to proceedings that had been at an impasse. The impasse has now been broken and a tender for the works will be issued in the coming days. He did not say when the project will be completed.   During the press conference Attard listed measures, initiatives and projects that have been completed or are in the works to mitigate the justice system's increasing challenges caused by staff shortages, the case waiting list and pending magisterial inquiries.   The government, he said, had allocated record funding for the courts and the justice system. With just over €60 million allocated to it, the Justice Ministry would next year see a 21 per cent increase over last year's allocated funds and almost four times the budget allocated to it during the last Nationalist administration in 2013, he said. The aim was to continue the journey towards a more efficient and reliable justice system.   He said a new courtroom in the family court building had been completed and works were underway on new offices and another courtroom for trials by jury. And the court's main entrance would soon house a new help desk. The Court Services Agency would also enjoy a budget that is three times as generous as it had in 2012. Its 500 employees, the highest number ever, are also enjoying better working conditions thanks to a recently signed collective agreement.   The minister also pointed out that judges and magistrates have added help. 29 full-time court attorneys now help them with court processes and the drafting of judgments, and the number of judicial assistants has doubled to 47 since 2012.

Title: Temping agent in Malta charged with conning 280 foreign workers
Body: A temping agent has been charged in court after allegedly conning about 280 third-country nationals into paying for a work contract in Malta which never materialised. Immigration police pressed charges against Jonathan James Borg, 42, from Balzan as the suspect behind the racket through which the mainly Indian foreign workers entered Malta lured by promises of a job and accommodation. Their hopes vanished once they reached their destination.  Matters came to a head when Borg’s boss at the company where he worked as an accountant began to receive calls from total strangers complaining that he had not kept his promise to provide them with a job and adequate accommodation in Malta. Police investigations revealed that the third-country nationals had arrived in Malta on the strength of false travel and employment documents.  Those documents were traced to Borg.  Each of the migrants allegedly paid some €4,000 only to end up with no job and nowhere to go.  Borg pleaded not guilty to being involved in a human trafficking conspiracy for personal gain, assisting foreign workers to enter Malta in breach of immigration laws, unauthorised use of electronic data, tampering with such data, software or documentation as well as document fraud.  He was also charged with breaching an attachment order issued in terms of anti-money laundering legislation and with allegedly committing these offences while under two suspended sentences handed down in 2019. He was further charged with relapsing.  He pleaded not guilty.  The prosecution objected to a request for bail because civilian witnesses are still to testify and the accused breached previous court orders.  The prosecution also pointed out that tracking down the accused’s address had delayed investigations. In a previous case, Borg had cited his parents’ address.  But it was obvious that he did not live there. His actual address was tracked down by the police through a food delivery app.  Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, turned down the request for bail, deeming the accused not sufficiently trustworthy and also because several witnesses were still to testify.  The court upheld a request for a freezing order over all assets of the accused.  AG lawyer Nathaniel Falzon and Inspector Karl Roberts prosecuted. Lawyer Ezekiel Psaila was defence counsel. Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran and Charles Mercieca are representing the company.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: India police asked to probe seven agencies over fake Malta jobs
Body: Nine Indian nationals have asked police in Hyderabad to investigate “fraudulent” immigration agencies, including one they claim sends would-be workers to non-existent jobs in Malta. Complainants say the scam even involves forged Maltese notary signatures, but the agent has denied the claims.  RELATED STORIES  Earlier this month, Times of Malta reported how an Indian employment agency called Abroad Study Plan charged people up to €6,000 for a visa, work permit and a promise of a well-paid job in Malta. However, the workers say they were left jobless after arriving in the country.  It transpires that the agency, owned by Anilkumar Ghanta, is one of seven companies listed in a letter handed to Indian police in August. It is signed by people who say they were “cheated” with promises of jobs in European countries by the recruitment agencies. They “provided fake job offer letters, job contracts, notaries”, the letter, dated August 29, reads.    It said that victims had “their own tragic story” including being refused refunds after a visa was rejected or only having a small amount returned. “Sir, in the case of the five per cent of [those who] gained a visa, people [are] also suffering [in] their destination, like not [being provided] accommodation and job. The consultants are not looking after the clients,” the letter said.     “We earnestly request your honour to kindly refund our amount from concerned consultants and take action against scams please.” Times of Malta spoke to one of the letter authors, Srinivasa Rao, who said he worked at Abroad Study Plan’s Delhi office. Rao was in the process of emigrating to Malta before stopping everything after suspecting “fraud” during the 25 days he worked in the office.  RELATED STORIES  When contacted, Anilkumar Ghanta said Rao was allowed to live in the office premises but never worked there. Sai Kiran Pannala was another person who signed the police letter. He said documents needed for his visa process included forged signatures and notary stamps bearing the name of Maltese notary Joanne Cassar. Times of Malta saw a residential lease, an Identity Malta landlord declaration, and a work contract that were seemingly signed and stamped by the Maltese notary. But when contacted and shown pictures of the documents, Cassar said the signature and stamp bearing her name were fake. “My signature and stamp and handwriting look completely different,” she said. She said she had twice been informed about forged documents signed in her name and in both cases had directed the complainants to the police. It is unclear which agency forged Cassar’s signature. Two media organisations in the Indian state of Telangana reported the issue, showing several men holding a large banner saying: “Action should be taken against those who are deceiving Telugu youth in the name of jobs in Europe. Visa fraud should be stopped… A tearful plea for police department”.    The “victims” gathered at the police headquarters and delivered a letter calling for action.   In the video report by ABN Telugu, one man recounted how he initially paid Abroad Study to begin his immigration process and agreed to pay more after Identity Malta (now Identità) issued their approval.    “They (Abroad Study Plan) told me that within three months he would finish the process and take me to Europe with a work visa, that is what was promised; for that, he told me that I needed to pay two lakhs (around €2,200) initially, and after I got Identity Malta approval I have to pay the rest.”   The man said that after some months, he realised the whole thing was “a big scam” and that only a small portion of the visas were being processed.   Another man said that people who make it to Europe do not fare much better.    “After paying €5,500 to these people, excluding flight expenses, they won’t respond for the people after reaching there, and they are staying without jobs for months on end, and they are again asking for money from their country,” he said. “If they do get jobs, they get something like car cleaning, which is not enough for people who had better jobs in India,” he said. Contacted for comment, Anilkumar Ghanta of Abroad Study Plan denied the allegations made in the police report. He said he never forged signatures or used fake documents. He insisted he always refunded at least 75 per cent of the money he was paid when visas were rejected. Ghanta claimed he could not return the full amount to rejected candidates because of fees charged by employers, Identity Malta, visa slot bookings and notaries. Ghanta said that workers he brought to Malta were usually given a job that paid some €1,000 per month. But in some cases, the job they were supposed to have would no longer be available because of the long migration process, he said. In such cases, Ghanta said he did his utmost to find other employment for people. Like any other business, Ghanta said he seeks to make a profit but “I do not throw people at the roadside”. “In some cases, I even paid out of pocket to help people,” he said.

Title: Canadian ex-fashion mogul convicted of sexual assault
Body: Peter Nygard, the founder of one of Canada's largest clothing brands, was found guilty Sunday on four counts of sexual assault, a court announced in Toronto. The jury, which deliberated for five days, also acquitted the Finnish-Canadian Nygard on one count of sexually assaulting one of the women who testified at the seven-week trial, and one count of forcible confinement, according to Ontario's Superior Court of Justice. The charges against the onetime fashion mogul, now age 82, involved four women and a 16-year-old girl and date from incidents that occurred between 1988 and 2005. The trial addressed the first in a series of charges he faces for sex crimes against multiple women in Canada and the United States and spanning several decades. "I know it's been a long and arduous case for you," Justice Robert Goldstein told the jury. On leaving the courthouse, Nygard's lawyer Brian Greenspan did not rule out the possibility of appealing the verdict. During closing arguments Greenspan had said the case was built on "contradictions and innuendo" and he panned the prosecution's portrayal of his client. "To describe Peter Nygard as an evil predator, a Jekyll and Hyde personality who, through wealth and power, lured women to his den of iniquity and forced women to comply with his sexual demands... is neither fair nor accurate," he said. Greenspan said the complainants' testimony was at times "painfully absurd," and he suggested that four of the women were motivated by financial gain or "gold-digging," as they had admitted to being involved in a US class-action lawsuit against him. Prosecutor Ana Serban, on the other hand, said Nygard on the stand was evasive and inconsistent, and that his memory was unreliable and selective. Serban pointed to "remarkably similar accounts" of his five accusers, independent of each other, about how they met Nygard, were invited to his office building and "how he sexually assaulted them in his private bedroom suite." "The similarities defy coincidence," she said. "It's a pattern of behavior." Testifying in his own defense, Nygard did not recall meeting or knowing four of his accusers, and insisted he never raped any of the five. "The type of allegations that were said and were described is the type of conduct that I know that I have never done, I never would do," he told the court, even while admitting that his memory had become "very fuzzy" with age. Nygard, who in 1967 founded the firm that was to become Nygard International, has been held in detention since his arrest in 2020. He must now face similar charges in Quebec and Manitoba, as well as extradition to the United States, where he has been accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women and girls, racketeering and trafficking.

Title: Belgian police seize nearly 700kg of cocaine at truck stop
Body: Belgian police discovered nearly 700 kilogrammes of cocaine in the back of a truck stopped in a freeway rest area near the port city of Antwerp, prosecutors said Sunday. The 46-year-old Bulgarian driver of the truck was arrested and is custody following the seizure made late Friday. Police found the 698 kilogrammes of cocaine stuffed inside sports bags in the truck's container, according to a statement from the Antwerp prosecutors' office. "The drugs will be destroyed as quickly as possible," it added. Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for cocaine smuggled in from South America to reach the European market, and drug busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently. An unprecedented 110 tonnes of the illegal drug were seized at the port last year. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Marzia Maatouk joins her husband on Europe’s most-wanted list
Body: Marzia Maatouk has been placed on Europol's list of Europe's most wanted fugitives joining her husband Jomic Calleja Maatouk who was placed soon after the couple went missing from Malta in August. Marzia Maatouk, 23, is wanted for Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. She was in July sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted of cannabis possession with intent. The crime took place in August 2019 when she was just 19.  Marzia and Jomic, 30, who was convicted of importing explosives, are believed to have absconded from Malta, probably by sea, since no official sea and air departures list included their names.  At the time, the police believed the couple was in Serbia and that they either used false passports to get out of the country or crossed to Sicily by sea and then drove through Italy northwards.  Soon after their disappearance, Marzia’s family told Times of Malta they were fearing for her safety after the couple’s home was found in a mess.

Title: Teen granted bail after punching ex's boyfriend
Body: A 16-year old who allegedly punched his ex’s boyfriend after the two met to “sort out” a matter about some anonymous letters, was granted bail on Tuesday after admitting to his third brush with the law.  The teenager from Cospicua, whose name was banned from publication because he is a minor, was arrested after his victim reported the incident that took place on October 29 at Senglea.  He had apparently agreed to meet the accused near the Macina in Senglea to sort out matters relating to some anonymous letters allegedly received by the accused’s former girlfriend.  After that meeting, just as the victim was driving away with the 15-year old girl seated next to him in the car, a third party came up and removed the key from the ignition. The accused then walked up and punched him, the victim told the police.  The victim needed surgery to treat his dislocated jaw, the court was told.  The 16-year old offender was charged with causing grievous injuries to his victim in the presence of the underage girl. Moreover, that offence was allegedly committed during the operative term of a probation order handed down in April and a suspended sentence handed down in June.  The accused’s lawyer, Leontine Calleja, said that he was registering an admission but requested a pre-sentencing report.  That request was not objected to by the prosecution and was upheld by the court.  “You’re just 16 and you’ve already had these brushes with the law,”remarked Magistrate Joseph Mifsud, warning the teen that he would end up behind bars unless he changed his ways.  In light of the circumstances and the accused’s early guilty plea, the court upheld the defence’s request for bail against a personal guarantee of €5,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am.  The court also issued a protection order in favour of the victim.  AG lawyer Giuliana Magro Conti and Inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo prosecuted.

Title: Man denied bail after allegedly indecently touching woman on bus
Body: A man who caused a commotion aboard a public bus by allegedly touching a female passenger’s chest and escaping police custody following arrest, was on Tuesday denied bail.  Ahmed Salah Mowlid, 20, was escorted to court following his arrest on Sunday when a bus driver pulled over at the Malta International Airport seeking the help of security officers to get the unruly passenger off the bus.  The youth made the unwelcome move towards a female passenger who was travelling with her boyfriend on the X4 route bus. The indecent touch triggered a commotion, prompting the driver to stop and seek assistance.  The alleged aggressor put up a struggle, shouting and swearing, explained prosecuting Inspector Roxanne Tabone, who charged Mowlid with committing a non-consensual sexual act, insulting and threatening a public official, slightly injuring a third party, resisting arrest, offending public morals, uttering foul words while drunk as well as failing to obey legitimate police orders.  He was also charged with subsequently escaping from police custody.  The accused pleaded not guilty.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution and was subsequently turned down by the court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Mifsud who upheld a request for a Protection Order in favour of the victim.  AG lawyer Danika M Vella and Inspector Roxanne Tabone prosecuted.Lawyer Leontine Calleja was legal aid counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 19-year-old beat his partner and hit her young children, court told
Body: A 19-year-old whipped his partner with a phone cable and assaulted her four children, including an 18-month-old toddler, a court heard on Monday. The charges against 19-year old Luke Galea from Siġġiewi date back to September when his partner reported him to the police domestic violence unit over two separate violent episodes that allegedly took place on September 22 and 23.  The woman claimed that her partner, who was not the father of her children, had beaten her with a phone charger cable, an umbrella as well as a rolling pin at her St Paul’s Bay home.  The violence was allegedly witnessed by the victim’s children aged 18 months, three, five and six years.  During the first incident, the accused also allegedly assaulted the minors. The following day, the man allegedly hit the toddler on the face.  The child was subsequently certified as suffering slight injuries to the forehead.  When spoken to by officers from Child Protection Services, the minors said  their mother had been whipped with a phone cable by the accused who had also had thrown plates at her.  Galea was arrested and charged with slightly injuring the mother and her children, assaulting them as well as failing to inform the relative authorities about his change of address.  He pleaded not guilty.  Answering questions from the defence, prosecuting inspector Audrey Micallef said that the accused’s partner had not gone to the police station to withdraw or update her report.  There was no request for bail at arraignment stage but a request to ban publication of all parties’ names.  However after hearing the prosecutor object to the ban in so far as the accused was concerned - since the couple had only been in a relationship for a year or so - the court, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, upheld the ban only for the mother and the minors.

Title: Keith Schembri's confiscated phone goes missing, is found in another case file
Body: Updated 4.10pm A phone owned by Keith Schembri, held by the courts as part of the evidence in a money laundering case against him went missing for weeks, only to be found in the file of a separate case. This is the second phone owned by the former OPM chief of staff to go missing, after another mobile of his was not found when he was arrested in November 2019 in connection with the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. While in that 2019 incident, Schembri told police that he had misplaced his phone, in this most recent case the phone was lost while in the courts' possession.  Schembri now wants this phone to be struck off as evidence in the case against him, arguing that the odd way his phone was lost and then found by the courts “was far more serious than simply bad administration".  Criminal proceedings against Schembri, his father Alfio and business associates, Robert Zammit and Malcolm Scerri, were stalled for weeks, as the Attorney General was to decide whether to issue a bill of indictment or have the case decided by the Magistrates’ Court.  Then some weeks ago, the prosecuting lawyer from the AG’s office informed Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech - who is presiding over the money laundering case - that Schembri’s phone, seized by police during their investigation into suspected financial crimes, was not in the case file.  When further searches for the device proved futile, the court ordered the expert who last handled the phone to testify so that he could shed light as to the device’s whereabouts.  But the expert said that although he had extracted data from that phone, he had no clue about the device’s location after completing his task.  Faced with that testimony, the magistrate suspended the sitting so as “to look for the phone in her chambers”.  Barely 20 minutes later, Schembri’s lawyers were informed that the missing phone had been traced.  It had somehow ended up in another case file, namely the records of the criminal case against Zenith Finance directors Matthew Pace and Lorraine Falzon, Schembri’s lawyers were told.  But the lawyers noted that the records of the Zenith case had already moved on from the magistrate’s chamber since the directors had opted to go to trial, and thus their file had been forwarded to the Criminal Court.  Following the recovery of the ‘missing’ phone, Magistrate Frendo Dimech dictated a lengthy minute, attributing blame for the disappearance to the courts’ maladministration.  She highlighted the "pitiful" way in which evidence was held by the courts, with evidence "spread across the floor in unsealed bags of papers" and said court workers were often reduced to buying boxes and tape out of their own pocket. The magistrate's criticism comes just one week after the Association of the Maltese Judiciary warned that the under-resourced court system is "on the brink of collapse". Shortly after that episode, an application was filed by lawyers representing “a third party” in separate criminal proceedings, asking the Criminal Court to authorise Schembri’s phone to be produced in evidence in those other proceedings. The case is not linked to the Zenith proceedings.  The sequence of events behind what Schembri's lawyers described as the “whole saga” of the missing phone has now prompted fresh constitutional proceedings by Schembri who claims his right to a fair hearing has been violated.  The “coincidences” and timings after the disappearance of the phone, which was suddenly requested as “an important piece of evidence” in separate proceedings, could not but spark suspicions as to what actually happened “behind the scenes”, Schembri’s lawyers claimed.  The fact that for weeks the phone could not be located was not only a “most serious incident” reflecting grave shortcomings in the way proceedings against Schembri were being handled, but also cast doubt upon the chain of custody of his phone.  This important piece of evidence could have been tampered with since there are doubts as to who had access to the phone during all the weeks that it went missing. It was also inexplicable how the phone was then found within minutes, they said. In the best-case scenario, such circumstances rendered the phone inadmissible since the process was riddled with procedural defects. In the worst-case scenario, what happened hinted at “illegal and possibly criminal behaviour”, argued Schembri’s lawyers in their application filed against the Attorney General, the Police Commissioner and the Registrar Criminal Courts and Tribunals.  Unlike what Magistrate Frendo Dimech had minuted, the lawyers feared that what actually happened “was far more serious than simply bad administration,” said the lawyers calling for the case to be heard urgently.  They also requested the court to declare that Schembri’s rights were breached, that the chain of custody over his phone had been broken and that it was therefore inadmissible in evidence. They sought moral damages and other measures deemed appropriate by the court. Lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo signed the application.

Title: Hamburg airport hostage-taker gives himself up
Body: An armed father who took his four-year-old daughter hostage, forcing the suspension of flights at Hamburg airport, gave himself up "without resistance" on Sunday after hours of negotiations, German police said. The 35-year-old Turkish man had barricaded himself and the child in his car at the foot of a Turkish Airlines plane on Saturday evening, demanding to be allowed on board after a custody dispute with the mother.  He had rammed his car through the security area onto the apron where planes are parked, firing two shots in the air and throwing two burning bottles out of the vehicle, police said. "The hostage-taking has ended," local police posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday. "The man has left his car with his daughter and been taken for questioning by security forces without resistance," it said, adding the child "seems in good health". Police had brought psychologists and teams of negotiators as well as rapid response units to the airport in northern Germany. Authorities said a dispute over custody of the child was believed to be behind the incident, with the wife of the driver placing an emergency call alerting police to the abduction of her child. Police said the man was suffering from psychological troubles and kidnapped the daughter at the mother's home in the nearby town of Stade on Saturday before going to Hamburg airport. They described lengthy negotiations which had taken place in Turkish and announced the father was believed to be "in possession of a loaded weapon and perhaps explosives". The man had at first demanded to be allowed to fly to Turkey with his daughter. During the negotiations, police said that the girl appeared to be physically well, but would not comment on her mental state. The father had already been investigated after kidnapping his daughter in March 2022 and taking her to Turkey. The mother recovered her there, according to the police. - 'Amateurish' security -Passengers aboard the Turkish Airlines plane and the rest of the airport were safely evacuated. "It's annoying. The important thing is that nothing happened to us," passenger Roland Kaminski told German television. "The hotels are all full. Now we're supposed to find beds here somehow." Air traffic remained suspended by late Sunday afternoon, affecting dozens of flights and thousands of passengers. On Saturday evening, 17 flights scheduled to land in Hamburg were diverted. The incident has raised further questions about the airport's security given the ease with which the man forced his way onto the tarmac. In July, environmental activists protesting against pollution caused by planes blocked traffic at the airport for several hours after bursting in on bicycles. "How is it possible that a father in his Audi can simply plough through a barrier and gain access to a high-security zone?," Heinrich Grosbongardt, a well-known air traffic expert in Germany, wrote in Der Spiegel magazine. Heiko Teggatz, a representative of the German police union, said it was "hard to understand" that concrete blocks were used to protect Christmas markets while airports "were made safe in an amateurish way".

Title: Hamburg airport flights halted over 'hostage' situation
Body: Air traffic at Hamburg airport remained suspended Sunday over a suspected hostage situation on the tarmac involving a child, local authorities said. A gunman rammed his car through the security area onto the apron where planes are parked on Saturday evening, firing two shots in the air and flinging two burning bottles out of the vehicle, police said. On Sunday morning the airport management posted on X, formerly Twitter, that efforts to negotiate with the driver of the vehicle were still ongoing. "The police operation continues, air traffic remains suspended until further notice," posted the management of the northern German airport. Police spokeswoman Sandra Levgrun told the regional channel of public television NDR that it is believed a father and his child are in the car. Authorities have said a "custody dispute" is believed to be the cause of the incident, with the wife of the driver placing an emergency call alerting police to the abduction of her child. The daily Bild newspaper reported that the driver is 35 years old and of Turkish nationality, and that the child is a girl aged four years old. The driver has barricaded himself in his car at the foot of a Turkish Airlines plane. "We are on site with a large contingent of emergency services. We are currently assuming a static hostage situation," Hamburg police had posted earlier on X. Levgrun told NDR that police psychologists had been mobilised to try to negotiate a solution with the driver. She called it a "very good sign" that he had remained in contact with the authorities over a prolonged period of time. On Saturday evening, 17 flights scheduled to land in Hamburg were diverted. Another 286 flight are scheduled for Sunday, carrying some 34,500 passengers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Fruit vendor gets suspended jail term in €25,000 fraud case
Body: A fruit and vegetable seller who defrauded three people out of €25,000 was jailed for two years suspended for four after he was convicted of fraud. The 44-year-old man, whose name was banned from publication, was given three years to return the sum he had gained illicitly. He has since paid back €5,000 of the amount he swindled. The court heard very little details of the case since the man changed his plea to guilty before his victims could testify. The crime was committed on and before September 2021. During his arraignment, the man was inclined to register an admission but then had a change of heart after the court, presided over by Magistrate Charmaine Galea, observed that he had been handed a three-year probation order over similar charges in the past. Upon his admission during the compilation of evidence, Magistrate Joe Mifsud ordered a pre-sentencing report, with a probation officer recommending to the court that the man is given a suspended jail term and ordered to repay his victims. Handing down his judgment, Mifsud explained how a punishment should serve as an opportunity for a person who was convicted of a crime to learn from his mistakes. In the circumstances, the court believed that he should be given time to reform and bring his life back on the right track. In considering what punishment should be meted out, Magistrate Mifsud said that if he were to order the restitution of the amount he swindled, this would not be possible if he were to be jailed and the victims would remain without their money. He, therefore, opted to uphold the recommendation in the pre-sentencing report and hand down a suspended jail term. He also urged the defendant to continue addressing his problems. Police inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Shaun Pawney prosecuted, while lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.

Title: Charges dropped against suspended Malta Philharmonic conductor - lawyers
Body: The suspended principal conductor of the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra has been acquitted of fraud charges, his lawyers have said.  Sergey Smbatyan was suspended from his role in the orchestra in July, after international media reported that he and his father - a former Armenian ambassador to Israel - were arrested on charges related to real estate fraud in their native Armenia.  In a statement, Smbatyan’s lawyers said the Armenian prosecutor’s office had decided to stop pursuing the charges against him. “Herewith we inform you that by the decision of the Prosecutor of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Armenia dated October 27, 2023, Maestro Sergey Smbatyan was acquitted, and the criminal prosecution against him was ceased on the basis that he did not commit the guilty act,” the statement said.   RELATED STORIES  At the time of the arrest, the acting CEO of the orchestra Christopher Muscat said that the MPO was “suspending” its relationship with Smbatyan until “the relevant facts and circumstances are ascertained”.  In Armenia, Smbatyan also serves as the artistic director and principal conductor of the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra.  In a statement on Facebook, Smbatyan said that the outcome of the legal proceedings against him could only have “one resolution”.  “That was to clarify unnecessary public misunderstandings and denial of the accusations made against me,” he said.    “Thank you to everyone who has stood by me over the past months and waited with me in faith for this day. Your faith inspires and keeps me moving.” Times of Malta asked the MPO and the Culture Ministry whether there were any plans to reinstate Smbatyan as the principal conductor of the orchestra.

Title: Australian woman faces court for alleged mushroom murders
Body: An Australian woman appeared in court Friday accused of murdering her inlaws with a toxic mushroom lunch and attempting to kill her estranged husband four times. Erin Patterson, 49, is charged with three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous beef Wellington that killed her parents-in-law and a third lunch guest, the wife of a local pastor. Police have previously suggested the crusted beef fillet was laced with death cap mushrooms. Patterson, a former newsletter editor, was taken into custody this week following a headline-grabbing, three-month investigation.  The alleged triple murder has rocked the sedate farming town of Leongatha, about two hours' drive southeast of Melbourne. Leongatha is better known for its medieval society's re-enactments and its annual daffodil festival. Patterson has also been charged with repeatedly trying to murder her estranged husband Simon Patterson, who was identified in police charge sheets released to the media on Friday. Police said Simon Patterson "became ill after meals" on separate occasions in 2021 and 2022, and have charged Erin Patterson with four counts of attempted murder.  The 49-year-old was flanked by guards as she made her first appearance in Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court on Friday morning. She wore a beige jersey and appeared composed throughout the brief administrative hearing. Patterson will return to court in May 2024 after police secured a 20-week adjournment so that detectives have enough time to comb through computers seized from her house.  Patterson allegedly cooked the beef Wellington in late July, serving her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather, 66. The two couples allegedly started experiencing food poisoning symptoms later that night and, with their health rapidly deteriorating, they sought the help of doctors at local hospitals. Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson died in the days following the lunch while Ian Wilkinson eventually recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital. Patterson has repeatedly protested her innocence, saying she had bought the mushrooms from an Asian grocery store and was "devastated" that her cooking may have caused her loved ones to fall ill.  Detectives spent Thursday searching through Patterson's house in Leongatha. Homicide squad Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said the intense media scrutiny surrounding the investigation had taken its toll on the sleepy rural town, where the consequences would "reverberate for years to come".  "Over the last three months, this investigation has been subjected to incredibly intense levels of public scrutiny and curiosity," he said in a statement Thursday following Patterson's arrest.  "I cannot think of another investigation that has generated this level of media and public interest, not only here in Victoria but also nationally and internationally. "I think it is particularly important that we keep in mind that at the heart of this, three people have lost their lives." Death cap mushrooms sprout freely throughout wet, warm parts of Australia and are easily mistaken for edible varieties. They reportedly taste sweeter than other types of mushrooms but possess potent toxins that slowly poison the liver and kidneys.

Title: Valletta businesses forced to ‘hire security’ to tackle teen gangs
Body: Teen gangs are visiting Valletta on weekends to fight and destroy property, forcing at least two businesses to hire security to tackle the problem. “They run around, take stuff from tables and try to get a rise out of people,” said one worker from a café opposite the parliament building. “They want to start fights but we will not start fights. Instead we call security or the police,” another worker from the capital’s Burger King outlet said. Large groups of teens starting fights in the city have become a growing problem. A series of videos showing teens beating each other in Valletta were recently shared on social media. One video showed a girl being kicked and punched by other girls near Hastings Garden while another showed a gang of boys fighting while screams are heard in the background.   These are not isolated problems but regular occurrences, shop workers told Times of Malta, as large groups of “rude” teens loiter around the city entrance every weekend. “They come in here every Saturday and throw things around,” a Burger King worker said. With several outlets across the island, Burger King Valletta is close to the entrance of the city, opposite parliament. “Last Saturday, someone came behind the counter, came into our kitchen and started shouting at staff,” they said, prompting security to kick them out. “We have a security guard every Saturday simply because of these groups of teens,” they said. The problem has persisted for at least a year, the worker said, recalling a time when he kicked out a group of roughly five teens – boys and girls – after they destroyed some chairs and a table.  RELATED STORIES  “They waited for me outside the restaurant on two Saturday nights,” the worker said, prompting the worker to call the police. Yet, once the police arrived, the group dispersed and ran off to another spot within Valletta, they said. A worker from L’Accademia Café, in Valletta, also opposite parliament, explained that between 40 and 50 teens regularly group together on Saturday evenings, hassling customers and causing commotion. “They stand on tables and steal chairs. Sometimes, they fight over there,” the employee said, pointing at a space in front of parliament. “We try to stop them but they either ignore us or they're rude to us,” they said. “Sometimes, we even had to hire security,” they said, as festive seasons see more rowdy teens come to the city. With Christmas around the corner, L’Accademia workers are worried about the surge of teens who will come to Valletta, as school holidays will give adolescents more free time to gather. There have been sporadic cases of people being seriously injured after being attacked by teen gangs. In January, a 15-year-old boy was hospitalised with a broken leg after he and his friends were attacked by a group of older teens in Valletta. A 30-year-old woman also came forward about an incident in December when she was punched, kicked and had her hair ripped out by a gang of young teens. Speaking to Times of Malta, one 17-year-old shared his personal experience with one of these groups that left him hospitalised in October 2022. “These people tracked me down and followed me home,” he said. He described walking home from a friend’s house in October last year when he noticed a large group of roughly 16 teens following him. “’We just want to talk,’” he recalled them telling him, asking him to come to a corner to have a chat. They walked the 17-year-old to a nearby restaurant where the incident turned violent. “It ended up with 16 people pushing me up against a wall and beating me,” he said. “All I was thinking was ‘I just want to go home and forget this ever happened’.” Passers-by tried to intervene but the group told them to keep walking, he said. Bloody and bruised, the teenager walked to the Valletta police station where officers took him back to the spot of the beating. “No one was there, they had all scattered and gone elsewhere.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: US policeman pleads guilty in beating death of man
Body: One of the five US police officers charged in the beating death of a young African-American man in the southern city of Memphis pleaded guilty Thursday, the Justice Department announced. Bodycam footage of the January incident showed the officers, who are all Black, repeatedly kicking and punching Tyre Nichols, 29, during a traffic stop close to his home in Memphis. Nichols died in hospital three days later. The guilty plea by Desmond Mills comes as part of a settlement of pending state and federal charges, and marks a course reversal given that he had pleaded not guilty along with the other four officers in February when they appeared in court in Tennessee. Already facing felony charges from the state of Tennessee, the five police officers were indicted in September by a federal grand jury in Memphis. Mills, 33, pleaded guilty Thursday to two of four counts in the indictment -- excessive force and failing to intervene as well as an attempted coverup -- according to a statement from the Justice Department. The Shelby County District Attorney's office said in a statement that the plea was "part of a global settlement of all pending state and federal charges and comes after Mills pled guilty this morning to these federal charges." The other four officers have pleaded not guilty to federal charges. Lawyers for Nichols's family, who are suing the city of Memphis in civil court over his death, said the Mills plea confirmed he was not "an individual actor" in the crime. "These officers, including Mills, acted at the direction of a policy that not only violated civil rights of innocent civilians but which caused needless pain to many," they said in a statement. The trial of the other four police officers is scheduled for May 2024, according to the statement. Nichols was stopped for an alleged traffic violation and was beaten viciously by the officers, in scenes recorded in body camera and security camera footage that triggered outrage when made public. Vice President Kamala Harris attended Nichols' funeral in February and Nichols' family members were invited to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address in Washington several days later.

Title: Man arrested following series of thefts from cars in St Paul's Bay
Body: A 35-year-old man was arrested in St Paul's Bay on Wednesday, following a series of thefts from cars in the area throughout September and October. The police said in a statement the man, a Croatian who lives in St Paul's Bay, was tracked down by district officials soon after they received a report that a person was seen trying to break into a car. The officers patrolled the area and when they spotted the man, they gave chase. He entered a block of apartments and jumped a height of around a storey and a half into a private garden. He jumped over another wall with the police on his tail. The man was eventually tracked down in a garage complex. A search at his house yielded several items that had been reported stolen in the previous months.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Commotion in Marsascala after argument, unverified claims of gunfire
Body: Confusion and commotion reigned in Marsascala on Thursday evening after an alleged argument and claims of "gunfire sounds" led to a heavy police presence. The argument in Triq Sant' Antnin was reported at around 4.30pm, with the police receiving reports from one of the men involved that he had heard gunshot sounds shortly after the altercation.   Within minutes, at least seven police cars were spotted on site by Times of Malta readers, including the Rapid Intervention Unit.  However, once on site, the officers did not find anybody injured and there was no evidence of any gunfire, a police spokesperson told Times of Malta.

Title: Israeli strikes on Gaza refugee camp could be war crimes: UN
Body: Deadly Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip's largest refugee camp "could amount to war crimes", the UN Human Rights Office said on Wednesday.  Israeli strikes have targeted the Jabalia refugee camp twice in two days, killing and wounding dozens, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.  Israel said Tuesday's raid was a successful hit on top Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari. "Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza in retribution for the worst attack in the country's history. Hamas gunmen stormed across the border from Gaza on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.  Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign has killed 8,796 people, mainly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry. The principle of proportionality referred to by the UN plays a central role in the wars of law defined by the Geneva Conventions. Civilians and civilian structures must be spared - but the death of civilians during a conflict does not necessarily constitute a war crime. Warring parties can launch attacks deemed proportionate on military targets even while knowing that civilians could also be hit.  A crime is committed when an attack is deliberately carried out against civilians, or if the scale of the damage to civilians is excessive compared to the military advantage. The International Criminal Court is the only independent international legal authority that carries out investigations into genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, but Israel is not a member. AFPTV images from Wednesday's strike on the camp showed extensive damage and rescuers clawing through rubble to extract blood-stained casualties. The large death toll from the strikes has drawn a chorus of international condemnation, with Bolivia severing diplomatic ties with Israel in protest. Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel "to condemn the Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza". UN chief Antonio Guterres is "appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza, including the killing of Palestinians, including women and children in Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday.

Title: Germany moves to classify sexual violence as war crime
Body: The German government on Wednesday approved a draft law allowing sexual violence in conflict zones to be prosecuted as a war crime and a crime against humanity. The centre-left-led coalition passed a justice ministry measure allowing a change to Germany's criminal code. It would permit Germany to probe such crimes committed abroad under the principle of "universal jurisdiction". The change would mean that the existing war crimes definition would be expanded to encompass sexual assault, sexual enslavement and forced pregnancy termination. "Sexual violence, primarily against women, has long been used in conflict worldwide by terrorists, systematically in armed conflicts and as a tactical weapon," German family and women's affairs minister Lisa Paus told AFP.  Berlin was seeking to bolster "the rights of the victims of this horrible crime by allowing them to take an active part in the criminal trial" as co-plaintiffs, Paus said. The impetus behind the new legislation, which still requires parliamentary approval, was widespread accounts of sexual assault since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she said. Paus of the Green party also pointed to reports of the rape of Israelis by Hamas fighters in the October 7 attacks. "International criminal law has become dramatically relevant since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine," Justice Minister Marco Buschmann of the liberal Free Democrats said in a statement.   The third party in the ruling coalition, the Social Democrats, noted the importance of the legal reform in explicitly protecting LGBTQ people in war zones, calling it "historic". "War crimes" and "crimes against humanity" were both defined in the 1998 Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). A war crime covers more than 50 scenarios, including killing, torture, rape and hostage-taking. Germany has in the past repeatedly prosecuted atrocities committed abroad, including in the war in Syria.  It does so using universal jurisdiction which allows countries to try people for crimes of exceptional gravity, including war crimes and genocide, even if they were committed in a different country. UN investigators probing violations in Ukraine since Russia's invasion reported in March that Moscow was behind a vast array of war crimes, including widespread attacks on civilians and infrastructure, killings, torture, rape and other sexual violence.

Title: Plasterer used shadow finance system to move millions, terrorism case told
Body: A Syrian man arrested following a magisterial inquiry into reports of terrorism-related activity in Malta transferred some €2.5 million to 13 countries in two years, an investigation has revealed. A money laundering inspector testified that the transfers were multi-national, including Australia, Belgium, Iraq, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. He was testifying against the 35-year-old plasterer Ebrahem Ahmad who stands accused of money laundering, operating an illegal banking service operation and involvement in a criminal organisation. He is pleading not guilty. The officer's investigation revealed that Ahmad had allegedly been offering banking services without a licence. The Financial Crimes Investigation Department inspector testified before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech. He said investigations began around mid-April this year when the FCID was asked to assist the antiterrorism squad in an investigation into a group that was spreading pro-ISIS material. Seven men were subsequently charged with terrorism-related offences. The inspector – whose name cannot be published by court order - said the defendant was known as “the banker,” and would use the hawala money transfer system to pay for travel and other goods and services. According to the International Monetary Fund, hawala is an informal system of transferring money around the world. Along with its traditional role of transferring money between individuals and families, often in different countries, it is also linked with financing illegal and terrorist activities. The inspector said Ahmad did not have any bank accounts in Malta. However, he was registered with the VAT and Inland Revenue departments as a self-employed plasterer. He had also been given a Maltese social security number, but had never received any social benefits, said the inspector. The inspector explained that during an anti-terror raid, the police had to force open the front door to the apartment in question, finding three men, two women and four children inside - all relatives of Ahmad. While searching the apartment, the inspector looked out of a bathroom window into the shaft and noticed an object that appeared to be a mobile phone at the bottom. It was retrieved and found to have a picture of the defendant’s youngest son on the lock screen. “At first he tried to justify his financial dealings by claiming that he would help the local Syrian community in dealing with banks in Turkey but he later admitted to using hawala to transfer money to a relative in Syria and another man on the Turkey-Syria border,” the inspector said. Data recovered from his mobile phone showed that the men who were currently accused of terrorism offences had used his services to send money to their families in Syria. The device also contained receipts from overseas companies that are involved in money transfers, involving 13 different countries, which include Australia, Belgium, Iraq, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. “In two years he transferred a total of around €2.5 million. He would charge between three and 10 per cent commission on the money transferred,” said the inspector, explaining that the amounts transferred were also reflected in chat records with his overseas contact in Syria. The head of MFSA’s banking sector, Anthony Sacco, told the court that Ahmad had no licence to operate a banking operation in Malta. He was asked at which point would transferring of funds be considered a banking operation, but the witness could not reply.   “Can a person receive a sum of money, travel to another country and pass it on to a third party?” defence counsel Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea asked. “If used legitimately he can,” replied the witness, who went on to explain that a banking licence “means you can accept deposits and lend money.” “Is hawala banking an accepted banking practice? Would you need a banking licence for it?” Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech asked the witness, who replied that he had never heard of it. When the case against another two Syrian men charged with possession and dissemination of terrorism-related material was called, Magistrate Frendo Dimech recused herself after it was pointed out that she had also led the magisterial inquiry against other men facing similar charges and who are appearing before a different magistrate, which inquiry was presented also in these proceedings.  Farhan Mohammed Sheikh and Abdulla Aliwi are pleading not guilty. “It’s very obvious that this case shouldn’t have come before me,” the magistrate remarked, rebuking the prosecution for not pointing out this issue as soon as it was informed that she had been assigned the compilation of evidence. Lawyers Antoine Agius Bonnici, Francesco Refalo and Rebekah Spiteri from the Office of the Attorney General are prosecuting, assisted by.

Title: Woman recalls being assaulted by murder suspect as she brushed her teeth
Body: A woman has recounted how a man accused of murdering two other people attacked her with a bolt cutter.  Queen OG Bayamma told the court that was in her bathroom brushing her teeth when she was hit on her head, face and arms and knocked down to the ground before her brother burst in and saved her from the aggressor. Bayamma was testifying in the case against Iddrisu Fajsal, a 34-year-old who stands accused of murdering Joseph Bartolo, 73 and Carmen Abela, 56, on October 15, attempting to murder Banyamma and slightly injuring her brother. Bartolo and Abela were found dead at a Marsa farmhouse early that morning. They had been stabbed. Fajsal was arrested shortly after police were called to the scene. The court previously heard that the two deceased victims had converted an old horse-riding school on Triq it-Tigrija in Marsa into living quarters. Bartolo, Abela, Banyamma and Fajsal are all understood to have been living on the property at the time of the attack.  Testifying on Tuesday, Banyamma recalled how Fajsal had burst in on her and started attacking her without reason. “My brother managed to get him out. If he hadn’t, I don’t know what would have happened,” she said. Banyamma’s brother, Ifayeni Ezeh, happened to be at the Marsa farmhouse to visit his sister. He usually lives in Żabbar. Ezeh told the court that he was asleep when he heard a commotion and his sister’s voice. It was dark and before he knew it, he was tangled up in a fight with the accused. He said he did not know the accused, though his face was familiar. As the two fought, three police officers showed up. The officers ordered them to stop fighting, Ezeh testified, but the accused did not. “I asked him why he was trying to kill my sister, and he did not reply,” the witness testified. Ezeh said he eventually managed to get the bolt cutter out of the accused’s hands and tossed it towards the officers. Those three officers, George Attard, Stephen Bonello and Michele Farrugia, also testified on Tuesday. They were told by a civilian that two men were fighting close to Triq December 13. At the time, they were some distance away but could see two black men tussling, the court heard. As soon as they got to the scene, they noticed that one of the men was holding a large pair of “scissors” that were “covered in blood”. Two women close by, who they later learned were relatives of one of the murder victims, were crying. At the time, the officers were not aware that two people had been killed. The shorter of the two men eventually got the shears off the other and tossed them towards the police. The accused then tried to run away and leapt over a padlocked gate. Police forced the gate open and found the accused hiding behind a container. He did not cooperate with police, and he was tasered and then arrested. Defence lawyer Joe Brincat told the court that Bayamma had not presented any medical certificates to prove she had been grievously injured, as she claimed. He objected to the prosecution’s request for the court to order that the man stand trial on indictment, saying evidence presented so far did not justify that. Prosecutors disagreed, saying there was abundant proof linking the accused to the crime. The court, presided by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, is to decree on the prima facie on November 13. Lawyers Joe Brincat and Julia Micallef Stafrace are defence counsel. Inspectors Kurt Zahra and Wayne Camilleri are prosecuting. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Kris Busietta and Franco Debono are appearing parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man who masterminded arson attack 12 years ago gets six and half-years in prison
Body: A man who instructed a drug addict to set fire to the door of a Qormi home 12 years ago was condemned to six and a half years in jail after being found guilty of complicity in the arson.  Justice caught up with Keith Camilleri when, years after the incident, his accomplice name-dropped him to the police, supplying a detailed account of events that August day in 2011.  The two men had met at the detox centre while they were both struggling with drug addiction.  Later that afternoon at around 3.15 pm, a police constable stationed in Qormi caught sight of a person slipping behind a bamboo curtain hanging outside the front door of a private residence in St Francis Street.  The person seemed to be holding some sort of cloth.  Then suddenly, the curtain burst into flames just as a male figure fled the scene, with the policeman giving chase.  The officer managed to catch up with the suspect, Mario Martin Baldacchino, who was also in possession of a lighter.  He was arrested and was subsequently charged with arson. Baldacchino was eventually convicted of the crime and was handed a six-year term of imprisonment.  Baldacchino hinted he had more to say to the police shortly after his arrest, but he only named Camilleri as the person who ordered the arson five years after the fact. Baldacchino testified against the alleged mastermind after his case was finalised and he was already serving his sentence. He recounted how that day, Camilleri had offered him a lift home from the detox centre and along the way had asked him to set fire to the door of a private residence. Camilleri drove past that residence, pointed it out to Baldacchino and handed him a container of petrol before dropping him off in the vicinity.  Camilleri, nicknamed ‘Holy Ghost’, had promised him €500 in return, but that money never materialized, Baldacchino explained. Camilleri had “manipulated” him, knowing very well about his drug addiction at the time.  Since he was under the influence of drugs, he could not run too fast and that was why the police officer had caught him in the act.  Baldacchino’s version was deemed credible by the court which also noted his attitude at the witness stand, his account consistent throughout, down to the least detail.  Moreover, the prosecution had produced circumstantial evidence which further corroborated that version of events.  Just minutes before the fire broke out, Camilleri was involved in a traffic collision just a kilometre or so away from the crime scene.  Court experts reported that the damage to the door amounted to €1600. An arson expert confirmed that a piece of cloth soaked in fuel had been set alight and placed next to the door. Luckily, since the door was fire-resistant, the fuel had not seeped indoors and the flames did not make their way into the home.  At the time of the arson, the three occupants of the house were on the rooftop with two workmen.  The prosecution also proved the charge of recidivism.  Camilleri has four previous convictions which attested to the “life of crime” he had been accustomed to at the time and no evidence was produced to show that he had changed his ways, observed the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.  When all was considered the court found him guilty of all charges except for complicity in the wilful damage to third party property and condemned him to six and a half years imprisonment. The court also placed him under a three-year restraining order and ordered him to reimburse the victims €1600 within six months.  Inspectors Mario Xiberras and Jeffrey Scicluna prosecuted.

Title: Prosecution of former top police officer suspected of corruption stalls
Body: A former top police officer suspected of corruption with murder suspect Yorgen Fenech has yet to be prosecuted. Ray Aquilina, the former head of the police’s anti-money laundering unit, was arrested in April 2021. The arrest formed part of a wider probe into police and government officials who potentially leaked sensitive information to suspects in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation. Times of Malta had reported in 2021 how investigators felt there were grounds to prosecute Aquilina. However, an official familiar with the probe said a decision was taken to delay any prosecutions until after the magisterial inquiry into the leaks has been concluded. The police are empowered to act independently of such inquiries. As part of the leaks probe, investigators zoomed in on the planned sale of a Birżebbuġa apartment to Aquilina, that Fenech was suspected of facilitating. At that stage, Aquilina was meant to be investigating Fenech over his ownership of 17 Black, a secret company suspected to have been intended to funnel payments to former government officials Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri. Instead of Aquilina appearing as the property buyer, the property transaction was to be fronted by his parents, who would then donate it to their son. Documents reviewed by Times of Malta indicate that Aquilina had claimed he was not buying the property directly himself as he was undergoing separation proceedings with his wife, and therefore did not want the property to form part of their joint assets. Aquilina had claimed during the sale process that the property acquisition was being funded through his personal savings. The former police officer’s relationship with Fenech came under scrutiny soon after the arrest of self-confessed murder middleman Melvin Theuma in November 2019. Theuma was arrested as part of a money laundering operation that was used as a guise to obtain recordings the murder middleman secretly took with Fenech. According to court testimony, messages exchanged between Fenech and Theuma in the days and hours leading up to the middleman’s arrest indicated the pair knew the planned money laundering raids were just a guise for the police to obtain the recordings. As Theuma became increasingly nervous about his impending arrest, Fenech had assured him that “Ray”, understood to be a reference to Aquilina, was going to be handling the arrest. Soon after retiring from the police force, Aquilina was appointed as a manager within Enemalta’s internal audit and governance section. He no longer occupies the role. The magisterial inquiry into the leaks has been open for close to four years. Keith Schembri, the right-hand man of former prime minister Joseph Muscat, featured as one of the suspects in the inquiry, along with ex-police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar and ex-deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta. All concerned deny wrongdoing. Fenech is set to face a trial over his alleged role in commissioning the murder. He denies masterminding the October 2017 assassination, with his lawyers last week suggesting that Schembri is the murder mastermind.

Title: Three more men in court following inquiry into terrorism activity in Malta
Body: Three Syrian men tracked down following a magisterial inquiry into reports of terrorism-related activity, were on Friday charged with money laundering, involvement in a criminal organisation and sharing of terrorist material. One of the men, who faced the lesser charges of money laundering, was granted bail against a hefty deposit of €40,000 and a personal guarantee of €80,000. The other two were remanded in custody. The three men were arraigned in relation to an inquiry that earlier this year led to seven other arraignments of suspects who shared terrorist-related material. That inquiry had been closed and then re-opened. It was currently ongoing, AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici told court. The first to be arraigned on Friday - Syrian national Ebrahem Ahmad, 35 - was charged with money laundering, operating banking services without a licence and involvement in a criminal organisation.  RELATED STORIES  The plasterer, who lives in Pieta', pleaded not guilty.  When his lawyers requested bail, the prosecution objected saying investigations were ongoing and some 30 other people were still to be questioned.  But that objection prompted a strong rebuttal by the defence and a stern reaction by the court.  "The accused was on police bail for some six months and there was no issue. Now that he's been arraigned, you're saying that he might approach witnesses," argued lawyer Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea.  The investigation was still ongoing, countered the prosecution.  "I cannot bear to hear this objection - that 'the investigation is ongoing' - any longer. I wish you'd come with some better justification, "observed Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit.  "By now you should be aware of the arguments raised by the defence to counter such an objection," she added. The man was granted bail on condition of not approaching prosecution witnesses, especially civilians, signing the bail book daily, respect a curfew between 11pm and 6am, a deposit of €40,000 and a personal guarantee of €80,000.   The other two men were arraigned jointly and were charged with sharing terrorist material.  Farhan Mohammed Sheikh, 29, from Ħamrun and Abdullah Aliwi, 23, from Paola pleaded not guilty. The plasterers are both Syrian nationals. Defence lawyer Jose' Herrera started off by noting that these arraignments stemmed from one magisterial inquiry.  The charges were not the same but the same arguments applied. His argument was backed by defence lawyer Franco Debono.  The case of the other seven Syrians currently undergoing criminal proceedings had been highly publicised.  These two other co-accused were out on police bail and had all the time to approach witnesses and tamper. AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici rebutted that "the situation [of the two accused] is totally different" to that of Ahmad's.  "You cannot compare. These are facing terrorism charges. You cannot compare money laundering to terrorism charges," he said. Terrorism-related charges have a possible maximum punishment of life imprisonment.  Their arraignment, he added, formed part of a global operation against terrorism.  Besides the gravity of the crimes, there was also the fear of tampering, Agius Bonnici said, adding that even from within prison, there were people who had reached out to prosecution witnesses, ensured that some mobile data was cancelled and alerted suspects abroad not to come to Malta. Others had been told what to say if questioned.  Moreover, these two had travelled to Malta illegally, he said. While one was sent to Greece, he had returned to Malta.  EU law made it clear that those who promote terrorism were to face the same punishment as those who committed terrorist acts, he said, adding that such crimes impacted the whole population.  There was a public interest and a concern for national security, stressed the prosecutor. Herrera meanwhile noted that the two accused had simply received material on their devices and had not shared it.  Their case, lawyer Matthew Xuereb added, was less complex than the money-laundering charges and cross-border activities by Ahmad who had been granted bail. Debono put forward another argument: although the prosecution spoke in terms of the maximum punishment related to these charges, the actual punishment could well be much less.  After hearing submissions the court turned down the request for bail in light of the very serious nature of the charges, to safeguard public order and national security and in light of the risk of other possible future crimes.  There was also the risk of absconding, further enhanced by the fact that the charges carried a heavier punishment. AG lawyers Francesco Refalo and Rebekah Spiteri also prosecuted together with Inspector Jean Paul Attard, Zachary Zammit and Keith Mallan.  Lawyer Mario Mifsud was also defence counsel in the first arraignment while Martina Herrera was also defence counsel in the second arraignment.

Title: Cab driver who took hold-up suspects to Żurrieq jeweller recalls 'weird feeling'
Body: Updated 8.30pm A cab driver who drove three people from Żebbuġ to Żurrieq, where they allegedly robbed a jeweller and beat him up, described a "weird feeling" that crept over him during that trip.  The Greek national took the witness stand on Friday when proceedings continued against Donna Borg Sciberras, 29, Mohamed Anas Boualam, 37 and Zuhair Hadoumi, 26, who are pleading not guilty to that violent robbery that left jeweller Joseph Carabott “worse than dead”. The witness, a self-employed taxi driver, identified all three accused as the passengers he picked up from a  Żebbuġ residence on August 25 evening. They booked the ride through Bolt.  He picked them up shortly after 6pm and dropped them off close to the Żurrieq church, on Dun Ġużepp Zammit Street, at 6.36pm.  During that ride, Borg Sciberras sat next to him, while the men sat at the back.  “They spoke another language. So I didn't understand what they were saying,” explained the driver, adding he did recall the woman telling him they were headed to Żurrieq to pick up her seven-year-old son.  “But I had mixed feelings… The way the two gentlemen at the back were looking at me made me feel weird.”  Shortly after that trip, he received an “urgent” call from the police headquarters in Floriana. The investigating officer there explained that the police were working on a “really, really serious crime” and asked him for all the details he could supply about that trip.  The driver told them all he knew, also providing footage from his dashcam which proved important in helping the police identify two of the suspects: Borg Sciberras and Anas.  The third suspect had still not been identified, even though his face was visible on the footage, including that retrieved from the robbery scene and the suspects’ pick-up point at Blue Grotto Avenue.  The following Sunday, police officers looking through CCTV footage identified the third suspect as Hadoumi. His address was traced to a residence in Manuel Dimech Street, Sliema.  That was where police rounded up and arrested the suspect trio, said Inspector Jonathan Cassar from the Drug Squad.  When police knocked at the door of the residence, they suddenly heard a glass drop and footsteps. A police sergeant from the Criminal Investigation Department, who had assisted in the arrests, told court they had forced their way in.  The officers headed upstairs onto the roof where they caught sight of two men running across the rooftops of neighbouring properties.  As they gave chase, something caught the sergeant’s attention and he found Borg Sciberras hiding on the roof.  He handed over her arrest to a colleague and proceeded to assist the other officers in chasing the two male suspects. They were tracked down inside an abandoned property whose rooftop door was open.  The police searched Hadoumi's property. In one room on the first floor, they found two black bags and a mobile phone. Another bag on a bedside table contained a pouch, a gold cross, a small price tag, another mobile phone and documents. The police also found cash and another bag containing two watches.  They discovered a black bag behind some pieces of wood tucked in the space below the stairs leading to the roof. That bag appeared to be the same one that Borg Sciberras was carrying when she walked out of the Żurrieq jewellery shop.  The bag was full of gold items.  Another officer from the Major Crimes Unit testified about his involvement in the search at the  Żebbuġ residence: the point of departure and of return of the suspects on the day of the robbery.   The suspects were not present when the police arrived at the house, but an Egyptian man who rented a room at the house explained that Anas was his housemate.  The man led the officers to his room where they found cannabis and ecstasy pills.  The man is currently facing separate drug-related charges and is under preventive arrest.  Inside the room shared by Anas and Borg Sciberras, besides a small white price tag, a pair of studded earrings and a mobile phone lying on the bed, the police also found a grey zip-up jacket with black and white sleeves.  It matched the one that Borg Sciberras had put on after the robbery as she left Blue Grotto Avenue in another cab, together with her alleged accomplices.  That jacket, along with other items seized from the  Żebbuġ property, were exhibited as evidence. One of those items was a blue file, labeled ‘Anas,’ which contained the accused’s birth certificate, payslips, vehicle documents and other personal papers.  Following the trio’s arrests, Hadoumi led police to a shaft inside the Żebbuġ residence where he had disposed of a knife. Its handle had been used to strike the victim during the robbery.  Anas had been carrying another knife but Hadoumi did not know anything about its whereabouts.  He also told police that after the robbery they had changed their clothes and put them in garbage bags opposite the house.  The bags were not there when police searched for them. The case, presided over by Magistrate Ian Farrugia, continues. AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett prosecuted together with inspectors Shaun Pawney and Jonathan Cassar. Lawyers Mark Mifsud Cutajar, Maria Karlsson and Brandon Kirk Muscat were defence counsel. Lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Ana Thomas appeared parte civile.

Title: MUMN says it ‘never interfered with treatment of Abner Aquilina’
Body: The nurses’ union never interfered with the treatment of prisoner Abner Aquilina but merely requested a police presence for safety reasons, union chief Paul Pace has said. Pace was reacting to comments made by Aquilina’s defence lawyer Mario Mifsud in court last week. The lawyer claimed Aquilina was sent back to prison because he was being treated inhumanely and kept locked in a room at Mount Carmel Hospital for 23 hours a day.  He argued it was “the first time in Malta’s history” that a union decided how a patient at the mental hospital was to be treated, rendering a magistrate’s decision to move him there ineffective.  Mifsud’s comments followed an instruction by the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses for members to abandon their ward if Aquilina was moved there.  Aquilina, who has now been transferred to the Corradino Correctional Facility, is pleading not guilty to strangling and murdering 29-year-old Polish student Paulina Dembska on January 2, 2022.  Following his arraignment over the murder, Aquilina was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty.     When the compilation of evidence started, Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia raised the issue of insanity and appointed three psychiatrists to assess the accused’s mental state.  In June last year, experts reported that Aquilina was insane at the time of the offence. The magistrate ordered that he was to be detained at Mount Carmel Hospital.    That order could only be reversed upon a subsequent report by three psychiatrists declaring that he could be discharged from hospital.  However, two months after the magistrate’s order, the hospital’s CEO Stephanie Xuereb filed an application before the Criminal Court requesting that Aquilina be transferred to the hospital’s Forensic Unit.  The unit is classified as a prison and is under the sole control of the prisons’ director. Xuereb argued that the hospital had no licence to care for inmates with mental health problems, and that these were to be handled at the Forensic Unit.  That request was upheld by a judge in the superior court and the transfer took place.  Aquilina’s lawyers then filed an application requesting the Magistrates’ Court to reverse the judge’s decision. They argued that whereas in hospital Aquilina was receiving adequate treatment and was marking progress, his situation changed when he ended up at the unit, which was a “halfway” arrangement between a fully equipped hospital ward and a prison. About a month ago, Magistrate Farrugia upheld the defence’s request and ordered Aquilina back to the hospital, the only place where he could lawfully be held at that stage.  He was detained at the Multi-Purpose Unit, which consists of single rooms where patients are kept until they can be moved to other wards. This promoted a complaint from the nurses’ union, which said the unit was not equipped to handle patients like Aquilina and requested constant police backup.  In the absence of police protection, the union ordered its members to abandon the ward they were in if Aquilina was moved there.  Two police officers were eventually assigned to Aquilina but following his lawyer’s complaint, he was transferred to Division 5 at the Corradino Correctional Facility last week.

Title: Woman who rang magistrate gets a telling off in court
Body: A woman who rang up a magistrate hearing a case against her relative received a very public telling-off in court on Monday morning. Magistrate Ian Farrugia noted that he had received a call from a relative of Leonvic Fenech, who stands accused of assaulting a neighbour who asked for a car blocking his garage to be moved. Farrugia said the relative used to be a client of his when he was a lawyer, before he became a magistrate, and that he hung up as soon as he realised who he was speaking to. He rebuked the woman, who was seated in the courtroom, in strong terms and told her that while he was letting her off with a warning, he would not be so lenient if it were to happen again. The woman appeared contrite and apologised to the court. Lawyers representing the prosecution, defence and parte civile all placed it on the court record that they have full faith in the magistrate and want him to continue hearing the case. Fenech, a 23-year-old tow truck driver from Santa Venera, faces charges of grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving in relation to the October 7, 7am incident. On Monday, the courtroom heard from Fenech’s alleged victim, who testified that he had rung Fenech’s doorbell after finding a car parked in front of his garage. This was a regular occurrence and it did not overly bother him, he said. He said that Fenech had opened the door and told him that he did not know who owned the car blocking his garage. The victim however insisted that it belonged to someone living in Fenech’s home. Fenech is then alleged to have shoved the victim, told him to “leave me alone so I can sleep” and then attacked him with an iron bar used to lever a hydraulic jack.  He was hit on his right leg, causing him grievous injuries. The commotion prompted a small crowd to gather, the victim said, and Fenech had then hopped into his tow truck and driven off, only to return and attempt to run him over. The victim said he had jumped into a recessed doorway to avoid being hit by the truck. Some time later, police arrived and Fenech was placed under arrest. The victim told the court that he believed the car blocking his garage belonged to a relative of Fenech’s who was present in the courtroom. Upon hearing this, the magistrate asked the witness to identify the man. He then summoned the car owner to the bench and gave him a dressing down and said parking in front of a person’s garage and then being reluctant to move the car was behaviour more fitting for the “Stone Age”. At the end of his testimony, the victim told the court that he did not want his neighbour to be unduly punished and just wanted to go back to having a good relationship with Fenech. Fenech requested bail and the court agreed to that request, subject to him posting a €1,000 deposit and a €2,000 personal guarantee, and signing a bail book on a weekly basis. Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa prosecuted, assisted by prosecutor Rebekah Spiteri. Lawyers Ishmael Psaila and Roberto Spiteri are defence counsel. Lawyer Franco Debono is appearing parte civile.

Title: Today's front pages – October 16, 2023
Body: The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Monday. All newspapers lead with news about a double murder that took place on Sunday in Triq it-Tiġrija, Marsa. Joe Bartolo known as il-Babakku, 73, and his 56-year-old partner Carmen Abela were killed in a garage.  Times of Malta also reports that Jamie Vella, who is facing criminal proceedings over his alleged involvement in two murders has demanded the recusal of presiding judge Edwina Grima because she has already heard the trial of one of the co-accused in the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop.  The Malta Independent and L-orizzont meanwhile refer to Prime Minister Robert Abela's comments on Sunday that the minimum wage should increase. In-Nazzjon on the other hand refers to comments by PN leader Bernard Grech, who on Sunday said COLA should be tax-free.

Title: EPPO chief wants Malta police to do more to support major fraud probes
Body: More police resources need to be dedicated to helping investigations into major fraud cases impacting the EU’s budgetary interests, the chief prosecutor has advised Malta. Laura Kövesi, who heads the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), was in Malta last week for talks on the problem with the Justice Ministry and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa. In comments to Times of Malta, Kövesi said that while detection and reporting of potential cases has improved, EPPO’s two Maltese prosecutors needed more police support to handle their investigations. “I came here to discuss a plan to develop this further. It is important to be consistent and efficient. Yes, the level of crime detection has increased, but this should not be random or because I came and criticised the authorities,” Kövesi said. Two years ago, Kovesi had stiff words about the way Maltese investigators passed the buck on who was responsible for probing EU fraud cases. Kövesi said that while the situation has improved, she gets a sense that police still draw a distinction between their cases and EPPO cases. “EPPO is not a foreign institution. I fear there is a distinction between ‘their cases and our cases’. No, EPPO is embedded in Malta. The two delegated prosecutors work here and prosecute cases in the Maltese court,” Kövesi said. She said that while there are “a few” police officials who have been officially designated to work on EPPO cases, this has to be done while the same officers juggle their own caseloads in parallel. “This problem with the resources should not be so complicated. I can understand there are not enough police officers, but the idea is to have a plan and establish how to deal with this”. It is important that the EPPO team is not left alone, she added. She said some other countries have gone for a model where police officers are embedded full-time within the local EPPO office. The chief EU prosecutor argued that EPPO is the best possible tool to ensure countries have bigger budgets and more resources available to them, as its main role is to detect VAT and customs fraud. “The last estimates put VAT fraud at €50 billion, year after year, for decades. With EPPO, you can reduce that gap, and if we do that, it means more money in governments’ pockets. “In two years of operations, we have seized €700 million, money that will go directly back to the budgets of EU member states. If we seize a lot of money in Malta, this money will go back into the Maltese budget.” Kövesi also pointed out flaws in the way Malta legislators had adopted the EU’s regulations governing EPPO’s functions. The situation has seen EPPO investigators effectively locked out of magisterial inquiries, which take place in secret. “Our delegated prosecutors must lead the investigation, not the magistrate. It is in the regulations,” Kövesi said. Times of Malta revealed last year how an EPPO probe into the €40 million Marsa junction project faced obstacles, as both the police and an inquiring magistrate refused to hand over data from murder suspect Yorgen Fenech’s phone. Fenech was promised €2 million in success fees for helping a Turkish bidder on the verge of bankruptcy win the Marsa bid. Kövesi said the authorities have told her amendments to the law have been presented to parliament. EPPO publicly highlighted these “implementation gaps” in March. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard presented a draft law to increase EPPO’s power in December 2022, only to withdraw the bill from parliament the following month. Kövesi said collaboration between EPPO and the police had led to arrests in a “complex case” involving many suspects. In July, EPPO announced that eight people had been arrested in connection with customs fraud and corruption of public officials. Investigators suspect a fraudulent scheme designed to evade the payment of customs taxes and duties on the importation of clothing and other goods from China, by under-declaring their value and weight. The scheme is suspected to run into the millions of euros. Kövesi said the scale of the case, which involves lots of connections and transactions with other countries, was a difficult one to investigate. She acknowledged how the police had helped a lot on this particular investigation. “We also have other cases, and just two prosecutors to work on them. That means there need to be more police to support them, as all cases need to be worked on”, she said. She said that while the case in question was a big one for Malta, it was still “only one case”.

Title: Mental health crisis: just four child psychiatrists seeing 1,000 clients each
Body: Child psychiatrists are warning that thousands of children with mental health problems are falling through the cracks of a system that does not have enough therapists to keep up with the demand. Around 16,000 children and adolescents in Malta demonstrate symptoms of mental health problems, an ongoing study has revealed, and 15 per cent of them meet the criteria to be diagnosed with a mental disorder. Child psychiatrists Nigel Camilleri and Rosemarie Sacco told Times of Malta there are not enough professionals to deal with the demand and the government is doing very little to mitigate the situation. “There are just four child and adolescent psychiatrists in Malta and we have around 1,000 clients each at any one time,” Camilleri said on World Mental Health Day. “Ideally, we see each client every two weeks but with the caseload we have that’s impossible. I have an eight-month waiting list of new patients. In comparison, our counterparts in the UK have some 100 clients each at any one time.”   He said the Association of Child and Adolescent Mental Health had flagged the issue several times with the government, but there was no “genuine investment”. Child mental health services continued to suffer from insufficient staff, lack of training and inadequate and dilapidated facilities at St Luke’s Hospital, where the department is based. “Lime plaster falls off the walls, the furniture is old and mismatched, plumb­ing is poor… we’ve had teenage patients ask us why they are forced to receive treatment in such an ugly environment,” Camilleri said.   The association, of which Sacco and Camilleri are the president and the social policy officers respectively, is currently leading research which has shown that two out of every five children and adolescents aged between five and 16 show symptoms of mental health problems. Some 15 per cent of them meet the criteria to be diagnosed with a disorder. The study is part-funded by the Voluntary Organisation Project Scheme (VOPS). The figures are at par with those of other countries, however, Malta’s mental health structure remains severely limited. Therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists are leaving the state service and are not being replaced, and most of those who remain feel helpless and overworked. “We need to employ more doctors and professionals from abroad, like we’re doing with all other services and industries,” Camilleri said. Three-quarters of all mental disorders begin before the age of 25, so it is crucial to address them at the earliest possible stage. He warned that if Malta did not take mental health issues in children seriously it risked suffering the consequences in 50 years’ time. Sacco added this meant that in future, Malta risked a higher number of unhappier adults with lower self-esteem, who would have dropped out of school earlier, found it harder to retain jobs and engaged in criminal behaviour.   The cost of dealing with the consequences would be “far greater and more devastating” than if we had addressed mental health problems in childhood now. Sacco and Camilleri acknowledged that the government had drawn up a mental health strategy and had promised to move children's services to the community. However, neither the plan nor the move were implemented, as “there is no plan”. “We are stuck, we are not moving forward. And we are not even using the resources we have creatively enough to be more productive,” Camilleri added. “The mental health of children is a public health priority, and we need to start off by raising awareness on good mental health,” Camilleri said.

Title: From exotic animals to art: €51.5m assets seized from crime suspects last year
Body: The Asset Recovery Bureau, the agency responsible for confiscating criminals’ assets, seized more than €51.5 million worth of property and other valuable goods last year, a €20 million increase over the previous year. This amount includes some €10.2 million seized in collaboration with the police in six cases they were investigating. The seized assets include nearly €47 million worth of immovable property, nearly €2 million worth of tools, industrial equipment and material, €1.7 million worth of vehicles, €620,000 worth of furniture and domestic goods, €430,000 in nautical vessels, €142,000 worth of works of art, antiques, books and melitensia, and €72,000 worth of stocks which include spirits. Moreover, €51,000 worth of exotic animals, €20,000 in jewellery, €6,700 worth of weapons and just over €1,000 in clothing were also seized. These assets were seized from 88 locations in Malta and Gozo, according to the bureau’s annual report. The bureau assisted the police in six cases in 26 of the locations, which together saw the seizure of almost €8.9 million worth of immovable property, €932,000 worth of vehicles, €230,000 in domestic goods, almost €51,000 worth of exotic animals, €2,000 in works of art and €16,000 worth of jewellery.  The bureau reported an “exponential increase” in the number of cases it was involved in, as well as in the complexity of assets held by people in the criminal world. This forced the bureau to increase its human resources to broaden its expertise in exotic animals, weapons, accounting and stock management, industrial equipment, books and melitensia.  During 2022, the bureau saw an “upward trend” in all types of court orders it processed, including freezing orders, variations orders and cancellation orders. Commenting on crimes that lead to the seizure of assets, the bureau said that drug-related offences continued to be the most prevalent, followed by money laundering cases. Throughout 2022, the bureau was heavily involved in the provision of international assistance and cooperation to law enforcement and asset recovery offices fighting crime across multiple jurisdictions. The number of requests received by the Maltese office steadily increased from 13 in 2019 to 64 in 2022. In terms of frozen assets by the ARB in 2022, immovables represented the largest portion, with a value of almost €16 million, followed by bank accounts holding a total of €1.3 million and vehicles worth a total of €960,000. Another €624,000 worth of unregistered assets, nautical vessels and investments were also frozen in the year under review. The ARB’s Asset Management Unit requires ample space to store and maintain seized assets so the bureau reached joint collaborative agreements with several other governmental entities and various museums to protect, store and maintain seized and confiscated cultural assets and specific works of art. Such assets are transferred for temporary safekeeping and storage to various museums, while they are displayed for public viewing and cultural appreciation. To address the problem of space, the bureau is building a new compound in Ħal Far to securely store assets recovered from crime. Built on a footprint of 1,320 square metres, the building will preserve assets recovered from criminal activities, including jewellery, works of art, boats, trailers and cars. The building will have five floors and an underground basement. The first floor will be dedicated to offices while a goods lift will be capable of lifting passenger cars and small trucks from the basement to the fourth floor.

Title: Sliema double murder: victims’ brothers devastated as trial is put off
Body: The families of two murdered men are “devastated” and “extremely disappointed” at how the alleged murderer has “managed to dodge” his trial meant to begin on Monday. Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski – the brothers of murdered men Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski – spoke to Times of Malta shortly after Daniel Muka’s trial was postponed to April. He has objected to being represented by a State-funded lawyer. “We have to emotionally prepare ourselves each time we go to court and each delay adds so much more unnecessary heartache,” Maciejowski said. “We all desperately need closure.”   Pandolfino said that, three years ago, when his brother was murdered, he had to break the horrible news to his mother and father and he had to do it again yesterday. “When my brother was murdered, my parents were 84 and it was the hardest thing I had to do in my life,” he said. “Today, they’re 87 and I had to go back to them and tell them they won’t see justice for now. I’m worried that, like Daphne Caruana Galizia’s mother, they too will not have enough time to see justice done. They have every right to achieve closure on their son’s brutal murder.”   The couple were fatally shot in what investigators believe may have been a botched robbery in 2020 involving three men. Albanian Daniel Muka, 28, allegedly pulled the trigger. Muka was already a suspect in an audacious 2017 jewellery heist in which he allegedly tried to shoot two policemen during his arrest. Maciejowski – who purposely flew in with his family from the UK for the trial – said that, while his family was extremely grateful for the hard work of law enforcement on the case, they were baffled as to how the Maltese legal system allowed Muka to “dodge justice” once again.  Ivor (right) with his parents. Photo: Family photo   The trial had been scheduled to start last May. Back then, he had also changed his lawyer, forcing the court to postpone the trial to yesterday, to give his new, legal aid lawyer enough chance to work the case. Pandolfino also praised the work of law enforcement and said he understood the judge had his hands tied. However, he fears the accused is using delaying tactics to be released on bail again.   “No wonder court cases in Malta take forever to be decided,” Pandolfino said. “The longer this case drags out, the less likely it is that the killer will be brought to justice. Look what happened with the case of Albert Rosso – the two men were acquitted and justice failed him. Doesn’t this country learn anything from past mistakes?” What if, in April, Muka again says he does not trust his new lawyer, Pandolfino asked. “Will this go on forever? If any other criminal out there follows his lead, all the court cases that already take ages will be further delayed. All they have to do is say they don’t have faith in their lawyer at the last minute.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: German court jails ex-skinhead over deadly 1991 arson
Body: A German court Monday sentenced a former skinhead to nearly seven years in jail over a 1991 arson attack on a shelter for asylum seekers that killed a Ghanaian man. The attack in Saarlouis remained unsolved for decades as one of Germany's most prominent extremist cold cases before the probe was relaunched in 2020 after new evidence emerged.  The superior regional court in the western city of Koblenz ordered a jail term of six years and 10 months for the 52-year-old defendant identified only as Peter S. in line with German privacy rules.  Twenty years old and thus a minor at the time of the crime, he received a juvenile sentence for the charges which also included attempted murder and aggravated arson. Presiding judge Konrad Leitges said the defendant, who listened to the verdict with a slightly bowed head, acted "based on his right-wing extremist beliefs, due to hatred of foreigners".   The court found that in the early hours of September 19, 1991, Peter S. poured petrol at the entrance to the refugees' accommodation before setting it alight.  The fire spread rapidly up the stairwell, engulfing 27-year-old Ghanaian Samuel Yeboah, who died the same day, after suffering serious burns and smoke inhalation. "His death was excruciating and took a long, long time," Leitges said. Two residents saved themselves by jumping out of the window, suffering broken bones. The remaining 18 reached safety uninjured. Leitges said Peter S. came from a troubled home and "sought a replacement family" in the skinhead scene around Saarlouis from the early 1990s and "completely uncritically" took on its ideology.  Peter S. was arrested in April 2022 and had since been held in pre-trial detention. He had bragged about the attack to a witness at a barbecue in 2007 saying, "I did it and they never caught me."  When the witness learned in 2019 that a person had been killed in the fire, she came forward. The judge thanked her for her "courageous" testimony. Prosecutors had demanded nine and a half years in prison while the defence team called for four and a half years. When the trial opened in November 2022, left-wing groups held a rally against the infamous attack being forgotten.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Minister asks Chamber of Advocates to investigate revolving door claims
Body: Updated 5pm, adds government statement The Justice Minister has formally written to the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators asking them to investigate reports that the justice minister had not acted on recommendations by an inquiry he appointed three years ago to prevent "revolving door situations". Following the reports, a statement was issued by the Nationalist Party saying that the fact that a prosecuting lawyer at the Attorney General's Office was now working in the defence team of the Degiorgio brothers showed that the justice minister had not acted on the inquiry recommendations. Shadow Minister Karol Aquilina recalled that in June 2020 a board of inquiry appointed by Minister Jonathan Attard and headed by retired chief justice Joseph Azzopardi recommended that lawyers leaving the AG's office should not represent persons or companies which the AG's office would have started proceedings against. The inquiry was opened after lawyer Charles Merceica moved from the Attorney General's office to the defence team of Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of masterminding the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. But last week another former AG lawyer, George Camilleri, filed a judicial protest on behalf of the Degiorgio brothers against the prisons CEO. The brothers are serving time after admitting their role in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and have other pending cases.  The Nationalist Party asked what action Justice Minister Jonathan Attard had taken since he received the inquiry report. What action had been taken by Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to avoid cases such as this?   What changes had been made in the code of ethics of lawyers after the inquiry? Who would shoulder political responsibility in the latest case?    Aquilina said the justice minister and the attorney general should no longer abdicate their responsibilities because the message they were getting across through their actions was that people who had the money could freely buy the services of lawyers who until recently would have been leading proceedings against them.  In a statement, the Justice Ministry denied that no action had been taken following the inquiry. He said that any breach of ethics could be investigated by the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators either ex officio or when a breach was pointed out by someone. So earlier on Monday, he formally wrote to the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators asking them to investigate the reports. The ministry said that the inquiry had led to the introduction of a number of measures, both contractual but also ethical, to provide for a revolving door situation. A clause had been introduced for Attorney General employees not to appear for private clients or enter negotiations to become defence lawyers of private clients, personally or through third parties, while they are still AG employees Prosecutors within the AG's office should not, before the termination of their employment, make arrangements or preparations to act on behalf of people against whom prosecutions would be led by the AG or about whom the AG would have given advice or presented judicial acts, the ministry said.

Title: Five youths being questioned about motorcycle thefts
Body: Five youths were rounded up by the police and taken to a police station for questioning in connection with motorcycle thefts in various localities on Friday evening. The police were tipped off about a group of young people who were setting fire to objects in a field in Żabbar. Acting on information received, the police rounded up the youths in a field in Misraħ San Nikola in Ħaż-Żabbar. The group consisted of two 18-year-olds, one from Birżebbuġa and the other from Valletta, a 16 and 14-year-old from Żabbar and a fourteen-year-old from Cospicua. While on site, the police discovered motorcycles that had been reported stolen in the previous days and soon the police realised the youths matched the descriptions of those who had stolen the bikes. Further searches on another site led to more motorbikes that had also been reported as stolen. The youths were taken to a police station for questioning. Police investigations are underway.

Title: Six suspects in assassination of Ecuador presidential candidate killed
Body: Six suspects in the August assassination of Ecuador presidential candidate and anti-corruption crusader Fernando Villavicencio were killed in prison on Friday, officials said. The SNAI prisons authority initially announced that "an event occurred" in the Guayas 1 prison in Guayaquil "resulting in six dead people." It later clarified the deceased were "of Colombian nationality and accused of the murder of former presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio." Villavicencio, a 59-year-old journalist, was gunned down as he left a campaign rally in the capital Quito days ahead of the first round vote. After news broke of the prison deaths, Ecuadoran President Guillermo Lasso announced he would immediately return from an international trip to handle the incident. Lasso had traveled to New York on Thursday for personal matters, and was due in Seoul on Saturday for official trade talks. "In the next few hours I will return to Ecuador to attend to this emergency. Neither complicity nor cover-up, here the truth will be known," Lasso said on X, formerly Twitter. The public prosecutor's office said that its agents, along with police and the military, were "executing security protocols... in light of the disturbance that occurred Friday afternoon." It added in a statement on X that "in the coming hours, specialized military personnel will carry out the first raids and reconnaissance of Cellblock 7, where the incidents originated, to take control of the situation."   Guayas 1 is one of five facilities that make up a large prison complex in Guayaquil, a key port city that has become one of the country's increasingly bloody centers of a turf war between rival drug-trafficking gangs.  In late July, a riot in the Guayas 1 prison left more than 30 people dead. The assassination of Villavicencio, who had been polling in second place, rocked Ecuador days ahead of national elections in which corruption and the country's declining security situation were major themes. Six Colombians with long criminal records were arrested shortly after, while a seventh was killed at the scene of the crime. Villavicencio had carried out scores of investigations, including exposing a vast graft network which led to former president Rafael Correa being sentenced to eight years in prison. Correa fled the country to avoid jail time and has been exiled in Belgium for six years. Villavicencio had drawn the ire of gangs and drug traffickers with his reputation for speaking out against the cartels, many of which operate out of prisons across Ecuador. More than 430 inmates have died violently since 2021, dozens of them dismembered and incinerated amid disputes between rival gangs. In late August, dozens of guards were taken hostage at several prisons around the country before eventually being released. On Ecuador's streets, homicides have quadrupled between 2018 and 2022, climbing to a record 26 per 100,000 inhabitants. That rate could climb as high as 40 this year, according to experts. Ecuador was once a peaceful haven nestled between the world's largest cocaine producers -- Colombia and Peru. However, the war on drugs in other South American nations displaced drug cartels to Ecuador, which has large Pacific ports with laxer controls, widespread corruption, and a dollarized economy. The prisons crisis has become a key point of debate ahead of the second round election on October 15, between leftist lawyer Luisa Gonzalez and 35-year-old upstart Daniel Noboa. Noboa has proposed leasing ships to hold the country's most violent prisoners offshore.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Jonathan Ferris awarded €20,000 over unjustified dismissal
Body: Jonathan Ferris’ claims that he was discriminated against and unjustly dismissed from his managerial post at the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) were vindicated by a tribunal that awarded him €20,000 in compensation. The former police inspector, whose name is synonymous with several major financial crime investigations, had taken up the position of Head of Unit at the FIAU on November 1, 2016.  But his new employment was short-lived.   RELATED STORIES  On June 16, 2017, he was fired during the probation period following a unanimous decision by the Board of Governors on the recommendation of the FIAU director. In a statement issued after that dismissal, the FIAU claimed the decision was “based solely on an objective and comprehensive performance assessment.” But Ferris claimed otherwise, insisting that that decision was politically motivated and that such discriminatory treatment in his regard was not acceptable in a democratic society.  He filed proceedings against the FIAU before the Industrial Tribunal. The FIAU claimed that Ferris’s arguments were frivolous and not proven. Moreover, since his termination had taken place during probation, that decision could not be reviewed in terms of law.  According to former chair of the FIAU board Peter Grech, the industrial dispute registered by Ferris was nothing but an attempt “to force an investigation into what had led to the termination”. The tribunal had to determine whether an employee could suffer discrimination during probation and whether this was so in Ferris’s case.  When delivering its decision on Friday, chair Anna Mallia observed that during probation an employer cannot do as he pleases simply because the employee is still on trial.  Rather, he must make sure that the newcomer is performing his duties well. He should offer the employee all support and assistance necessary to help him integrate into the new work environment rather than subject him to discrimination or victimisation by way of a strategy leading to his dismissal.  Did Ferris suffer discrimination during probation? Ferris claimed that there were “political reasons” behind his dismissal and hence, he suffered discrimination.  On the basis of the evidence put forward, the tribunal upheld that claim, observing that Ferris’ colleagues at the FIAU had not faced the same fate.  Trouble appeared to brew when FIAU reports about suspected financial wrongdoing at the now-shuttered Pilatus Bank were leaked to the media.  That was when Ferris was no longer trusted, unlike fellow officials, including three new analysts, who shared the same common password as Ferris.  In fact, the whole team shared that password, although the system could detect any login and any changes effected thereto.  Yet, all suspicions fell upon Ferris as the one who had leaked those reports.  On May 2, 2017, two days after seeing the Pilatus report drawn up by the compliance analyst, Ferris was instructed to steer clear of any investigations concerning the bank.  His superiors claimed that he had a conflict of interest since he had investigated and arrested former Pilatus employee, Maria Efimova, for alleged fraud against the bank. However, he was still to retain his position as Head of Unit, Ferris was told.  But after that date, he was sidelined in all FIAU discussions concerning politically exposed persons.  Other members of the team were not.  The tribunal failed to understand how the FIAU claimed not to be satisfied with Ferris’ performance, yet at the same time kept him on as Head of Unit, even when the leaks began.  He was also deemed sufficiently trustworthy to represent the regulator both locally and abroad, sometimes accompanied by those same people who later certified that he did not perform well.  Nor was it proven that he had leaked those reports because he was not the only person at FIAU who had access to them.  It was not proven that “sensitive” records had not been taken away by others who preceded Ferris at FIAU.  The first report about Pilatus bank was not prepared by Ferris and the one concerning Adrian Hillman was done before his time.  Another report on suspected kickbacks between Hillman and former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri was only handed to Ferris to sign when he first joined the FIAU.  Two reports about Schembri completed in June 2016 and November 2016 were passed on to the police, but Ferris only signed the second one.  He also did not draw up the report on former minister Konrad Mizzi and the board never convened to decide whether to forward it to the police.  As for another report about the LNG tanker, it was only signed by Ferris and not finalised by the FIAU board.  After considering each of those reports, the tribunal concluded that there was no proof that they had been leaked by Ferris. When all was considered his dismissal was deemed discriminatory and unjustified, said the tribunal and based on Ferris’s gross salary, annual increments and performance bonuses, awarded him €20,000 compensation.  Lawyers Andrew Borg Cardona, Jason Azzopardi and Eve Borg Costanzi assisted Ferris.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man accused of assaulting his partner, locking her up
Body: A man who allegedly assaulted and then locked up his partner after a row over a deleted phone message was taken to court on Sunday and remanded in custody. A magistrate heard that the argument broke out at about 2am on Friday when the man, Tyler Camilleri, 24, wanted to know what was behind a Facebook message which was received by his partner and deleted by the sender. She had tried to explain that the sender was a friend on Facebook and the message was harmless. But matters escalated and the woman was allegedly beaten on her face and head, suffering slight injuries. She was then locked up for hours in the house in Zejtun she shared with her partner. The woman, whose name cannot be published by court order, managed to contact her mother and she was rescued by her mother’s partner, who climbed over a wall to get access to the locked house. She was then examined at Paola health centre. While she was there her partner showed up and tried to get to her by telling the security officer that he was her brother, but her mother told the officer that her daughter had no siblings. A police report was then filed. Camilleri was accused of injuring his partner, holding her against her will and causing her to fear violence. He was also accused of breaking the conditions of a probation order and being a recidivist. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecution objected to a request for bail in view of the accused's record, saying he could not be trusted, Prosecutors also pointed to the seriousness of the case and the fact that civilians still had to testify. The defence argued that the witnesses should have been presented immediately, pointing out that up to some time ago, such cases used to be summarily heard and concluded in one sitting. Now a person with a steady job who needed to support his family ended up having to undergo a lengthy process.  It was also pointed out that the accused had suffered a knife wound by the alleged victim. Magistrate Gianella Camilleri Busuttil refused bail but ordered the prosecution to produce its witnesses at the next sitting. Inspector Audrey Micallef prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Police still looking for fugitives Jomic Calleja Maatouk and his wife Marzia
Body: The police are still looking for Jomic Calleja Maatouk, who was convicted of importing explosives, almost a month since he was placed on Europol’s list of Europe’s most wanted fugitives, sources have confirmed. The Maltese police are collaborating with their European counterparts in an attempt to find Calleja Maatouk and his wife Marzia. Malta has already issued European Arrest Warrants for the couple, while Jomic Calleja Maatouk was also placed on Europol’s list of Europe’s most wanted fugitives. According to the latest intelligence, the couple is believed to have absconded from Malta, probably by sea, since no official sea and air departures list included their names. “We are in constant contact with our colleagues around Europe because although we believe they are in Serbia, they might have moved to nearby countries,” police sources told Times of Malta. Serbia has an extradition agreement with Malta.   The police believe the Calleja Maatouks either used false passports to get out of the country or crossed to Sicily by sea and then drove through Italy northwards. Jomic Calleja Maatouk, 36, was sentenced to five years in jail after he was convicted of importing explosives and trying to buy poison. He must also serve a prison sentence over drug offences. He was out on bail after he appealed his conviction but did not sign a bail book for a number of days. In court, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech had described him as a “lethal weapon” who was ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk had been caught trying to import deadly material that included lethal doses of radioactive material Polonium-210, highly toxic poison Ricin, killer drug Fentanyl and C-4 explosives.   His wife, 23-year-old Marzia, was in July sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted of cannabis possession with intent. The crime took place in August 2019 when she was just 19. Soon after her disappearance, Marzia’s family told Times of Malta they were fearing for her safety after the couple’s home was found in a mess. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the family said Marzia has not been online on WhatsApp, and calls to her mobile phone were returning voicemail messages that appeared to indicate it has been switched off for days. Her brother was the first to sound the alarm when his sister did not show up at his shop to cover a shift and was not taking his calls. “We are extremely worried she might have been forced to leave the country and that she might be in danger right now,” one tearful relative had told Times of Malta. Jomic Calleja Maatouk has a long criminal record as well as a history of fleeing the law. In 2015 he was arrested aboard a train in Sicily heading to the Italian mainland, having left Malta as he faced criminal proceedings related to cannabis trafficking.

Title: Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro in an 'irreversible coma' 
Body: Notorious Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, captured in January after three decades on the run, is in a coma in hospital and no longer being fed, media reports said Saturday.  The 61-year-old has been suffering from colon cancer for several years. It was his decision to seek treatment that led to his arrest following a visit to a clinic in the Sicilian capital Palermo. Facing numerous life sentences, he was detained in a high-security jail in L'Aquila, where he continued treatment in his cell, according to reports. But in early August, Messina Denaro was moved to the inmates ward of the local hospital, where his condition has declined in recent days. He is now in an "irreversible coma", according to media reports. Medics have stopped feeding him and he has asked not to be resuscitated. Messina Denaro was for many years a leading figure in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies. He was also one of its most ruthless bosses and was handed six life sentences over the years, including for his role in the murder of anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone in 1992. He was also found guilty of involvement in a string of deadly bombings in Rome, Florence and Milan in 1993, and the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the 12-year-old son of a witness in the Falcone case. Messina Denaro disappeared in the summer of 1993, and became the top name on Italy's most-wanted list. There was intense speculation in the years that followed about where he had gone. In the end, he was found to have been staying near his hometown of Castelvetrano in western Sicily. Investigators had been combing the Sicilian countryside for possible hideouts for years, wiretapping members of his family and his friends. They were heard discussing the medical problems of an unnamed person who suffered from cancer, as well as eye problems -- a person who detectives became sure was Messina Denaro. They used a national health system database to search for male patients of the right age and medical history, and eventually closed in. But while his arrest brought some relief for his victims, the mob boss always maintained his silence. In interviews in custody since being arrested, Messina Denaro even denied he was a member of the Cosa Nostra.

Title: From the Bench: You've been cancelled!
Body: A procedural notion which often goes unnoticed is the cancellation of a case following the parties’ failure to appear at trial. In any litigious cause, the two sides with a vested interest, i.e., plaintiff(s) who instituted the cause and defendant(s) against whom the cause was instituted, are expected to participate actively in the proceedings, which participation involves, at the very least, their presence during the trial. Article 199 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta) caters for those instances in which either both plaintiff and defendant, or the plaintiff, fail to make an appearance during a trial before the Superior or Inferior Courts. A judgment in which this procedural instrument was invoked due to the failure of appearance of both plaintiff and defendant was that in the names of Duncan Mizzi v. Keven Agbigbi, delivered on August 30, 2023 by the Rent Regulation Board. The parties’ non-appearance despite the case being called three times, led the board to order the cancellation of the cause from the list, at the plaintiff’s sole expense. When a cause is called three times and the defendant or his advocate appears but not the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s advocate, the defendant has the right to demand that the plaintiff be non-suited with costs, effectively discontinuing the proceedings. This is not to say that the plaintiff does not have a remedy in the event of cancellation of the cause following failure to appear. An application for restoration of the cause to the list needs to be filed within three months from the date of cancellation. Such a demand will only be met once, so the plaintiff and/or his legal counsel must ensure their presence at subsequent hearings of the trial. Having said that, the principle of cancellation of causes may not be invoked when a cause is awaiting the outcome of another cause. Despite the wording of Article 199 suggesting that the power to cancel a cause from the list is one which vests solely in the Superior and Inferior Courts, and not in boards, the board ascertained in its judgment of Mizzi v. Agbigbi, that the Reletting of Urban Property (Regulation) Ordinance grants the Rent Regulation Board the authority to exercise the powers vested in the Civil Court by Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta (of which the cancellation of causes due to default in appearance forms part via Article 199). In the judgment of Mizzi v. Agbigbi, after the cancellation of the cause from the list due to the parties’ failure to make an appearance, the plaintiff chose not to avail of his remedy granted by Article 199(3) of Chapter 12 to restore the cause to the list, for this to heard and determined upon the same acts. As a result, the Rent Regulation Board reaffirmed its decree whereby it had cancelled the cause at plaintiff’s expense, and lastly declared that it will not be taking further cognizance of the proceedings. This means that in view of plaintiff’s inaction to request the restoration of the cause within the three month window allowed by Article 199(3), plaintiff may not institute proceedings against the same defendant and on the same merits on which the cancelled cause was based. The judgment is still pending appeal before the Court of Appeal (Inferior Jurisdiction). Dr Nicole Vassallo is a junior associate at Azzopardi Borg and Associates Advocates.

Title: Former commissioner wanted probe into Valletta police fraud 'put away'
Body: A police sergeant who is facing criminal action for allegedly claiming undue extra duty payments has been described by his former superiors as an “upright” man who kept his subordinates “in check” and was “one of the best on duty". The officers were testifying on Wednesday in proceedings against PS Alexander Schembri, 56, and Joseph Debrincat, 64, formerly stationed at the Valletta police station. Investigations against them were triggered by an anonymous letter which landed on the desk of former CEO now Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa’ alleging that certain officers at Valletta were doing extra duties during normal work hours and were claiming payment for both. The matter was referred to then-Commissioner Lawrence Cutajar who requested a report. Subsequently, on the basis of the information received he held that there was no ground for further action and advised that the investigation was to be “put away,” Superintendent James Grech from the Economic Crimes Squad testified. But the Internal Audit and Investigations Department had proceeded with their investigation into the goings on at the Valletta district, checking all those officers who earned more than €10,000 in extra duties in one year. Some officers had received petty amounts of €20 or €30 spread over various months and those were deemed insignificant and having no criminal intent in those cases, explained Grech. But that was not the case in respect of others. Schembri, who was detail officer at the time - setting the schedules, assigning duties and confirming invoices including his own - stood out. There were times when he worked more than 24 hours in one day and some of the hours were not written down in the detail (work schedule) but were traced on the invoice books. Thus on April 17, 2019, he worked 32 hours and on July 30, 2019, he worked 27 hours in a day, said Grech. During a five-and-half-hour interrogation, Schembri did not have a proper explanation for those extra hours, saying that there may have been some “mistake.” Former Commissioner Cutajar testified that, from memory, he believed that it turned out that Schembri had been granted some time off in lieu. “Alex (Schembri) was one of the best I had on duty,” he continued, explaining that he would occasionally alert him to some upcoming event that would need more officers on duty. “But there was no need for me to tell him how to work out the detail,” added the former police chief. Under further questioning, he gave an overview of how extra duties were paid and how sometimes unpredictable circumstances could create a need for some duty officer to step in on extra duty. In that case, the payment would be classified as “revenue” and deposited in the state coffers rather than in the officer’s account. Former Assistant Commissioner Stephen Mallia, who at the time was in charge of Region A - Valletta, Qormi and Paola- testified that he was “surprised” when first told about the allegations during a meeting with the former commissioner. “Alex was an upright sergeant. He kept his subordinates in check. So naturally, someone might have been badly affected. At first I thought that this was some false allegation to get back at him [Schembri]” He said he had faced Schembri about the allegations. “Rest assured because there’s nothing in it. Everything is okay,” Schembri had insisted. Mallia also passed on to Assistant Commissioner Ramon Mercieca a chat handed to him by Schembri so that “if it was a false allegation, the truth would come out.” From then on, Mallia said he took a step back. It was not in his remit to investigate the matter which fell under his region. Asked by defence lawyer David Bonello, Mallia confirmed that at the time the allegations emerged, Schembri was also president of the Malta Police Association. A former superintendent stationed at Valletta for some nine months around the time of the allegations, when shown the anonymous letter testified that she had never seen it before and only heard about the allegations when summoned previously to the FCID. She was still learning the ropes when promoted in rank and took instructions from AC Mallia. But as for extra duties assignment, she mainly left that in the hands of detail officer Schembri “who was very well updated.” Together they attended pre-event meetings to figure out the manpower needed on the day. There were many events in the capital such as Festival Malta and Carnival, explained Maria Stella Attard. “But the detail officer was, in my opinion, excellent,” she went on. There were minor and recurring events which he handled alone, telling her “leave it to me.” Schembri would then email the detail to all units. But she “never, never” gave out instructions to the detail officer about extra duties, she said. Asked by the defence whether she had received any complaints in that regard, Attard said that there were a few from “some orderlies and some officers too.” The case continues. AG lawyers Maria Schembri and Etienne Savona prosecuted together with superintendent James Grech and inspector Christian Abela. Lawyer Lennox Vella was counsel to  Debrincat. Lawyers Joe Giglio and David Bonello appeared for Schembri. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Wife of ‘That ‘70s Show’ actor seeks divorce after rape sentence
Body: Actress Bijou Phillips filed for divorce from Danny Masterson less than two weeks after the former That ‘70s Show star was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for raping two women, US media reported Tuesday. The model and singer cited “irreconcilable differences” in her petition in a California court, celebrity news website TMZ reported. Masterson, found guilty in May of raping the two women in 2001 and 2003 at his home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, was sentenced on September 7 to 30 years to life in prison. The 47-year-old US actor, who has one child with Phillips, will not be able to seek parole until he is 77 years old. Phillips is seeking full custody of their daughter, aged nine, with visitation rights for Masterson, TMZ reported.  Her lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment by AFP. Phillips had stayed with Masterson through his two trials – the first was declared a mistrial last year after the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision. The jury in the retrial deadlocked on another rape charge against a third woman. That charge was dismissed. Masterson rose to fame with the 1998 launch of retro sitcom That ‘70s Show, where he played the character of Steven Hyde alongside fellow stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher. He co-starred again with Kutcher on Netflix’s The Ranch, but was fired in 2017 and written off the show after Los Angeles police confirmed they were investigating multiple rape allegations against the actor. The three women at the heart of the charges against Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time. Two of them said church officials had discouraged them from contacting law enforcement. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Van driver parks on double yellow line, then drives over policeman's foot
Body: A driver who parked his van on a double yellow line, blocking a neighbour’s garage, landed into further trouble when he drove over a policeman’s foot, a court heard on Monday. It all started on Saturday morning when a woman called the police to report that her neighbour’s Ford Transit van was blocking her garage. A police sergeant went to the street in Birzebbuga at around 11:15am, finding the van parked on a double yellow line. Its owner, 27-year old Etienne Buttigieg, claimed that he had some trouble with the vehicle and could not move it. But then the officer noted that the number plates on the van actually belonged to another vehicle. He ordered the driver not to move. But Buttigieg drove off, right over the sergeant’s foot, that was fractured in the incident. He was tracked down later on Sunday at a Zejtun farmhouse where police also found the van involved in the incident. Buttigieg was arrested and escorted to court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges for having allegedly attacked and violently resisted the police officer, insulting and threatening both the officer and the neighbour, grievously injuring the sergeant and failing to obey legitimate orders. He also denied driving in a dangerous, negligent and reckless manner, without a licence and third-party insurance cover as well as using number plates belonging to another vehicle. Buttigieg was under a probation order issued almost a year ago and was allegedly a recidivist. The prosecution strongly objected to his request for bail, pointing out the risk of tampering with evidence and the fact that the accused had several past brushes with the law. Moreover, no public officer should suffer such injuries while carrying out his duties, argued the prosecutors. The defence countered that this was an “unfortunate incident” and the accused was very sorry for what happened. He could move to his mother’s home for bail purposes. Magistrate Natasha Galea Sciberras refused bail. Inspectors Doriette Cuschieri and Jonathan Cassar prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Anthony Stellini were defence counsel.

Title: Court jails man for 30 years for 'barbaric' Marsa murder
Body: A man was jailed for 30 years on Monday after he admitted to a fatal stabbing in July 2022. Ali Mahy Ezzo Saeed, a Sudanese national, pleaded guilty to murdering a 21-year-old Egyptian, Mahmoud Adly Qasim Gouda, in Triq Felicjan Bilocca, Marsa on July 24. He had initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea in the Criminal Court presided over by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera just before the start of a trial by jury.  When delivering judgment the court observed that several eyewitnesses had described how the accused had "brutally" stabbed the white-skinned 20-year old victim "ten times" with a knife.  One of them later explained how he "felt himself going crazy" as he saw the attack.  The accused dealt the blows "all over" until the victim collapsed in pools of blood.  The witness blocked the accused's efforts to get away by grabbing him by the feet while the police were alerted.  Another witness recalled how the accused "mercilessly" stabbed the youth.  He drew a knife from a pouch inside his trousers and stabbed the victim twice on the back.  Then when the victim turned round, Ezzo Saeed stabbed him on the chest.  His heart was pierced in the frenzied attack.  Pathologists who conducted the autopsy later reported that the victim suffered "hypovolaemic shock" due to perforation of the left ventricle on the left side of his chest.  After stabbing the victim on the chest, the accused still went after him, stabbing him again in the stomach.  He was ultimately restrained by other witnesses as he tried to escape.  The court observed that the accused had been convicted of a number of contraventions since he came to Malta. He had "mercilessly" stabbed the victim, observed the judge. The court could not allow such behavour to go unchecked.  "What the accused did was nothing but a boundless barbaric act The accused carried a knife for no just reason whatsoever and simply pulled it out and used it to attack the victim.  At no point was the aggressor himself in danger.  The court said this was a "very ugly murder  and the accused must be well and truly punished." Although the accused had changed his not-guilty plea to an admission before the start of the trial, this was not at the earliest stages of the proceedings. He had, however, spared the court from wasting precious time and public funds.  That was to be taken into consideration when meting out punishment.  But the court needed to protect society.  Although wilful homicide carries a term of life imprisonment, in this case the circumstances merited a reduced punishment of 30-years, less the time spent under preventive custody.  The accused was also fined €116.47 as well as confiscation of all his property, both movable and immovable.  He must also cover all court expert expenses. During the compilation of evidence, a witness had described how he put his army training to good use when he ran after Saeed, caught him and disarmed him. He even dodged him when he flung the knife in his direction.  The witness, a Sierra Leone national had described how he went to Marsa to buy food when he saw the accused “throwing a punch at the deceased”. Both men were strangers to him but the minute he saw the accused pull out a knife, his military instinct kicked in. “As an ex-military soldier, when I see a knife I know what it means," the witness, Sesai Abdulla, explained, speaking in English while an Arab-speaking interpreter translated proceedings to the accused. After “the first two stabbings on the back,” there were two other blows on the victim’s chest and a fifth one on the right side of the abdomen, recalled Abdulla, gesturing to explain the location of the wounds. He dropped his foodstuffs and called the police but there was no reply. He then headed to the Marsa police station but found “no police”. As he rang the doorbell in vain, he heard a female voice directing him to the nearest police station at Ħamrun. Abdulla returned to the crime scene just in time to see the victim collapse near a parked delivery van, while the aggressor made his way through a narrow passage between some trees close by. “My friend, stay until the police come,” the witness told him. “How can I stay?” replied the man, whom the witness identified in court as the accused. “Yes, you have stabbed someone and you must stay until the police arrive,” insisted the witness. The man refused, waved his knife and lunged at him. But Abdulla dodged and hit back, he told the court. The man ran off and the witness and other people chased him. Abdulla said he grabbed the aggressor as he tried to clamber up a fence. He managed to lock his arm until he finally gave up and obeyed the order to put his knife back inside its case.  The witness said he felt “awful” as he watched the victim collapse, stretching his arms slowly forward as he lay on the ground, “a lot of blood” around him. “How can you stab your own brother? Even if he belongs to a different race,” remarked the witness. Even when Malta, he added, he would step in to save a life. “That is why I confronted the accused…I removed my shirt and tried to apply my safety precautions learnt in the army.” Another eyewitness, Nigerian national Mbali Mohammed, said: “I see one of my brothers fighting with one of my brothers. I told them to stop.” He clarified they were not actually ‘brothers’ and that he did not know their country of origin. As one pulled out a knife and stabbed the other, he shouted “stop!”. “He didn’t and he did it again,” he said, explaining that the victim was then stabbed in the upper right chest. Other people joined him in trying to break up the attack and then called an ambulance and the police as the aggressor ran away.  He said he grabbed a plastic object to defend himself against the armed man and ran after him. He was present when the accused was finally cornered and then handed over to the police. The victim fell to the ground, blood everywhere, as he and others tried to save him. “I felt sorry. When we saw him lying there, we decided to confront the accused.” He described the weapon as a long knife. “I saw it, real with my eyes…We tried to remove it so he would not kill another person.”  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Mexico extradites son of cartel kingpin 'El Chapo' to US
Body: Mexico on Friday extradited the son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to the United States to face narcotics charges, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as "El Raton" or "The Mouse," was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges linked to the fentanyl crisis plaguing the United States. His father was convicted in 2019 of running what was believed to be the world's biggest narcotics syndicate and is serving life in a supermax prison in the state of Colorado. Garland hailed the extradition as "the most recent step in the Justice Department's effort to attack every aspect of the cartel's operations." "The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic that has devastated too many communities across the country." The White House also lauded the extradition as part of "ongoing cooperation" with Mexico, a sign the administration of President Joe Biden is eager to get past the friction with Mexico over antinarcotics efforts. "We thank our Mexican counterparts for their partnership in working to safeguard our peoples from violent criminals," said the statement by Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, released by the White House. Cooperation between Mexican and US security forces plunged last year after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador disbanded a unit that had worked closely with US Drug Enforcement Administration agents for more than a quarter century. The Mexican leader had accused US agents of "abusive interference" in his country's affairs. After Guzman's conviction, several of his sons, collectively known as "the Little Chapos," inherited control of the Sinaloa Cartel, US authorities said. Security agents captured the younger Guzman in the Sinaloa city of Culiacan on January 5. The operation to capture the younger Guzman resulted in 29 deaths, including 10 military personnel and 19 alleged criminals in clashes and mayhem as cartel members tried to free him. Cartel members set vehicles on fire, an echo of the massive shootouts in 2019 when the younger Guzman was briefly detained but then freed to avoid bloodshed. At the time, US authorities had a $5 million bounty for his arrest, accusing him and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, of overseeing methamphetamine labs in Sinaloa state producing an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pounds of meth per month. "Other information indicates that Ovidio Guzman Lopez has ordered the murders of informants, a drug trafficker, and a popular Mexican singer who had refused to sing at his wedding," according to a website of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ovidio Guzman, 33, will spend his first nights in a US prison just as his father's wife, Emma Coronel, walks free. Coronel, who is not Guzman's mother, was released from a California halfway house this week after completing a sentence for collaborating with Chapo Guzman in his narcotics activities. Coronel is a dual US-Mexican citizen. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Gozo Pride march assault should be treated as hate crime - Cyrus Engerer
Body: The Police Commissioner and the Home Affairs Ministry should treat an assault that took part after the Gozo Pride march on Saturday as a hate crime, Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer said on Friday.  Engerer was speaking during the third and final day of the LGBTIQ+ Human Rights Conference, organised as part of Europride.  Following the Gozo Pride march on Saturday, a man was assaulted when he tried to buy a drink from a bar. In an account issued to the media on Thursday, the victim said one of the bar’s patrons sprinted towards him and punched his face and head.  “What happened in a bar in Gozo shows how much we still need to work to ensure that hate is eliminated from these islands,” Cyrus said in his opening speech.  “The Police Commissioner and the Home Affairs Minister must treat this assault as a hate crime against a group of LGBTIQ people celebrating their pride in Gozo last week.” Speaking to Times of Malta, a police source said the police received a call early on Sunday morning at around 1.30am informing them of an argument that broke out. When they went on site, they found the victim.  The source said the case is being treated as aggression but investigations are being carried out to find the aggressor (who fled the scene) and the motive behind the attack. Engerer said that while Malta is known to have the best LGBTIQ laws in Europe, it does not mean there is equality on the island. A close friend and his partner, who is a third country national, will not be taking part in Saturday’s Pride March because of the discrimination they had to suffer. “The partner experiences discrimination every day. He is gay but he is not white or European, he lives in Malta and is only defined as a third-country national.” Engerer said human rights are universal, and should not be seen as a luxury or a privilege.  “Our rights are not granted by politicians or governments, but they are ours,” he added, and it is the government’s job to protect such rights.  “Until we are all equal, none of us are…" For his opening speech, Engerer was wearing a t-shirt with a message of solidarity with the El Hiblu 3.  The El Hiblu 3 - Amara, Kader, and Abdalla- were among a group of 108 migrants crossing from Libya in a dinghy when they were rescued by the merchant vessel El Hiblu 1 in 2019. International human rights advocates are calling on the attorney general to drop terrorism charges against the three young men, who are accused of commandeering a ship and threatening its crew after they were rescued at sea.    Opposition Speaker for Equality Graziella Attard Previ also deplored the assault that took place last weekend.  “The community cannot fully enjoy the universal human rights that are offered to them on paper when they run the risk of hate crime and hate speech on social media,” she said. She said being part of the LGBTIQ+ community is not all about pride, partying and having fun, but also about remembering and fighting for those who suffer in silence, who are afraid of homophobic actions and being discriminated against.  “While the younger generation is more open about their sexuality, we cannot forget the elderly and middle-aged groups who are still in the closet,” she added.  Following a discussion "Pride Under Attack", one of the panelists, Ukrainian activist and organiser of Kyiv Pride Edward Reese, was gifted a Gilbert Baker Flag.  Artist Gilbert Baker designed the first rainbow flag back in 1978. Years later, the flag is still proudly displayed as a symbol of the LGBTQ rights movement and Pride.    It was explained that the flag was produced in 2003 for the flag's 25th anniversary and was later cut up into small pieces and handed out to cities where LGBTIQ+ communities continue to fight for their rights.  President of the Gilbert Baker Foundation Charley Beal and the US Embassy’s Public Affairs Officer Elizabeth Canellakis presented the flag to Reese as a message of hope to Ukraine, and in support of LGBTIQ+ civilians fighting in the war. Parliamentary Secretary for Reforms and Equality Rebecca Buttigieg closed off the conference.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Italian police find stolen treasures at Australian museum
Body: Italian art detectives have found stolen ancient treasures at a leading Australian university, including an artefact likely smuggled out of the country under piles of pasta, the institution said Friday. Australian National University (ANU) said Friday it was working with the "specialist art squad" of Italy's Carabinieri military police to return the priceless pieces. The looted works discovered within the university's classics museum included a 2,500-year-old amphora depicting Greek champion Heracles fighting the mythical Nemean lion. Italian police discovered an old Polaroid photo of the Heracles vase while investigating an unnamed art thief, which led them to believe it had been illegally plundered before it was sent to Australia. The Canberra university said it had bought the vase in "good faith" at a Sotheby's auction in 1984, and was "proud" to work with Italian investigators to see it returned to its rightful home. Museum curator Georgia Pike-Rowney described the vase, which dates back to 530 BC, as a "stunning example" of ancient Mediterranean craftsmanship. Working in tandem with the museum, the Carabinieri also identified a stolen red fish plate from the Italian region of Apulia which they were able to trace to David Holland Swingler, an American art trafficker and food importer known for a culinary modus operandi. "During trips to Italy, Swingler sourced material directly from tombaroli - literally 'tomb robbers' who undertake illegal excavations," Pike-Rowney said. She added that Swingler "then smuggled the items to the US hidden among bundles of pasta and other Italian foods". Spurred to undertake its own audit, the Australian National University subsequently found a Roman marble head that belonged to a separate collection owned by the Vatican. "Conversations about the repatriation of ancient artefacts have become prominent in recent years, as institutions across the world grapple with the legacies of historical collection practices," said Pike-Rowney. "As Australia's national university, ANU must be at the forefront of best practice in managing restitution and repatriation cases." Italy's government has agreed to loan the vase and the fish plate to the university until they are returned at a "future date".

Title: Man found guilty of trying to export stuffed protected birds
Body: A Dutch national was fined €7,000 and suspended from obtaining wildlife trade licenses for three years on Monday after he was found guilty of attempting to export several stuffed protected birds.  The court also ordered the confiscation of 15 birds of different species which were found in the man's suitcase by customs officials as he tried to leave the country. The birds were found in a box checked as bulky luggage during security checks at the airport earlier in September as the man attempted to fly to the UK, with the majority belonging to a protected species, according to the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA). "The contents of the box raised the suspicion of Airport Security personnel who passed it through an X-ray machine and alerted ERA officials," said ERA in a statement.  "Upon examining the contents in the presence of customs officers, ERA officials determined that the majority were protected species originating from Northern Europe, Africa and South America." The man's arrest and tracing of the birds was the result of joint investigations by ERA, police, customs and Malta International Airport security, the authority said.     Reacting to the judgement, environmental and conservation NGO Birdlife Malta said the case was "proof of the worrying situation of illegal hunting in Malta and abroad by Maltese hunters", who it said were successfully managing to smuggle animal carcasses in and out of the country.  "Taxidermists in Malta, some of whom organise these hunting trips abroad, are actually illegally mounting these into stuffed birds for collections and illegal trade," the group wrote on Facebook.  Describing illegal hunting in Malta and abroad as "well-organised crime", Birdlife Malta said there had been a "massive push in changing laws to soften enforcement of taxidermy in particular. "The continued pressure by the hunting lobby to dilute and dismantle legal protection and to institutionalise loopholes in the same laws is evidently motivated by the same interest. "While the apprehension of one culprit is a one-off, the trade of illegally shot-protected birds in Malta is a very common activity and is the main reason why hunters are eager to shoot down protected birds all year round," the NGO said.  In June, European environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius said the European Commission (EC) was “left without a choice” but to take legal action against Malta over bird hunting and trapping. “Unfortunately, Malta did not prohibit (hunting and trapping) and that left the Commission without a choice but to refer Malta to the European Court of Justice,” he said.  Two years ago, the EC took Malta to the European Court of Justice for violating a ban on finch trapping. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Stolen Van Gogh returned in IKEA bag 'damaged but restorable'
Body: The precious Vincent Van Gogh painting stolen then sensationally returned to a Dutch art sleuth in an Ikea bag has been scratched but should be reparable, its museum director told AFP Wednesday. Thieves snatched the Van Gogh masterpiece "Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring" in the middle of the night in 2020 while the painting was on loan to a museum near Amsterdam from its home at the Groninger Museum in the northern Netherlands.  The painting, worth up to €6 million, was then returned on Monday to Arthur Brand, known as the "Indiana Jones" of the art world for his work in researching and recovering stolen artworks.    Brand took possession of the painting bound in bubble wrap, a pillow case and stuffed in a blue Ikea bag, but the work still appears to have sustained some damage.  "It is damaged by scratches so it's not in a perfect state but it's restorable," Groninger Museum director Andreas Bluhm told AFP in an interview. "When it's there in the IKEA bag, of course it was hot, so this is not ideal. It had already suffered for three and a half years," he said, adding: "But then bringing it in that same bag is quite safe because it's the least conspicuous way of moving it. Nobody would suspect anything." The painting is now at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where it is being examined, he said, adding that it could be some time before the work is available to the public.  "Even the restorer cannot tell you how long it will take. Probably months rather than weeks," he said.  What offers some hope for a successful restoration is that Van Gogh painted the work on paper glued to a thick wooden panel, rather than on canvas, so scratches should be superficial. Bluhm said the time between the robbery and the recovery had been a rollercoaster of emotions. The piece had never before left his museum, so its theft came as a hammer blow.  "The painting is part of our museum's identity and our collective collection. So that hurt even more," he said.  Then came news last Thursday of a possible return, giving him sleepless nights.  "They said 'please come to Amsterdam to identify the painting'. I said 'OK, but I'll believe it when I see it'." "You constantly keep on thinking about it but at the same time you don't want to hope too much because it could still fail," he said. When the painting was finally identified, he went straight to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam to give them an almighty surprise. "They didn't even know I was coming. I called and said 'I'm coming, are you there? Can you open the door and let me in. I have something for you'."   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Transport Malta corruption whistleblower to testify, court rules
Body: A court on Wednesday upheld a whistleblower's request to testify in proceedings about an alleged driving licence racket at Transport Malta.  The whistleblower, who also claims there is widespread voter fraud, was allegedly forced to leave the country after his residence permit was unexpectedly revoked. The man, whom independent candidate Arnold Cassola refers to through the pseudonym Aziz, worked as a translator with Transport Malta by assisting candidates who spoke neither Maltese nor English during their driving exam. Identity Malta has denied that ID cards of foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to foreign residents to vote for the PL.  In August, the whistleblower filed an application seeking to testify in the case which implicates other high-profile people including a "minister." On Wednesday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request as she presided over a court case against Clint Mansueto, Raul Antonio Pace and Philip Edrick Zammit who stand accused of corruption as former officials at the transport watchdog.  The prosecution said that it requested the witness to testify via video conferencing.  Although his application dealt with "other matters not related to this case" the prosecutors would likely put questions to test the credibility of the witness.  The court requested information as to the witness's whereabouts.  But AG lawyer Abigail Caruana Vella explained that the police inspector did not have information as to where the whistleblower lived abroad.  "However the police have spoken to him via video call," added the prosecuting lawyer. The witness will testify at a future sitting, with the date still to be determined. However, the prosecution is expected to inform court of the place from where he will testify before he actually testifies. The man, through his lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta, had filed a second application requesting to testify after his first application was not decreed upon by the court. The reason for that was that the magistrate could not take cognisance of his request since at the time of filing, the records were at the AG's office. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are assisting Mansueto. Lawyer Joe Giglio is assisting Pace. Lawyer Herman Mula is assisting Zammit.

Title: Doctors who certified benefit fraudsters: 'we were cheated too'
Body: Doctors on the medical board that greenlighted fraudulent disability benefit applications have defended their actions, claiming there was no way they could have detected the fraud. “We were as shocked as everyone else to learn of the racket because it was designed in a way that makes it impossible for the board members to know if an application was fraudulent,” one doctor said. “We feel like we have been cheated as well.” Six doctors and sources close to the government-appointed medical board spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity, saying they must be cautious given that police investigations and court cases are still ongoing.  RELATED STORIES  They said the fraudulent applicants seemed to have every single document in order and the medical certificates appeared to be signed and rubberstamped under the hospital’s official letterhead by their colleagues who they know, trust and had worked with for a long time. In reality, those signatures were forged, allowing millions of euros in taxpayer’s money to be diverted to people claiming serious illness they did not have. “The doctors who appeared to have signed the documents are our colleagues, mentors and friends. Some of them taught us at the university, they work diligently and are professionals of great principle and integrity and we trust them blindly,” one source said. “We knew they would never certify someone as having a condition they did not really have. So, when we saw their signatures and rubberstamps on medical certificates, we never doubted it for a second.” Asked why they did not conduct sporadic checks on the authenticity of the certificates, the sources said the board was never instructed to work in that manner. “In hindsight, now that everybody knows there was a racket, it’s easy to say we should have checked whether there were forged documents. But, back then, we had absolutely no reason to doubt the documents’ authenticity,” another source said. “In our decades-long careers we have never seen anything like this... we’ve never seen anything of this magnitude,” another said. They said they only realised there was a racket when the police called them to inform them of the discovery of forged documents and when their colleagues – who had their signatures forged – told them about it.   The government-appointed medical board came under the spotlight after Times of Malta revealed earlier this month that former Labour MP Silvio Grixti was implicated in a racket that saw scores of people – possibly hundreds – access disability benefits they were not entitled to. He has, so far, not been charged with his suspected key role in the racket. Police investigations indicated Grixti, who at the time was a backbench MP, would allegedly give people an envelope containing forged medical documents certified by several Maltese consultants, all saying that they examined the benefit claimant and found them to be suffering from a severe disability. The revelations have since raised questions over why the board, which is tasked with validating the applications, did not notice the fraudulent applications. But doctors and sources close to the medical board told Times of Malta it is not fair for people to turn the guns on them because the way the board works makes it impossible to detect a dishonest application. “Imagine this: an applicant comes before you saying they suffer from epilepsy. There is no way you can assess the symptoms of a condition like that during an interview and you are asked to decide on the application there and then, so you must rely on medical certificates. "The applicant hands you medical certificates signed by doctors you trust blindly, confirming they really have the condition and, according to the benefit criteria, they are truly eligible for the benefit. What do you do? You have no option but to green-light that application,” one source explained. “That is why many board interviews lasted all of five minutes. It’s not that we were carelessly shunning our responsibilities but when you open the envelope and see a trusted doctor’s signature confirming a disability which qualifies for the benefit, that’s all you need to know – it’s case closed in a few minutes. You must approve it.” All the sources denied they were complicit in the racket or suspected their colleagues and said they never received calls from people in higher authority to let dishonest applications slide. The board is comprised of around 20 physicians and every application is assessed by a rotating panel of three people – two doctors and a board secretary. Speaking to Times of Malta on Monday, a neurologist who had his signature forged on the documents of at least 30 fraudulent applications, said the documents were “literal photocopies” and were almost all identical. Senior neurologist Anthony Galea Debono said the writing was illegible, had a rubberstamp he had not used in around six years, the text was riddled with grammatical errors and did not make medical sense. He said this led him to question how the doctors on the medical board had not smelt a rat when they came across a series of “such nonsense”. “How is it possible that none of them noticed they were presented with 30 identical photocopies of certificates,” he asked. “It was sheer incompetence. One wonders whether they were really medically qualified.”   But the medical board sources insisted that, since the doctors rotated, it was very unlikely for the same doctor to come across two photocopied certificates and, even if they did, they would have seen the second one weeks – or even months – after the first one, making it virtually impossible for any doctor to remember or compare the similarities. Times of Malta has seen several forged medical documents, some of which were written in virtually illegible handwriting. Some consultants said they could not even read the handwriting that was on documents that had their signature. “Since the racket was uncovered, we changed practices and are dealing with applications differently,” one medical board source said. Grixti was himself appointed to the government medical board in 2013 and served as one of the doctors who validated social benefits applications around the beginning of the Labour administration. According to sources, however, the forging of documents appears to have started after he had stopped serving on the board. Times of Malta also sent questions to the director general of the social security department – Grazio Barbara – on why so many fraudulent applications went unnoticed by the board. He said the independent board that was appointed last week to evaluate the process of how benefits are awarded will also look into “the medical verification of applications”. Barbara said the board has also been tasked with making recommendations and their report will serve as a basis for any further actions. Asked whether the Social Security Department has taken any action against any of the medical board members, he said that the authorities will follow the instructions of the police and cooperate fully “should the police instruct any action following its investigations”. “However, it must also be stated that,  in the first months of 2022, stricter due diligence was imposed on the medical review procedures,” he said. “This intensified after a number of suspect cases were detected by the income support and compliance division in September 2022.” Editorial note: The Medical Board is made up of 19 doctors whose names are publicly available. However, not all members of the board took part in assessments for severe disability benefits concerning epilepsy.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Explosives-laden drone 'neutralised' on roof of Ecuador prison
Body: Ecuadoran police defused an explosives-laden drone Tuesday on the roof of a prison in a complex that has been the scene of gruesome inmate massacres committed by rival gangs. Interior Minister Juan Zapata posted photos on X, formerly Twitter, of the drone he described as an "explosive device" perched on the roof of La Roca maximum security jail in Guayaquil. The prison holds some of Ecuador's most dangerous criminals, including six Colombians suspected in the killing of presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio last month. Zapata said the drone was "intended to be brought into" the prison. The minister posted a video hours later of the device being blown up, all but destroying the roof of the detention facility. He said a specialized team "neutralised the drone," and all prisoners in the affected area had been transferred somewhere else for their safety. Ecuador, until a few years ago a peaceful haven nestled between the world's largest cocaine producers - Colombia and Peru, has recently descended into violence as it has itself become a hub for drug trafficking. Rival gangs with links to Colombian and Mexican cartels regularly clash in prisons, with more than 430 inmates killed since 2021, often leaving a trail of burned and dismembered bodies. The homicide rate in the country of 18.3 million rose to a record 26 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2022, almost double the previous year and higher than the rates in Colombia, Mexico or Brazil. The city most affected by the violence has been the sprawling port of Guayaquil in the southwest, used by the fast-expanding drug trade to smuggle narcotics to Europe and the United States. In 2021, the SNAI prison authority reported an attack with drones on the Guayaquil prison complex that includes La Roca. There were no casualties, but major damage to the prison roofs. The country's prisons have become dens of crime due to "the increasingly acute state absence... that has caused part of the prison population to become effectively hostages of criminal gangs that have much influence, also in politics," Billy Navarrete of the CDH rights watchdog told AFP. The violence has spread to all spheres of life, and on August 9, Villavicencio was gunned down in Quito ahead of a first round of voting in Ecuador's general elections. A second round is scheduled for October 15. A mayor, a national lawmaker and a local political leader have also been killed during the election campaign.

Title: Editorial: There are too many holes in our border control
Body: When, a year ago, it emerged that a former gaming consultant was able to leave the island a number of times notwithstanding a European arrest warrant hanging over his head Times of Malta had raised the issue of border control. “The public,” it had observed, “does not know to what extent Malta’s ports are exposed because of what appears to be an inadequate reporting system within the police force about wanted people, whether Maltese or foreign nationals.” The removal of the old embarkation card system as Malta had moved closer to EU membership and, subsequently, the introduction of the passport-free Schengen Area provoked a discussion on effective monitoring over who is entering and leaving the country. The idea to have as little barriers as possible was, of course, positive, aimed at facilitating travel and trade across Europe. However, the lack of checks at borders did raise the spectre of bad apples, such as criminals and terrorists, being able to move with ease from one country to another to escape detection and also capture. This state of affairs necessitated close and persistent coordination between all relevant authorities – including intelligence sharing – as well as robust security measures in place to still be able to manage and secure borders. The ‘disappearance’ from Malta of a man defined by a magistrate as “a lethal weapon” ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated” makes law-abiding citizens wonder whether something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   Such fears are justified when considering that Jomic Calleja Maatouk had failed to sign the bail book for days before it was realised he had gone missing. The police only started looking for him when his partner’s brother and then her grandmother raised the alarm. The court’s description of him indicates the man should be considered “armed and dangerous”. At law, he is still presumed innocent even though he was convicted by the magistrates’ court of importing explosives and trying to buy lethal poisons over the dark web. This is because he has appealed from the five-year jail sentence handed down in July. Added to that the man’s long criminal record and a history of absconding, it boggles the mind how the police and the security service do not appear to have kept a very close eye on him. Similarly, it is unclear why – after he submitted his appeal – the attorney general did not ask for stricter bail conditions. Calleja Maatouk, thought to have fled the country by sea, now features on Europe’s list of most wanted fugitives. When, last year, gaming consultant Iosip Galea was arrested in Italy as he was wanted in Germany, it transpired he was able to travel out of Malta with some ease even if he was the subject of two European arrest warrants. An internal inquiry subsequently found that the German request for the man’s arrest was ignored on three occasions by the head of the police bureau handling such matters. Two officers were declared to have failed in their duties, one of them deeming the inquiry a mere “public relations exercise”. And, so it seems, judging by the latest case, even if the circumstances are not identical. This scenario can only bring to the fore the matter of electronic tagging and whether the law providing for a stay of a sentence handed down by a magistrate but not a judge needs urgent revision. There are evidently too many ‘holes’ in Malta’s border control regime. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Ex-president calls for review of benefits system after racket exposed
Body: Former president and social security minister Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca has called for a full review of how benefits are assessed after Times of Malta exposed a huge racket that allowed hundreds of people to cheat the system. The ex-head of State and long-time Labour MP said the detail of the revelations destroyed trust, hurt those who most need help and were “a blow to the system of solidarity”. She spoke out after revelations that ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti helped hundreds of people get monthly severe disability benefits they were not entitled to through forged documents. “It is also crucial that, if we want to rebuild trust in the system, then justice must be served and appropriate action is taken,” Coleiro Preca told Times of Malta. She said it is encouraging that the ministry’s income support and compliance division (ISCD) detected suspicious transactions “but we need to go further”. “We have to review the entire process of how assessments for social benefits are made and ensure that proper checks and balances are in place to deter any potential abuse,” she said.   “Correct information about eligibility criteria to access benefits should be widely disseminated and policies should be transparent and accountable. We need to ensure information about all aspects of the process, from policy development to the implementation level, are accessible to ensure an equitable, fair and just outcome. Coleiro Preca was family and social solidarity minister between 2013 and 2014 and, during her tenure, appointed Grixti to a medical board that was tasked with validating applications for social benefits. However, according to sources, the forging of documents appears to have started after he had stopped serving on the board. The years-long racket saw people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, receive around €450 monthly, collectively defrauding millions in taxpayer money. Following the revelations, the social policy ministry confirmed some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to. But that figure is expected to climb even higher as the police continue to comb through all 761 applications awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022.   Coleiro Preca, who served as head of State from 2014 to 2019 and now leads The Malta Trust Foundation, which helps support vulnerable people, said she was concerned about the impact on those who need the benefit. “I am particularly worried about how vulnerable individuals, who are genuinely seeking social benefits to mitigate hardships emanating from sickness and other social conditions will be impacted due to this investigation,” she said. “Unfortunately, those who are honest and genuinely in need of social benefits now risk being perceived as abusers and fraudulent, which will have a traumatising effect on them.” Coleiro Preca urged the media to protect vulnerable individuals and their families as they delve deeper into the story and to ensure that, through reporting, they are “not discriminated against or made to feel like criminals”. Dozens of claimants who benefitted from the racket have already been charged and more people are expected to be arraigned in the coming weeks and investigators are not excluding the possibility that the racket could have begun even before 2019.

Title: 'You'll end up like Bernice': man jailed for threatening to kill ex partner
Body: A drug addict who constantly bombarded his ex-partner with demands for money, threatening that she would “end up like Bernice” and that their three children would “be motherless” has been jailed for three and a half years.  The 41-year-old Tarxien resident whose name is being withheld to protect the identity of his victim and their children - two of whom are minors - was arrested after the woman reported him to the police in March. That was her second report against the man whom court was told on Wednesday has been gripped by a serious drug problem for 15 years.  The woman's first report was filed in October 2022, and the man had allegedly smashed her car windscreen after he learnt she had reported him to the police.    The long-suffering woman poured out her troubles to the police, describing her ex’s constant demands for money to fuel his drug addiction.  She tried to keep him calm, hoping to stop the situation from escalating further. That was why she answered his persistent calls and handed him money - between €60 to €120 daily - later testifying that she “always tried to protect the children”. “What could I do?” the woman remarked.  The couple had been estranged for five years but the harassment escalated after the man got to know that his ex had dined with a male friend.  He grew obsessed with the thought that she had a relationship with that man so his calls increased in frequency and intensity.  On March 16, she received three calls from her ex between 9.22pm and 9.47pm. Those calls were made from his friend’s mobile.  Two days later,  her ex rang her doorbell early in the morning. She immediately called the police but he had left by the time they arrived.  At 6am, she headed to the domestic violence unit to file her second report which resulted in her ex’s arrest.  He was subsequently charged with causing her fear of violence, subjecting her to moral and psychological violence, harassment as well as insults and threats.  The woman’s version was supported by three recordings of telephone conversations with the accused who knew that she was sometimes recording him.  Their eldest daughter, who refused to speak to her father, also corroborated her mother’s version.  'Domestic violence victims often prefer to suffer in silence' The defence questioned why the alleged victim kept answering the accused’s calls and handing him money, thus further fueling his addiction rather than seeking police help immediately.  However, the court, presided over by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, shot down that argument observing that “it was easy to argue in that manner in a purely clinical context” where emotions did not play a part.  It was different for a domestic violence victim who knew that her report would likely result in criminal action and jail for the father of her children.  “It’s a fact that domestic violence victims often prefer to suffer in silence, sometimes for years, rather than report to the police for various reasons including fear of retaliation by the aggressor and [the fear] that matters would take a turn for the worse.”  The accused had smashed his ex’s car windscreen after she reported him the first time. He would tell her that he “pitied the kids because they would end up motherless because of her”. He threatened to shoot her and that “she would end up like Bernice”.  Bernice Cassar was allegedly shot dead by her estranged husband in Corradino in November of last year. On Wednesday the court concluded that the prosecution had proved its case and condemned the man to a three and a half years jail term, less the time spent in preventive custody.  The accused had a criminal record marred by 14 convictions and he had wasted previous opportunities, refusing to enter rehabilitation to quit his drug problem, insisting that he could do it alone.  But he evidently needed help and that was available within the confines of prison, said the Magistrate, also issuing a three-year restraining order that would take effect once he had served his sentence.  Inspectors Omar Zammit and Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Cleaner to face sentencing again after judgment quashed over technicality
Body: A cleaner handed a three-year jail term after admitting to stealing from two private residences, will face sentencing afresh after the first judgment was annulled over a 'formal defect' in the date.  Seliam Ann Elbueshi Perry, 43, was found guilty upon admission to the two aggravated thefts which took place between September 2017 and March 2018 from two private apartments in Sliema and Msida.  She was handed a three-year effective jail term by a Magistrates’ Court.  Her new lawyers, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, filed an appeal, requesting the court to deliver a fairer and more equitable punishment.  The appeal was assigned to Mr Justice Neville Camilleri in January 2023.  When delivering judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that the date on the first judgment was “May 2019”. But that date was crossed out between parallel lines and another date, “ November 2, 2021” was handwritten next to it. There was nothing to indicate that that correction had been duly authorised. The corresponding court minute dated November 2, 2019, stated that the case had been decided and judgment delivered that day.  Although not every error or inaccuracy in a judgment results in nullity, the date on a judgment was not “an unnecessary formalism but an essential element since it provided certainty as to the time of sentencing”, observed the judge.  Such an obvious requisite, although not listed as one of the formal requisites under Article 382 of the Criminal Code, was essential because it ensured the proper administration of justice.  The date defined the time limit for appealing the judgment and also served as the starting point for the legal consequences of a conviction to enter into effect.  That was why a clear indication of the date was indispensable and the absence thereof was deemed as a breach of a rule of public order, that could be flagged by the court ex officio.  Citing jurisprudence on the matter, the court concluded that the judgment was to be revoked, pointing out, however, that it was not the entire proceedings that were being annulled.  The records of the case were to be sent back to the Magistrates’ Court for the appellant to be placed in the position she was in immediately prior to sentencing.

Title: Femicide suspect Roderick Cassar denied bail again
Body: A man who stands accused of murdering his estranged wife, Roderick Cassar, will continue to be held in preventive custody after a court once again denied his request for bail. Mr Justice Neville Camilleri rejected Cassar’s third request for bail after expressing doubts about whether he would abide by the bail conditions imposed on him. Cassar stands accused of stalking then shooting his wife Bernice in the head and chest in Triq il-Baċir, Paola on November 22 last year. It is the first case of murder with femicidal intent in Maltese criminal history. Prosecutors say that apart from murdering his wife and fleeing to his house in Qrendi, Cassar also used violence against her, stole her mobile phone and car keys, breached a protection order and harassed her. Cassar, they add, did not have a permit to use the shotgun he allegedly shot her with. The 42-year-old is pleading not guilty to all those charges. According to doctors, her cause of death was a gunshot to her face. Witnesses told police that the mother-of-two was dragged from her car by her estranged husband who then allegedly took a shotgun from his own vehicle and shot her twice in the chest and face. In a fresh application for bail, filed on Wednesday, his defence lawyers argued that the compilation of evidence against their client had now reached an advanced stage and only secondary witnesses still had to testify. They argued that their client satisfied the legal requirements to be granted bail and that although the public outcry caused by the alleged crime should be taken into consideration, it should not be the only element on which the court ought to decide on bail. The public outcry is something that will never change but this did not automatically mean that Cassar should never be released from preventive custody. They said the accused’s elderly father, John Cassar, was willing to step in as third-party guarantor. In their reply, prosecuting lawyers Angele Vella, Darlene Grima and Anthony Vella, from the Attorney General’s office, said that although he was presumed innocent until proven guilty, the crime with which he was accused was allegedly committed in breach of a protection order. This and the fact that he spent 17 hours disobeying police orders until he was eventually arrested on the day of the murder shows that he is not trustworthy and does not offer the necessary guarantees that he will respect the bail conditions. The lawyers said he also fled the scene of the crime so there was nothing stopping him from absconding. The prosecution reminded the court that the accused had threatened his wife's family and had posted on social media that “revenge is a must”. “All of you will pay for it, from Żebbuġ to Santa Luċija,” Cassar had allegedly menaced. It said there was a real fear that the accused would commit another crime and that this alone led to public alarm and disquiet. At a bail hearing on Thursday, the court also heard lawyers representing Bernice Cassar’s relatives about their fear of Cassar being granted bail. After hearing submissions and considering the presumption of innocence on one hand and the public interest and public outcry caused by the crime on the other hand, the court turned down the request since it was not convinced that the accused would abide by bail conditions. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Jacob Magri are defence counsel. Lawyers Marita Pace Dimech and Ann Marie Cutajar appeared parte civile.

Title: Żurrieq jeweller found in 'pool of blood' after pre-planned attack, court hears
Body: A woman involved in the trio who allegedly attacked and left for dead the owner of a Żurrieq jewelry shop had hinted to a fellow inmate at Corradino about the intended robbery a few weeks beforehand, a court heard. Joe Carabott, 67, was beaten unconscious after he called out for help during the robbery, the inspector leading the investigation told the court on Thursday. Details of the plot, which left the victim fighting for his life, emerged at the first hearing of the compilation of evidence against Donna Borg Sciberras, Mohamed Anas Boualam and Zouhair Hadoumi who deny attempted murder and violent aggravated theft. During lengthy testimony, prosecuting inspector Lydon Zammit told the court how investigators pieced together evidence, ultimately tracking down the suspects to an abandoned house metres away from the Sliema police station. He described how the victim was found face down, his head in a pool of blood and unconscious. The court heard how the family of the 67-year-old owner of the jewellery shop on Dun Ġuzepp Zammit became concerned after he failed to call for his wife as planned at around 7.15pm on August 25. His son headed to the shop to check, finding the shutter of the shop down and the front door closed.  He somehow managed to open the shutter, just enough to catch sight of his father, lying on the floor in the back of the shop, slightly moving his bound feet and making some sound.  Police and paramedics were alerted and smashed a side shop window to gain access to the victim who had head injuries. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and in danger of dying.    Two large safes inside the back room were open and so was another smaller safe. Gold items were missing from the showcases and the cash register drawer was also emptied.  The inspector said that CCTV footage showed the suspects were not masked and although one of them wore a cap, their faces were visible. Borg Sciberras, whose face was familiar in police circles, was the first to be identified, followed by Anas.  Investigators discovered the trio had reached Żurrieq that evening after booking a cab through a number, whose owner was 'Anas'. They were dropped off near the parish church, walked towards their destination and crossed the street opposite the shop.    Some twenty minutes later, they stepped out again and pulled down the shutter, then headed on foot to Blue Grotto Avenue where they left in another taxi.  That second taxi was not booked, with the driver calling out to Anas, saying his name, and all three got in. They returned to a Żebbuġ residence from where they first headed out earlier that afternoon.  When it was searched, a resident told police that Anas lived there in a downstairs room which he had lately been sharing with a woman called Donna.    Inside that residence, police found a bag of 620 ecstasy pills and a jacket that matched one seen in footage from the crime scene, as well as a small white price tag like others seen at the shop. They also found a tiny studded earring and a small pearl just beneath the front doorstep.  As more information came in, police eventually tracked the trio to an abandoned residence on Manuel Dimech Street Sliema, just metres away from the police station.  They later discovered that the place had formerly been the home of Hadoumi’s mother.  When the officers forced their way in at around 7.15pm on Sunday, they found Borg Sciberras on the roof of the neighbouring building and Hadoumi was caught in the garden of another abandoned building some five roofs away. Anas was holed up in a small space.  As police searched the house where the suspects appeared to have been living, they came across a black handbag containing €1,785 in cash and a manbag with €440 in cash.  Inside that manbag was a gold cross, another white price tag like the ones in the shop and the Zebbuġ residence along with Hadoumi’s personal documents.  Inside a black haversack on a bed, police found two wrist watches.  One of those was later identified by a customer who had dropped off two watches for repairs at the victim’s shop, shortly before the robbery.  The victim had placed the watches in a black pouch he usually carried around with him, containing his wallet, ID card and other personal items.  That pouch was subsequently retrieved by a third party who spotted it in the sea as he headed his boat into the Msida marina and took it to the police station.  A small red hammer was found in the black pouch. Inside the Sliema house police found a bag containing gold items and small boxes stamped with the jeweller’s logo and Zurrieq address.  More of the same kind of boxes were later discovered in another abandoned building opposite the marina in Pieta, but no gold was found there.  Anas denied that he was the one who beat the victim, saying that he was on site.  Hadoumi supplied more information, explaining how he met the other two at a Sliema cafeteria a couple of days before the robbery.  He was told about the plot and on that Friday, they called him to join them at the Żebbuġ residence from where Anas booked the cab that drove them to Żurrieq.  He blamed Anas for the beating and described the dynamics of the robbery.  When he and Borg Sciberras entered the shop, they hit the victim with the handle of a knife hidden in her bosom. She later denied that, Inspector Zammit said. His role was to help tie up the victim, smash the showcases and seize the valuables, Hadoumi claimed.  He also described how his “burlier” accomplice had allegedly been called for assistance and had grabbed the victim by the neck, floored him and beat him up.  Borg Sciberras told police that they had got the shop’s location through Google Maps and also that a former fellow inmate had told her that there were no security cameras in the shop.  She said that Hadoumi was the one who gave the victim the worst beating. She told police that after they first tied up the victim, he began to shout. That was when he was attacked again. Then for the next 15 minutes or so he made no other reaction. They smashed the showcases with a hammer.  Borg Sciberras said her role was to snatch the gold from the shop window and counter. Mere hours after the robbery, the trio sold some of the booty as they moved from Zebbug, to Pieta and finally to Sliema. In the following hours, Borg Sciberras tattooed the name of one of her accomplices with whom she had a relationship. That name was ‘Anas.’ The inspector told the court that a Corradino inmate who heard about the robbery spoke to a police officer and claimed that Borg Sciberras had hinted to her about the robbery weeks before. Two eyewitnesses also gave evidence before magistrate Ian Farrugia about spotting suspicious people outside the shop at about 6pm on the day of the incident. One resident saw a woman, a thin man and a large man wearing a top with '35' printed on it entering the shop. The resident was able to identify this man in court as Anas. A woman saw two 'suspicious-looking' men leave the shop, speaking a language she did not understand but that was neither Maltese nor English.  At the end of the sitting the court declared that there was sufficient primae facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment.  The case continues in October. Attorney General lawyers Anthony Vella and Kaylie Bonnet prosecuted together with Inspectors Lydon Zammit, Stephen Gulia, Jonathan Cassar and Sean Pawney. Legal aid lawyers Brandon Muscat, Mark Mifsud Cutajar and Maria Karlsson are assisting the accused. Lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Ana Thomas appeared on behalf of the victim.

Title: Benefit fraud: Key officials in EU institutions alerted to criminal racket
Body: MEP David Casa has alerted key officials in EU institutions to the organised criminal racket implicating Labour supporters and government officials. On Sunday, Times of Malta revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with Grixti implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to. The figure is expected to grow. Casa said the "sophisticated" benefit fraud scheme implicated members of the governing Labour Party. “The facts of this case are simply revolting and Robert Abela has shown where his priorities lie in the fight against corruption,” Casa charged.  Addressing the key rule of law figures in the EU, Casa stressed that the criminal enterprise is not to be seen in isolation, but “joins a list of incessant, unresolved cases of wrongdoing, which the Maltese public has to endure on a daily basis.” The only way this could have been accomplished, explained Casa, was through “government services being completely hijacked and systemically compromised so as to allow the fraud to proceed without question.” Casa slammed the “concerted criminal effort to defraud the taxpayer and manipulate elections”, which has cost the taxpayer millions of euro. He emphasised that while hundreds of criminals were being quietly exposed, the big fish continued to elude prosecution two years after the racket was first detected. Casa presented the case to the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, vice-president Věra Jourová, and to the chair of the Democracy, Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights Monitoring Group within the European Parliament. He called for the facts to be taken seriously failing, any good faith action on the part of the Maltese government. “The only traitors are those who betrayed their oath of public service, not only to tarnish their country's reputation, but to undermine the very processes on which our democracy is based. I will not be threatened by scoundrels and thieves in fulfilling my obligations to my electorate,” Casa stated. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: PN calls on Abela to 'take on political responsibility' for benefits racket
Body: Prime Minister Robert Abela must shoulder political responsibility for the social benefits racket which has so far defrauded taxpayers of €2.1 million, the Nationalist Party said on Wednesday.  PN MP Paula Mifsud Bonnici said one aim of the fraud was for the Labour Party could steal votes and steal thousands of euros from people’s pockets.  “We are calling on Prime Minister Robert Abela to take on political responsibility,” she said.  “What more does Abela know about this fraud? It seems that unfortunately, after many hours since the details of the racket have come out, we have a prime minister, who has nothing to say. A prime minister who is scared to take on responsibility.”   Times of Malta on Sunday revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million, while hundreds more are still under investigation.  Evidence seen by Times of Malta indicates that many of the claimants hailed from Labour strongholds like Żabbar, Żejtun and Paola. On Tuesday evening, Abela said that no sitting MP is involved in the racket and that Castille had immediately taken action when it received reports of the allegations. Mifsud Bonnici said the Labour government is built on ways to buy votes and steal money from the public, rather than working on ensuring there is enough help for the public, especially those who need it. She also criticised Social Policy Minister, Michael Falzon, for his silence on the racket.  “Why do we have a minister, a veteran minister who has had this portfolio for many years, who is also silent,” she asked. “The ministry gave us details about how many people have been ordered to return the money, yet it failed to give us details about who, in the first place, gave this money to people who did not need it.” She said it was clear that there were people involved in this benefit fraud scheme who deal with people every day, people involved in customer care of the minister and Castille customer care.  “I ask Michael Falzon, are you checking who these people are? Are they in your department? In your ministry? In Castille?" Fellow PN MP Claudette Buttigieg asked why there is no magisterial inquiry on this fraudulent benefit scheme that has disgusted and angered the public.  “No one has any doubt that this was set up by a criminal organisation, it was structured to ensure that you offer people something, these benefits, and you steal your vote,” she said. She said she knew of many specialists who had their names on these fake documents, and they are "extremely disgusted".  She also called for public service workers involved in this racket to "come clean". “How can it be no one realised the large numbers of people gaining from these benefits?” When asked by journalists if any PN MP is part of the abuse, Mifsud Bonnici appealed to the police to carry out their investigations and bring anyone forward who is responsible for this fraud deal.

Title: Far-right Proud Boys leader gets 22 years for US Congress attack
Body: Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys militia, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, the stiffest sentence handed out so far. "That day broke our previously unbroken tradition of peacefully transferring power," US District Judge Timothy Kelly said of the attempt to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Donald Trump. "Mr Tarrio was the ultimate leader of the conspiracy," Kelly said during a nearly four-hour sentencing hearing in the nation's capital. Prosecutors had sought a 33-year prison term for Tarrio, who was not in Washington on January 6 but was accused of directing the military-style assault on the Capitol by members of the Proud Boys and other supporters of the former president. The 39-year-old Tarrio and several other members of the Proud Boys were convicted of seditious conspiracy in May for their roles in the attack. Another member of the Proud Boys, Ethan Nordean, 32, received an 18-year prison sentence from Kelly last week. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of another far-right militia central to the Capitol siege, the Oath Keepers, was also sentenced to 18 years in prison earlier this year. Tarrio addressed the court before the sentence was handed down and said January 6 was a "national embarrassment." "My candidate lost," he said. "I persisted when I should have calmed." Tarrio, who appeared to choke up on several occasions, apologized to members of law enforcement who were attacked by rioters on what he called a "horrible day." "I failed miserably," he said. "This trial has humbled me." Prosecutor Conor Mulroe, arguing for the 33-year prison term, said Tarrio and the other members of the Proud Boys "tried to use force and violence to try and impose their view of what was right for the country." "It was Mr Tarrio with the assistance of his codefendants who put this group together," Mulroe said.  In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors described Tarrio as a "savvy propagandist" and said that while he was not physically present in Washington on January 6 he "did far more harm than he could have as an individual rioter." Tarrio had acted as a "general rather than a soldier," they said. "The only reason Tarrio did not march alongside the others is because he was arrested upon his arrival in Washington DC and placed under a court order to leave the District," they added. The assault on Congress left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured and followed a fiery speech by Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the election. Trump is to go on trial in Washington in March on charges of conspiring to overturn the November 2020 election results. He faces similar charges in a separate case in the southern state of Georgia. The 77-year-old Trump was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after the Capitol riot - he was charged with inciting an insurrection - but was acquitted by the Senate. More than 1,100 people have been charged by the Justice Department in the Capitol attack. Some 630 of them have pleaded guilty to various charges, and 110 have been found guilty at trial.

Title: Watch: 'No sitting MP involved in benefit fraud racket' - Robert Abela
Body: No sitting Member of Parliament is involved in a racket linked to an ex-Labour MP that saw hundreds of people fraudulently receive disability benefits they were not entitled to, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Tuesday. "I am convinced that no MP in any way participated, or directed someone to commit irregularities," Abela said on Tuesday.   Abela's comments come after Times of Malta on Sunday revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with Silvio Grixti implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. The racket, which continued to grow over the years, saw hundreds of people claim benefits for conditions they did not suffer from, with the ‘severe disability’ of choice understood to have been frequent epileptic fits. While the number of false claims is yet to be determined, two sources close to the ongoing police investigations said the figure could reach around 800, with evidence seen by Times of Malta indicating that often the claimants hailed from Labour strongholds like Żabbar, Żejtun and Paola. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million while hundreds of others are still being investigated. On Tuesday Abela said the allegations about Grixti were "still allegations investigated by the police". He said Castille immediately took action when it received reports of the allegations. The case was reported to the police and Grixti was asked to resign from his role as MP, Abela said. "The case was revealed by Castille and reported to the police by Castille," he said. "The report on Sunday was no new discovery. So much so that I took the political decision a long time ago on this case that led to the resignation of a PL MP," he said. On whether people within Castille's customer care staff or OPM officials directed people to the fraudulent scheme Abela said he would not comment on individuals. "I will not comment on the involvement, or lack of involvement, of individuals because there are ongoing investigations," he said. Abela added that a system within the Social Policy Ministry designed to flag fraudulent claims caught several suspicious cases. "Those cases were also referred to the police". Reacting to the revelations earlier on Tuesday, the president of Malta’s medical association Martin Balzan on Tuesday branded the racket “organised crime”. Meanwhile, rule-of-law NGO Repubblika said on Tuesday that political responsibility must be shouldered for the fraud, saying the Prime Minister cannot hide behind a judicial process to avoid being accountable. Independent candidate Arnold Cassola later urged MPs elected from the second, third and fourth districts to declare they had nothing to do with the 'racket'. And after the PN expressed concern that Abela had not yet said a word or taken any action about the racket, the government said the OPM had commented on the matter from before the article was published, replying to the journalist's questions.

Title: €2.1m in fraudulent benefits ordered to be refunded so far
Body: Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to as police continue to investigate a huge racket linked to an ex-Labour MP. That figure, supplied by the Ministry for Social Policy, is expected to climb even higher as officers continue to comb through all 761 applications that were awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022. The police are assessing how many of these were fraudulent claims as evidence indicates family doctor Silvio Grixti provided false medical certificates for people to receive benefits of around €450 a month that they were not entitled to.   RELATED STORIES  Dozens of claimants who benefitted from the racket have already been charged and more people are expected to be arraigned in the coming weeks. The majority have admitted to fraud charges and agreed to return their ill-gotten gains, and have received suspended sentences. Responding to questions from Times of Malta, the Ministry for Social Policy said that authorities have so far stopped issuing the benefit to 141 cases in which people were found to have fraudulently taken money they were not entitled to. Between them they defrauded taxpayers of €2.1 million and authorities have launched actions to get the money back. The ministry said €330,000 has already been recouped. The ministry said in all 141 cases, the benefit was awarded before September last year. Claimants have been reaching agreements with the Social Security Department to return the amounts illicitly received from the scam. Those who have been receiving the money for a few years have been ordered to return between €11,000 and €25,000 each. The ministry said that in September last year, its Income Support and Compliance Division (ISCD) detected suspicious severe disability assistance applications and alerted the police to possible forged medical certificates. “The ISCD has operational procedures aimed at preventing and detecting benefit fraud and these procedures are effective and are reviewed regularly,” a ministry spokesperson said. “This process led the ISCD to alert the police about possible forged medical certifications submitted with applications for Severe Disability Assistance (SDA).  “Following further investigations by the police, the ISCD was instructed to refer details of all the cases that were awarded an SDA between 2019 and 2022. However, this does not mean that all these cases are fraudulent.” Police had first questioned Grixti in connection with the case a year earlier when he had also resigned as MP, but the Ministry said it was never privy to those investigations and only became suspicious last year when it came across “a number of applications which had suspected forged medical documentation”, which it then forwarded to police for further investigations. The revelation has raised questions over why the government-appointed medical board, which is tasked with validating the applications, did not notice or disclose the fraudulent applications. The ministry said it accepts the decisions of the medical board which is lawfully appointed under the Social Security Act. “The decision of such medical panels, whether to approve or reject applications for such benefits, would represent the basis for the ISCD and the Social Security Department to accept or reject such applications,” the spokesperson said.  “Such decisions about medical eligibility are thus totally dependent on the decision of the respective medical panels.” Asked whether it has suspended any medical board members or reported them to the police, the Ministry said it had not received “any instructions or tangible feedback from the police to suggest taking such course of action”. Times of Malta has sent questions to the government-appointed medical board. The story on Sunday revealed how claimants told police investigators that they were referred to Grixti by a Labour minister, a now deceased PL MP, ministers’ aides, and even customer care officials from Castille. The Office of the Prime Minister denied ever referring people to any fraudulent scheme. But sources said the racket became so well known within Labour circles that it took a life of its own, with some claimants telling police they obtained the forged certificates from people other than Grixti. Meanwhile, in an open letter published on Tuesday, independent candidate Arnold Cassola urged government and opposition MPs from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th districts, to publicly declare that they or their aides never referred people to Grixti with the intent of helping them “exploit this illegal, disgusting scheme”. And in a reply to Times of Malta questions, the Commissioner for the Rights of Persons with Disability said that “it is important that where government funds are allocated, there should always be full transparency to ensure dissemination is fair and justifiable”.

Title: Prisoner tells court Matthew Schembri commissioned father-in-law attack
Body: Two men allegedly commissioned to attack a jogger on the Sliema seafront last year gave conflicting evidence when testifying in court against the alleged ‘mastermind’. Agostin Marku and Xhovano Ndoci were summoned as prosecution witnesses in proceedings against Matthew Joseph Schembri whom police describe as the “brains” behind the unprovoked aggression.  The 23-year-old Albanian nationals were - until a few weeks ago - jointly accused alongside Schembri. Their unsuspecting target was the 62-year-old father of Schembri’s ex-wife. He was assaulted by Marku and Ndoci one morning in June 2022 while out on his daily jog.  The hitmen later changed their plea to guilty and were both sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment and a €116 fine each. Marku was sentenced to 22 months while Ndoci got a 20-month jail term. Since neither of the men filed an appeal, that judgment was final and both became competent and compellable witnesses in the ongoing proceedings against Schembri.  On Tuesday, both men were escorted to court from Corradino Correctional Facility where they are currently serving jail time.  “I actually cannot remember everything exactly because it all happened over a year ago,” started off Marku, speaking in Albanian while two interpreters translated to English and then Maltese, given that the proceedings were being conducted in Maltese.  He recalled that the victim had “some problems with a person” he knew. “I just went after him and hit him,” said Marku, promptly earning a warning from presiding Magistrate Victor George Axiak who reminded the witness that he was to tell the truth or face the consequences.  The witness then recalled that “Matthew” was the person who had problems with the jogger. “But he [Matthew] did not tell me to do it. I did it out of my own will.”  Pressed further by prosecuting Inspector Lydon Zammit, the witness insisted that he could not remember what had happened and had even forgotten how he got to know the victim or who had pointed out the man.  As for his relationship with Schembri, Marku described him as his boss in the construction business.  And what about Schembri’s relationship with the victim, asked the prosecutor.  “I don’t remember. I’m not in a state to remember,” insisted Marku.  Although evasive when asked how he had got information about the target, he explained that he had followed the victim for some 10 days and had watched him jogging on three occasions.  “I knew he went jogging and knew that he had problems with Matthew but I’m not sure what the problems were about,” said Marku, insisting that he could not remember. “Had I been questioned before, perhaps I would have recalled.” As the witness stepped down, the prosecutor informed the court that Marku’s time in jail was to lapse in a matter of a few days since the time spent under preventive custody was to be deducted from his jail term.  Immigration authorities were already aware of that and would issue a removal order for Marku to be deported as soon as he steps out of jail.  Ndoci was next to testify, identifying Schembri and explaining how the accused had shown him a photo of the victim, along with his name and place of residence. That was how the hitman knew whom to target. After the hit, they were to receive money from Schembri. “But we were going to carry out the act out of respect for Matthew,” insisted Ndoci. Payment was promised prior to the hit but money was handed over after the attack, said the witness who said that he was to “beat or punch the person to get the money”. In light of the discrepancy in the witnesses’ testimonies and upon reasonable suspicion that Marku had not testified altogether truthfully, the court directed that Marku was not to be deported before he was escorted back to the witness stand and confronted with the discrepancies in his version.  That is scheduled to take place next week.  Inspector Lydon Zammit prosecuted. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Franco Debono and Jacob Magri are counsel to Schembri. Lawyer Charles Mercieca was counsel to Marku. Lawyers Veronique Dalli and Dean Hili were counsel to Ndoci.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: To steal today’s computerised cars, thieves go high-tech
Body: These days, cars are computer centres on wheels. Today’s vehicles can contain over 100 computers and millions of lines of software code. These computers are all networked together and can operate all aspects of your vehicle. It’s not surprising, then, that car theft has also become high-tech. The computers in a vehicle can be divided into four categories. Many computers are dedicated to operating the vehicle’s drive train, including controlling the fuel, battery or both, monitoring emissions and operating cruise control. The second category is dedicated to providing safety. These computers collect data from the vehicle and the outside environment and provide functions like lane correction, automatic braking and backup monitoring. The third category is infotainment systems that provide music and video and can interface with your personal devices through Bluetooth wireless communications. Many vehicles can also connect to cellular services and provide Wi-Fi connectivity. The final category is the navigation system, including the car’s GPS system. Computers in one category often need to communicate with computers in another category. For example, the safety system must be able to control the drive train and the infotainment systems. One difference between the network in your car and a typical computer network is that all devices in the car trust each other. Therefore, if an attacker can access one computer, they can easily access other computers in the car. As with any new technology, some aspects of today’s cars make it harder for thieves, and some make it easier. There are several methods of stealing a car that are enabled by today’s technology. One of the high-tech features is the use of keyless entry and remote start. Keyless entry has become common on many vehicles and is very convenient. The fob you have is paired to your car using a code that both your car and fob know, which prevents you from starting other cars. The difference between keyless entry and the remotes that unlock your car is that keyless entry fobs are always transmitting, so when you get near your car and touch the door, it will unlock. You had to press a button for old fobs to unlock the car door and then use your key to start the car. The first keyless fobs transmitted a digital code to the car, and it would unlock. Thieves quickly realized they could eavesdrop on the radio signal and make a recording. They could then “replay” the recording and unlock the car. To help with security, the newest fobs use a one-time code to open the door. One method of stealing cars involves using two devices to build an electronic bridge between your fob and your car. One person goes near the car and uses a device to trick the car into sending a digital code used to verify the owner’s fob. The thief’s device sends that signal to an accomplice standing near the owner’s home, which transmits a copy of the car’s signal. When the owner’s fob replies, the device near the house sends the fob signal to the device near the car, and the car opens. The thieves can then drive off, but once they turn the car off they cannot restart it. Carmakers are looking to fix this by ensuring the fob is in the car for it to be driven. The network used by all computers in a car to communicate is called a controller area network bus. It’s designed to allow the computers in a car to send commands and information to each other. The CAN bus was not designed for security, because all of the devices are assumed to be self-contained. But that presumption leaves the CAN bus vulnerable to hackers. Car thieves often try to hack into the CAN bus and from there the computers that control the car’s engine. The engine control unit stores a copy of the wireless key code, and thieves can clone this to a blank key fob to use to start the victim’s car. One method is accessing a car’s onboard diagnostics through a physical port or wireless connection meant for repair technicians. Thieves who access the onboard diagnostics gain access to the CAN bus. Another network hacking method is breaking through a headlight to reach the CAN bus via a direct wiring connection. Modern thieves also try the USB hack, which exploits a design flaw in Hyundai and Kia vehicles. This is more of an old-style hot-wiring of a car than a high-tech computer issue. It is named the USB hack because when thieves break into a car, they look for a slot in the steering column. It turns out that a USB connector fits into the slot, and this allows you to turn on the ignition. So all someone has to do is break the window, insert a USB connector and start the car. This technique has become infamous thanks to a loose affiliation of young car thieves in Milwaukee dubbed the Kia Boyz who have gained notoriety on TikTok. Hyundai and Kia have issued an update that closes the vulnerability by requiring the fob to be in the car before you can start it. Given there are so many different car models, and their complexity is increasing, there are likely to continue to be new and creative ways for thieves to steal cars. So what can you do? Some things are the same as always: Keep your vehicle locked, and don’t leave your key fob in it. What is new is keeping your vehicle’s software up to date, just as you do with your phone and computer. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Title: 'Who's going to carry political responsibility for disgusting benefits scandal?'
Body: Updated 9pm with David Casa statement  Political responsibility must be shouldered for the social benefits scandal, which implicated ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, rule-of-law NGO Repubblika said on Tuesday. The Prime Minister cannot hide behind the judicial process to avoid being accountable to the people, Repubblika president Robert Aquilina told a news conference outside Auberge de Castille.  The press conference was held following revelations by Times of Malta that a benefits racket had seen hundreds of people taking social benefits, intended for those with severe disabilities, to which they were not entitled. Grixti, forced to resign from parliament in 2021, has been implicated as having provided forged and falsified medical documents to back up the claims. Speaking on Tuesday, Aquilina said the scandal was “disgusting” and had stolen money that is supposed to go to people who are suffering from seriously challenging conditions. While the police have investigated and charged people who fraudulently took money from the government, he said this is not enough and that the police must go after the “big fish” - officials and people higher in office who facilitated the operation of the scheme. He also said Robert Abela cannot hide behind criminal proceedings to prevent political responsibility from being shouldered over the matter. Singling out social policy minister Michael Falzon, who is politically responsible for social benefits, Aquilina said that either Falzon knew about the scheme and benefited from it or that it was happening under his nose and he had no clue about it. “Either way, it means that he is not capable of occupying the role that he has,” Aquilina said. Both the authorities and the police have been “dead silent” on the scandal since it broke, he continued, which he said is unacceptable. “Neither the police, nor Robert Abela and the Labour Party have spoken about why Silvio Grixti had to resign,” Aquilina said. “Why did the police not hold a press conference about this and inform the people what they are doing about it. Why has a magisterial inquiry not been requested into the matter?” he asked. “Inquiries are opened for far less serious cases, because among other things they have the power to preserve evidence that could be found in mobile phones and laptops of ministers, public officials and their employees. The prime minister, Aquilina continued, has an obligation to answer important questions about the scandal, namely whether he, people close to him or members of his own secretariat, were personally involved in the matter, when he found out about it and if he reported it to the police. Additionally, Abela must tell the people who is going to be held politically responsible for it. “If not you, then whom?” Aquilina said. “We want answers and we want to see the big fish who facilitated the operation of this scheme to answer for their actions. People must be given an account of what was stolen from them and every cent taken must be paid back.”  In a statement, the PN said it was a matter of concern that the Prime Minister had not yet said a word or taken any action about the racket. The PN reiterated it was insisting on an investigation for the truth to come out. It said that the fact that the scandal allegedly involved the direct involvement of a sitting minister as well as the Office of the Prime Minister continued to shed a bad light on how the people’s money was being used for institutionalised fraud. “Who is Robert Abela protecting,” the PN asked. In a reply to the PN's statement, the government said that contrary to what the PN was claiming, the OPM had commented on the matter from before the article was published, replying to the journalist's questions. Minister Owen Bonnici had also given his categorical replies to questions he was asked. The OPM said that in its replies, it had been  very clear that a similar irregularity was reported to the police by the permanent secretary in charge of the People & Standards Division within the OPM. Further police investigations had followed and it did not result that any employee at the customer care division ever suggested any "claimant" or medical practitioner to commit any irregularity, nor that any such employee was aware of these alleged irregularities, the OPM said. It added that if the Opposition wanted to start being credible, it should at least stop basing its statements on untruths. Independent candidate Arnold Cassola urged MPs elected from the second, third and fourth districts to declare they had nothing to do with the 'racket'. Cassola addressed his appeal to Robert Abela, Alison Zerafa Civelli, Chris Agius, Glenn Bedingfield, Stephen Spiteri, Chris Fearne, Carmelo Abela, Andy Ellul, Ray Abela, Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, Jonathan Attard, Byron Camilleri, Chris Bonnet, Katya De Giovanni and Mark Anthony Sammut. "This racket, 'di stampo mafioso' cost, and is costing the country millions of euros, that were fraudulently stolen from patients and people who really need medical care and social support. "Żejtun, Żabbar and Paola were mentioned as hometowns of several people who benefited from this organised fraud," Cassola said. "Therefore, as MPs elected from these districts, I', asking you to publicly declare that neither you nor your canvassers, people of trust or customer care officials ever sent voters to Dr Silvio Grixti to take advantage of this illegal and disgusting scheme." PN MP David Casa said late on Tuesday he was flagging the matter with the European Parliament.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Benefit fraud racket: ‘This looks like organised crime’
Body: The president of Malta’s medical association has branded the benefit fraud racket linked to ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti as “organised crime”. “The scale of this suggests it came from above... to me, this sounds like organised crime,” said Martin Balzan, who discovered that his signature has been forged on around six or seven documents. “This is wrong. Cheating the system is wrong. That money is for people who are seriously disabled,” the Medical Association of Malta (MAM) president said on Monday. On Sunday, Times of Malta revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with Grixti implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. “Large numbers of my colleagues have been affected and it seems that seven or eight documents may have been forged at a time... certain things were blatant and it happened to a lot of specialists,” Balzan said. Balzan is the lead respiratory physician at Mater Dei Hospital, a senior lecturer at the University of Malta and earlier this year was elected vice president of the main EU doctors’ lobby, the Standing Committee of European Doctors. He said medical professionals were “very upset” their signatures had been forged, noting he was not treating any of the people whose falsified medical form his signature had appeared on. “None of them were my patients and this seems to be the case for my colleagues,” he said, adding he was “very annoyed” his signature had been falisified. “I’m very happy that the police investigated this. We need to go after the perpetrators and not just the beneficiaries,” Balzan said.  RELATED STORIES  The racket, which continued to grow over the years, saw hundreds of people claim benefits for conditions they didn’t suffer from, with the ‘severe disability’ of choice understood to have been frequent epileptic fits. While the number of false claims is yet to be determined, two sources close to the ongoing police investigations said the figure could reach around 800, with evidence seen by Times of Malta indicating that often the claimants hailed from Labour strongholds like Żabbar, Żejtun and Paola.   Grixti is alleged to have provided claimants with an envelope containing forged medical documents certifying them as suffering from one of the eligible conditions. The documents appeared to have been signed by several Maltese consultants who, when contacted by police, said they had never even seen the patients in question, let alone signed off the documents. The envelopes even included a false Transport Malta declaration saying the claimant had surrendered his or her driver’s licence, a requirement for people who suffer from frequent epileptic fits. The claimants would then appear before a government medical board whose job it was to assess the validity of each claim. The claimants told police they were asked to hand over the envelope to the board during an interview that in some cases lasted just “five minutes”. Some claimants told police they had been referred to Grixti from the Office of the Prime Minister’s customer care wing or from ministers’ aids. At least one claimant said he was referred to Grixti by Minister Owen Bonnici, while two others said they were roped into the scheme by the late Labour MP Silvio Parnis. Both the Office of the Prime Minister and Bonnici vehemently denied they ever referred anyone to participate in any fraudulent activity. In May, Social Justice Minister Michael Falzon said that over the last decade around 10,900 people had been caught receiving social benefits that they were not entitled to. “They are not only stealing money from the government, but they are also stealing from hard-working citizens who continuously contribute to our society.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Police launch manhunt for thief who robbed Pieta shop
Body: Police are currently searching for a man who held up a Pieta shop on Monday morning, the Malta Police Force said in a statement.  The incident occurred at around 10.15 am in Triq San Luqa, the street leading up to the main gate of St Luke’s Hospital, in Pieta.  Initial investigations have revealed that a hooded man walked into the shop and demanded money from the 21-year-old cashier, who is from Floriana.  The thief ran away after making off with cash and other items.  No one was injured in the incident.  Duty magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit was informed of the case and opened an inquiry. A police investigation into the matter is still ongoing.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Grandfather, 72, accused of sexually abusing his granddaughter
Body: A 72-year old pensioner was denied bail on Wednesday after pleading not guilty to sexually abusing his 15-year old granddaughter some five years ago.  The man, a former coach whose name and address were banned by the court because of his close ties to the alleged victim, was charged with defilement, non-consensual sexual acts and harassment.  The abuse had allegedly been ongoing for quite a while when the girl, who is now an adult, opened up to a counsellor.  She claimed that her grandpa would touch her intimately.  She apparently even exhibited suicidal tendencies.  Investigations kicked off when the matter was reported to the police.  A request for bail was strongly objected to, not only because of the very premature stage of the proceedings, but also because the alleged victim still has to testify.  The accused's lawyers argued that the fact that the main witness still had to testify did not automatically mean that bail should be denied.  The accused's son was outside the hall, wishing to testify so that his father might get bail.  Moreover, the accused was a former coach who had no brushes with the law and had never been jailed. The allegations dated back to 2019 and since then the alleged wrongdoing was never repeated, argued lawyer Jose' Herrera.  The rule was personal liberty, added lawyer Matthew Xuereb. In this case there was a pre-trial breach of the right to a fair hearing in view of the time it took to arraign the suspect, went on Xuereb, making reference to ECHR jurisprudence in this regard.  Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi denied bail in light of the serious nature of the charges, the fact that the alleged victim was a minor at the time of the alleged case, and she was a close relative of the accused and still to testify.  The court upheld a request for a protection order barring the accused from approaching or communicating with the alleged victim and her parents.  The "rather stringent" order was operative for six months, pointed out the court, explaining to the elderly man that he could not speak to his son for the coming months while the order remained in force.  "You must not speak to or approach anyone from your family about this case, " warned the magistrate. AG lawyers Angele Vella, Danika Vella and Inspector Roxanne Tabone prosecuted. Lawyers Jose' Herrera and Matthew Xuereb were defence lawyers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Jomic Calleja Maatouk placed on Europol’s most wanted list
Body: Convicted explosives importer Jomic Calleja Maatouk has been placed on Europol’s list of Europe’s most wanted fugitives after going missing from Malta. He is wanted for failing to appear in court and for failing to abide by bail conditions. Calleja Maatouk, 36, went missing last week while appealing a five-year prison sentence for importing explosives and trying to buy poison over the dark web. He must also serve a prison sentence over drug offences. He was out on bail after he appealed his conviction but did not sign a bail book for a number of days. According to the information on Europol’s most wanted list, Calleja Maatouk had forfeited €51,000 in bail bonds. He “has since not abided by the bail conditions he was to adhere to,” it said. “Jomic Calleja Maatouk is believed to have absconded the Maltese islands and according to latest intelligence, he is accompanied by a female companion, namely Marzia Marimar Calleja Maatouk,” it added. The authorities were last week in the process of issuing a European Arrest Warrant for Calleja Maatouk after he went missing with his wife and is believed to be in Serbia. Sources close to the police said investigators believe the couple probably fled Malta by sea. There had been no alerts for Calleja Maatouk at the airport or seaport. This led them to believe they either used false passports to get out of the country or crossed to Sicily by sea and then drove through Italy. In court, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech had described Calleja Maatouk as a “lethal weapon” who was ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk had been caught trying to import deadly material that included lethal doses of radioactive material Polonium-210, highly toxic poison Ricin, killer drug Fentanyl and C-4 explosives. His wife, 23-year-old Marzia, was last month sentenced to 15 months in jail for cannabis possession with intent to traffic. The crime took place in August 2019 when she was just 19 years old. She was caught with 340 grams of cannabis as well as other drug paraphernalia outside McDonald’s in Birkirkara in a car with Jomic Calleja, who was her boyfriend at the time. Maatouk’s family have told Times of Malta they are fearing for her safety after the couple’s home was found in disarray. They said Marzia has not been online on WhatsApp since Wednesday August 16 and calls to her mobile phone were returning voicemail messages that appeared to indicate it has been switched off for days. Her brother was the first to sound the alarm the following Thursday, when his sister did not show up at his shop to cover a shift and was not taking his calls. Her grandmother also began to suspect something was wrong when she tried calling her several times and could not reach her. The distressed woman filed a police report on Friday 18. “We are extremely worried she might have been forced to leave the country and that she might be in danger right now,” one tearful relative said. They said that when police and civil protection officers searched the couple’s house on Saturday, it looked as if someone had left “in a rush”. “And it is not typical of Marzia and her husband. They are usually very organised people.” Police and civil protection officials also found eight dogs and a bird inside the house ­– all pets of the couple. By Monday evening they had been relocated to other homes or animal shelters. Calleja Maatouk has a long criminal record as well as a history of fleeing the law. In 2015 he was arrested aboard a train in Sicily heading to the Italian mainland, having left Malta as he faced criminal proceedings related to cannabis trafficking.

Title: Three to be arraigned over violent Żurrieq jewellery shop hold-up
Body: Two men and a woman are due to be arraigned on Tuesday afternoon in connection with a violent robbery at a Żurrieq jewellery shop last Saturday, the police said. The jeweller, 67, was beaten and bound to a chair, and had to be rushed to hospital because of his serious injuries.  The three suspects, two men and a woman, were arrested after the police surrounded an abandoned building in Sliema on Saturday night. One News has named one of the suspects as Donna Borg Sciberras, 29, a person well known to the police. In 2015, she was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting to theft of jewellery and cash after she and two men assaulted an elderly man.   In 2019, also with two men she was also allegedly involved in the assault and robbery of a wheelchair-bound elderly man.    The police have reportedly recovered much of the jewellery and cash stolen on Friday.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: A bottle of Lachryma Vitis and a Red Bull - knife-wielding man's haul at hold-up
Body: A knife-wielding man who entered a Birkirkara shop on Saturday evening and made off with a bottle of wine and an energy drink was sentenced to imprisonment for one year suspended for three years on Monday. The incident took place at around 7:15pm when Kiro Trajkovski, a 37-year Macedonian entered a Convenience Shop. CCTV footage clearly showed him carrying a knife and committing the hold-up. He was arrested on Sunday and arraigned on Monday, pleading guilty to theft, exercising a pretended right in respect of the victim, carrying a knife without a police licence, uttering insults and threats as well as wilfully disturbing the public peace. When making submissions on punishment his lawyer highlighted his early guilty plea and the fact that all that the accused stole were a “bottle of Lachryma Vitis and one Red Bull.” The man, a former cleaner but currently unemployed, had fully cooperated after being arrested and expressed remorse for what he had done. “It was a simple theft, aggravated by the use of a knife,” argued the lawyer. Magistrate Leonard Caruana, condemned the accused to a one-year jail term suspended for three years. “Thank you, your Honour,” said the man, as the hearing came to an end. Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Andrew Agius prosecuted. Lawyer Martin Fenech was legal aid counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Father apologises and settles bill with €250 donation after Msida dine-and-dash
Body: The father of one of the youths involved in a dine-and-dash incident at a Msida establishment last week has apologised to the owner and settled the unpaid bill by donating €250 to a Gozitan charity at the restaurateur's suggestion.  The owners of the Italian restaurant Pasta and Co. told Times of Malta that five youths, aged around 17 years, ordered and ate a meal and then ran away without paying on Friday afternoon.   RELATED STORIES  One of the Sicilian owners recognised the youths as fellow Sicilians and said they spoke in a dialect typical of Ragusa. The restaurant’s co-owner contacted Il Corriere Di Ragusa which then carried a news report on the incident.  After reading the article, a man recognised his son from the pictures and contacted the owners to settle the bill.  "He was very apologetic and offered to pay the €100," the owner told Times of Malta on Monday.  "We told him to make a donation to Fondazzjoni Arka in Gozo and gave him their IBAN number. He called back and instead he donated €250." Arka Foundation is a church-run voluntary, non-governmental organisation that houses people with disabilities and promotes their welfare. The owner also told Times of Malta that an Italian 'knight of Malta' based in Ragusa had also called him after seeing the article, wishing to settle the bill. He told him it had already been settled, but also suggested to him to make a donation to Arka, and he agreed. The story echoes a similar one in Albania recently when Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni personally paid a bill of about $87 when four holidaying Italians were involved in a dine-and-dash incident in Berat, which was widely reported in Albania.

Title: Man jailed 10 times over drugs says he wants to kick the habit
Body: A 23-year old father who allegedly resorted to theft to fuel his drug addiction told a court on Monday that he wanted to kick the habit that had landed him in and out of jail ten times over the past nine years. “I’ve been like this since 2014. I’m tired. I want to get over this…I have a five-year old daughter and I want to be a better father,” said the man, a barber living in Gozo. His name was banned from publication for certain “sensitive” reasons made known to the court by both the prosecutors and the defence lawyer. He was tracked down as the suspect behind a mugging and two thefts in St Paul's Bay earlier this month. He was identified from CCTV. Upon arraignment on Monday, the young man pleaded not guilty to all three thefts, as well as holding one of the victims against his will, carrying a knife without a police licence and causing slight injuries. He also denied breaching bail and a probation order and relapsing. A request for bail was objected to since civilian witnesses, including an eye witness involved in the mugging, still have to testify. Moreover, investigations in relation to one of the incidents are still ongoing. The gravity of the alleged crimes was another ground for objection, argued Inspector Lydon Zammit, underlining the fact that the accused had a very serious drug problem that was the root of his criminal behaviour. The youth allegedly told police that he resorted to such behaviour when he ran out of money and found himself with his back to the wall. Although the accused had recently sought help, it was still a long way to go and he was not deemed sufficiently trustworthy to abide by bail conditions. Defence lawyer Beppe Darmanin countered that the accused had abided by previous court conditions but unfortunately certain circumstances had triggered such behaviour. That was when presiding Magistrate Leonard Caruana addressed the accused. “Would you abide by a treatment order if imposed by this court? I’m offering you this opportunity. But if you consent, you must stick to all conditions. You mustn’t breach the order or else you will face the consequences for that,” said the magistrate. “Yes I do,” replied the youth, saying that he “was tired” and wished to get on the right path “even for the sake of my five year old daughter.” In light of that commitment the court, whilst turning down the request for bail, issued a one-year treatment order, advising the accused to follow all instructions by the probation officer who would be there to help him. Inspectors Lydon Zammit, Stephen Gulia and Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyer Beppe Darmanin was defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man remanded in custody after 620 pills found in residence he shared with others
Body: A man was remanded in custody after the police allegedly discovered 50 ecstasy pills in his room during a raid of a Żebbuġ residence that yielded 620 pills. The police came across Ahmed Said Habazi, a 24-year-old Egyptian national during a search of the residence, home to suspects linked to a separate investigation.  The man arrived in Malta as an asylum seeker in 2019, and the police are still looking into the status of his residence.  During the search, a substantial amount of grey pills were found inside a wardrobe at the residence where the other suspects were allegedly living. Around 50 of them were found in cigarette packets in a bedroom which the accused identified as his room.  Those staying in the residence appeared to have access to all parts of the premises. The youth, who possibly knew about other matters currently being investigated by a magisterial inquiry, was arrested. Upon his arraignment on Monday, he pleaded not guilty to possession of ecstasy under circumstances denoting that the drug was not solely for his personal use as well as possessing the drug without the special written authorisation of the Superintendent of Public Health.  The youth, a stonemason, had cooperated throughout the investigation, pointed out prosecuting Inspector John Leigh Howard.  However, since the accused had no personal documents and no ties to Malta, the prosecution objected to his lawyer’s request for bail.  His legal aid lawyer, Martin Fenech, argued that the amount of pills found in the accused’s room was relatively small and there was doubt as to whether the rest of the drugs belonged to him. After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request for bail but urged the prosecution to produce civilian witnesses and to conclude investigations in respect of third parties.

Title: TM, voter fraud whistleblower in three-hour meeting with FCID: Arnold Cassola
Body: A whistleblower who exposed a suspected driving licence racket and claimed there is widespread voter fraud has released a detailed declaration to the police, independent election candidate Arnold Cassola said on Monday. Earlier this month, Cassola said the whistleblower had been forced to leave the country after his residence permit was unexpectedly revoked. The man, whom he refers to through the pseudonym Aziz, worked as a translator with Transport Malta by assisting candidates who spoke neither Maltese nor English during their driving exam. Cassola said Aziz wrote an e-mail to the police detailing a racket in which officials were assisting student drivers in cheating on their exam. This led to three people, TM director Clint Mansueto and officials Raul Antonio Pace and Philip Edrick Zammit, facing corruption charges. Then last week, in a court application the whistleblower alleged a criminal conspiracy through which ID cards belonging to deceased foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to other foreign residents, for them to vote for the Labour Party. The man says that “thousands of euros were paid” as part of the scheme. He claims to have a list of people involved in it. Identity Malta denied that ID cards of foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to foreign residents to vote for the PL.  On Monday, Cassola said the whistleblower released a detailed declaration, recorded audio-visually, to Financial Crimes Investigations Department senior officials, in the presence of lawyer Jason Azzopardi.    "In the course of the almost three-hour-long meeting, Aziz gave his version of what happened at TM and at Identity Malta, together with an account of his alleged meetings on these issues with high-level government officials and politicians.    "A number of documents will be presented forthwith by him to assist the police in their investigations," Cassola said.

Title: Reports of indecent exposure rose during pandemic
Body: Reports of indecent exposure increased in Malta when COVID-19 hit in 2020 and people were asked to stay indoors, police data shows. About 155 complaints have been lodged with the police over the last five years. The peak was in 2020, with 35 reports compared to 26 in 2019 and 27 in 2018. Similar numbers were reported over the last two years and, so far this year, there have been 12 reports. Police data does not distinguish between indecent exposure in public or at indoor places. Over recent weeks, Times of Malta received several reports of people naked or having sex in public places. But the increased concern was not reflected in the number of reports actually filed. In Malta, a person can be found guilty of a contravention of public order if they expose themselves naked or are indecently dressed in public places. Additionally, whoever commits “an offence against decency or morals, by any act committed in a public place or in a place exposed to the public” could be imprisoned for three months and fined.

Title: Man steals brother's passport to leave Malta
Body: A man who stole his brother's passport while he slept and then tried to use it to leave Malta has been handed a suspended jail term.  Syrian national Hajmosa Abdelaziz, 25, admitted to the charges when he appeared before Magistrate Victor Axiaq on Friday evening.  The man was apprehended at the Malta International Airport as he tried to use the passport to travel to Frankfurt Airport in Germany.  Police Inspector Frankie Sammut told the court that the accused admitted to having stolen his brother's passport while he was asleep. The brother did not know of his plans.  He explained that Adbelaziz has a German identity card which he used to travel to Italy, then to Sicily and on to Malta. He arrived 10 days ago to see his relatives. He told police he had a hearing in Germany for permanent residency and did not want to miss it. He did not have a passport and expressed remorse for what he had done. Sammut asked the court for an effective jail term but given his clean criminal record, Magistrate Axiaq imposed a six-month suspended jail term.  Lawyer Jason Grima was defence counsel.

Title: Youths stick restaurant owner with €100 bill in Msida dine and dash
Body: An Msida restaurant owner has been stuck with a €100 bill after a group of youths dined and dashed from the establishment on Friday afternoon.  The owners of the Italian restaurant Pasta and Co. told Times of Malta that the five youths, whom they estimated to be around 17 years old, sat down and ordered a full meal, with coffee, at around 3pm.  However, once the meal was winding down, one by one, they got up with the excuse of needing to go outside for a smoke and made a run for it once they were all outdoors.  Photo: Pasta & Co     Giacomo Giacalone, the Sicilian co-owner of the eatery, recognised the youths as fellow Sicilians and said they spoke in an Italian dialect typical of Catania.  He expressed disappointment over the incident, saying it flew in the face of the hard work they put into the restaurant.  “We work very hard, day and night to make ends meet. We produce fresh artisan pasta with great love and passion. I am a proud Italian, these people do not represent our nation,” Giacalone said.  The restaurant's co-owner Bertrand said it was worrying to see such behaviour from such young patrons, particularly as he had personally never experienced a dine-and-dash incident throughout his career.  “This doesn’t happen often and it's worrying to see, given that these people were so young,” he said.  “If they think that acts like these don’t matter and that they can get away with it, it's certainly not good," he said. The owners urged anyone who may have any information about the five individuals to contact the Msida police station.  A police spokesperson confirmed with Times of Malta that a police report has been filed over the incident and that an investigation into the matter is ongoing.  The incident comes hot on the heels of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ordering the Italian Embassy in Albania to cover the bill for a group of Italian tourists who had walked out on the bill in a restaurant in Berat.

Title: Youth behind bars after third brush with the law in eight months
Body: A teenager, who has had three brushes with the law since Christmas Eve, landed behind bars on Friday after allegedly breaching bail conditions.  Nineteen-year-old Brandon Cassar, from Marsa, ended back in court when he failed to turn up at the police station to sign the bail book.  Eight months ago he was charged over his alleged involvement in a case of attempted theft from customs stores and was granted bail. Barely two months later, Cassar was back in court, one bandaged arm in a sling, facing charges over his alleged involvement in a traffic accident while riding a motorbike that turned out to be stolen.  Police had been alerted to a three-vehicle collision on Marsa Road on Valentine’s Day. One of the vehicles was a Kymco motorcycle whose rider fled the scene right after the crash. Cassar, whose appearance matched the eyewitness' description of the motorcyclist, later turned up at Mater Dei Hospital, bearing injuries compatible with those suffered in a traffic accident.  On that occasion, the youth insisted that he had injured his arm when he fell down some stairs at home.  He was remanded in custody on that second arraignment but was granted bail at a later stage.  A few months down the line, Cassar failed to sign the bail. When police turned up at his residence on Thursday evening, the youth was not there even though it was past his curfew.  Later, at around 2am, police returned to the area after receiving information that the youth was heading home.  But upon sensing police presence, he allegedly fled the scene. He was eventually arrested and taken into custody.  Cassar was escorted to court on Friday afternoon, pleading not guilty to breaching two sets of bail conditions.  His lawyer Jose’ Herrera, argued that since police had already previously charged the accused with breaching the first bail decree, they could not do so again.  However, at this stage, no request for bail was made and the court, presided over by Magistrate Victor George Axiak, remanded the accused in custody.  Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa prosecuted.

Title: Man who allegedly groped boy, worked in Malta illegally, granted bail
Body: A man who denied sexually molesting a nine-year-old boy while his mum was browsing through a Mosta store has been granted bail after the minor testified in court.  Zhou Jiankang was also ordered to pay a €5,000 deposit and bind himself under a €25,000 personal guarantee. The 55-year-old Chinese national had been remanded in custody after being arraigned earlier this month.  That day, the court heard about the incident that allegedly took place inside a store on Independence Street on a Saturday afternoon when the boy went shopping with his mum. While the mother browsed through the store, the man allegedly groped the boy.  The child’s mother immediately alerted the police who, after speaking to the boy and his mother, also checked CCTV footage from the shop.  That footage left no room for doubt, prosecutors later told the court.  The man, whom court was told is a shopkeeper, pleaded not guilty to non-consensual sexual acts, defilement, slightly injuring the child, subjecting him to acts having a sexual connotation as well as causing the minor, deemed vulnerable because under the age of 15, fear of violence.  He was also charged with working in Malta illegally. Upon arraignment, the accused was assisted by a legal aid lawyer who requested bail, arguing that adequately stringent conditions could allay the prosecution’s fears.  Yet, bail was turned down particularly because the young victim and other witnesses were still to testify. The boy testified once proceedings continued and the accused - now assisted by his chosen lawyers - filed a fresh application for bail before the Criminal Court. When decreeing upon the matter, Madam Justice Edwina Grima took note of various factors including the circumstances of the case, the previous conduct of the accused as well as the fact that the alleged victim had since testified. Moreover, a protection order was in place in favour of the boy and his relatives.  The Attorney General’s sole objection to bail was the fear that the accused might abscond.  However, the court observed that although the accused was a foreigner who did not work in Malta, his son ran a local business and could thus provide his father with a place to live until this case was concluded.  A Maltese national who operated a well-established business also testified he had known the accused’s son for quite some years.  When all was considered, the court upheld the request, granting bail under various conditions including signing the bail book twice daily, not going out between 9pm and 7am, paying a deposit of €5,000 and binding himself under a €25,000 personal guarantee.  He also cannot approach the minor and his family. AG lawyer Cynthia Tomasuolo and Inspectors Godwin Scerri and Dorienne Tabone are prosecuting.

Title: Nicolas Sarkozy faces 2025 trial over alleged Libyan corruption
Body: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy will be tried in 2025 over allegations he took money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Ghaddafi to fund one of his election campaigns, prosecutors said Friday. The trial is set to hear explosive evidence that the rightwinger, along with 12 other co-defendants, conspired to take cash from the Libyan leader to illegally fund his victorious 2007 bid for the presidency. Sarkozy, who has faced a litany of legal problems since his one term in office, denies the Libyan allegations - the most serious he faces. The 68-year-old has already been convicted twice for corruption and influence-peddling in separate cases involving attempts to influence a judge and campaign financing.  Sarkozy has appealed against both judgements. Among the others facing trial over the alleged Libyan corruption are heavyweights such as Sarkozy's former right-hand man Claude Gueant, his then head of campaign financing Eric Woerth and former minister Brice Hortefeux. The investigation was sparked by revelations from the investigative website Mediapart which published a document purporting to show that Ghaddafi agreed to give Sarkozy up to €50 million.  The two leaders enjoyed surprisingly cordial ties, with Sarkozy letting the Libyan strongman pitch his Bedouin tent opposite the Elysee Palace on a state visit to France just months after his election. Sarkozy has been back in the news in recent weeks in France after publishing the second volume of his memoirs and suggesting that areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia after the Kremlin's invasion last year might need to be recognised as Russian. He also said that the annexed region of Crimea would remain Russian and that "any return to the way things were before is an illusion". Sarkozy took a lead role in negotiating Russia's partial withdrawal from Georgia after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion in 2008 and he and his prime minister, Francois Fillon, enjoyed friendly relations with the Kremlin leader. Sarkozy faces a separate probe into possible potential influence-peddling after he received a payment by Russian insurance firm Reso-Garantia of €3 million in 2019 while working as a consultant.

Title: Two years in prison for man who robbed cab driver at knifepoint
Body: A man who robbed a cab driver at knifepoint has been sentenced to two years in prison. Bratislav Makaric, a 34-year-old Serbian national, admitted in court to threatening and robbing the driver who had just ferried him from St Paul’s Bay to the Pembroke park and ride in the early hours of August 4.  Bolt driver Malcolm Camilleri had just completed the trip when the passenger seated behind him pulled out a carving knife and held it to his throat, demanding cash as well as the driver’s mobile phone and car keys. The thief later fled the scene, making off with some €400 in cash and his victim’s phone. Working off CCTV footage and information from the passenger's Bolt account, police identified Makaric as the suspect.  When faced with the allegations, he immediately admitted and also confessed that he had a gambling problem. He was arrested and charged with aggravated theft, unlawfully holding his victim against his will as well as carrying a knife without the necessary police licence. Upon arraignment on Saturday, the accused pleaded guilty. The court, presided over by magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit condemned him to a two-year effective jail term. He was also fined €120 for the unlawful possession of the weapon. Inspectors Lydon Zammit and Stephen Gulia prosecuted.

Title: Wigged thief steals empty cash register, then leads police to his house
Body: A man who walked out of jail two months ago is back behind bars after he stole a cash register drawer that turned out to be empty.    Darren Brincat, 43, confessed to being the wigged thief that made off with the worthless item from a Qormi fast food restaurant at the weekend.   “I’m guilty,” Brincat confessed after he was arraigned following investigations based on CCTV footage retrieved from the crime scene.   The video showed a man wearing a wig and wielding a pipe entering a fast food restaurant at around 3:30am on Sunday, jumping over the counter, and making off with a cash register drawer.   “Luckily, it was empty,” said Inspector Stephen Gulia, when Brincat was arraigned on Friday afternoon.   The money in the till had been put away safely before the thief struck.   The suspect drove off in a silver Opel Astra and although wearing a wig, his face was easily identifiable on CCTV footage especially since he was familiar to police who had handled previous cases against him in court.   To further confirm suspicions, investigators tracked the route taken by the getaway vehicle, and found that it led them right to the suspect’s front door in Qormi.   The driver then got out of the getaway vehicle and headed to a nearby garage. A bare chested man then returned, wearing the same shorts and flip flops worn by the wigged thief.   Two days before the fast food restaurant robbery, a person wearing the same top had stolen perfumes from a pharmacy in the same locality.   Police obtained an arrest warrant on Thursday.  Upon arraignment, Brincat pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated theft, holding a shop attendant against her will, threatened his victims during the attempted robbery as well as simple theft of perfumes.  He was further charged with relapsing.   The accused, who said that he was “boarded out,” stepped out of jail two months ago and in spite of working to reform himself, had once again given in to drugs, explained the prosecution when making submissions on punishment.  However he immediately cooperated so that the stolen items were retrieved and were being returned to their lawful owners.   His legal aid lawyer highlighted the early admission and full cooperation as well as the fact that the accused needed help to rehabilitate.   There was no request for bail and the accused was remanded in custody pending judgment later this month.   Inspectors Lydon Zammit, Stephen Gulia and James Mallia prosecuted.

Title: He brought them food. They hit him with a hammer and took his bike
Body: Two sixteen-year-old boys were granted bail after admitting to assaulting a food courier in broad daylight on Wednesday, punching and hitting him with a hammer before making off with his motorbike and mobile phone. The injured victim turned up at the Birżebbuġa police station at around 2.30 pm, reporting that he had just been assaulted while effecting a delivery at the car park outside the Marsaxlokk football ground. Upon arrival, the persons waiting for the delivery appeared to find fault with the food and that was when trouble brewed. The courier was punched by one of the aggressors, while the other suspect struck him with a hammer, damaging two of his teeth. The pair then made off with the victim’s motorcycle as well as his mobile phone. Police investigations immediately kicked off and one of the suspects was soon tracked down, starting off with information obtained from the courier company which had received the booking for the delivery. That information led investigators to one of the teenagers who first told police that he was homeless but later went to the police station accompanied by his mother and a lawyer. Once questioned, the minor admitted to his wrongdoing and subsequently led police to an abandoned house, situated in an alley, where the duo had hidden the bike. “It had already been sprayed in a different colour,” said prosecuting Inspector James Mallia. That fact indicated that this was not a case of a simple “joyride” but the aggressors’ criminal intent was present from the start, added the prosecutor. The first suspect led police to his partner in crime who also cooperated. The teens’ statements were recorded on Thursday evening, paving the path to their joint arraignment on Friday where they pleaded guilty to aggravated theft, holding their victim against his will, injuring him and attempted grievous bodily harm. They were also charged with suppressing the traces of their crime as well as entering third-party property. In light of the circumstances, their age, their untainted record, as well as their full cooperation with the police, the teenagers’ lawyers explained that they were admitting to the charges. Their relatives, present throughout the arraignment and visibly shaken, could hardly believe what had happened. “It’s a shock for the family too,” explained lawyer Veronique Dalli, who assisted one of the minors together with lawyer Dean Hili. “The time is now for him to be monitored so as to avoid ulterior incidents.” “He cooperated and told police all about this crazy act done in the folly of youth,” said lawyer Amadeus Cachia who assisted the second teen. Although this was a “most serious crime,” the accused both cooperated and probation would help to prevent similar incidents in future, the prosecutor agreed. The minors, one in jacket and tie, the other in jacket and open-necked shirt, stood silently as Magistrate Gabriella Vella read out the conditions whereby they were granted bail pending judgment which is to be delivered next week. They were to sign the bail book twice weekly and to abide by early curfew hours “which putting it plainly means that there is no going out in the evening,” warned the magistrate. Each was to deposit €200 and was bound under a personal guarantee of €10,000. “You must obey each condition, down to the least one….If you go wrong and breach them not only will you forfeit €10,200 each but you will likely serve time in prison and add on to your families’ troubles,” warned the magistrate. The court ordered a ban on the minors’ names. Inspector James Mallia prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli and Dean Hili, together with Amadeus Cachia were defence counsel.

Title: Over 100 to face Greek prosecutor over deadly football fan violence
Body: More than 100 people are due to appear before a Greek prosecutor on Wednesday in connection with a deadly brawl before a Champions League qualifier near Athens this week. A 29-year-old Greek man was stabbed and died in hospital after fans of AEK Athens and Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb clashed on Monday ahead of their teams' third-round qualifying match at the Nea Filadelfeia stadium. Police have arrested 104 people, including 94 Croats, six Greeks, an Albanian, an Austrian, a Bosnian and a German.  They are due to appear before the Athens prosecutor, spokeswoman Konstantina Dimoglidou told AFP. She added that most of the suspects were under 30 years old and included five men who were detained on Tuesday at the port of Igoumenitsa as they tried to flee to Italy. Greece's Ministry for citizen protection said fans threw stun grenades, stones, incendiary devices and other items near the stadium on the outskirts of the Greek capital.  Some were carrying bats and around 120 Dinamo Zagreb supporters were involved alongside Greek fans, police said.  Eight people were injured in addition to the single fatality. European football's governing body UEFA condemned "in the strongest possible terms the appalling incidents" and postponed the match scheduled for Tuesday, with August 18 or 19 the suggested new dates. Violence has marred a number of football matches in Greece.  After a stabbing death last year, the government increased the maximum sentence for fan violence from six months to five years.

Title: Two charged with attempted murder after man stabbed in the back
Body: Two Maltese men have been charged with attempted murder following a stabbing in Cospicua last weekend. Sean Grech, 33, and Johan Cassar, 34, both Cospicua residents, stand accused of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, unlawfully holding their victim against his will, carrying a weapon while committing a crime against the person and carrying an unlicenced knife. Both were also charged with relapsing while Grech was also charged with breaching two bail decrees. They both pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned before Magistrate Abigail Critien on Tuesday afternoon.   The two were among three men arrested and detained by the police after a 36-year-old Libyan man walked into Cospicua’s police station on Sunday morning, dripping blood. He told officers that he had been stabbed in the back at a house on Triq il-Madonna tal-Grazzja. He was rushed to hospital to be treated for life-threatening injuries. Inspector Kurt Farrugia later spoke to the alleged victim in hospital and his audiovisual statement was recorded on police bodycam. The man said that he had entered the home of Josef Grech and saw two other men, both Maltese. One was short and wore his hair in a ponytail, while the other was a taller man with a beard. He said he did not know who the two men were. The man said that when he stepped inside, one of the men approached from behind and drew a knife from behind his back. Spotting the knife, he asked "why?". But the other man just stabbed him on the back. The man said he managed to get out of the house and headed straight to the police station, to report the stabbing. The inspector told the court that when they went to the house, nobody answered their knock on the door. Police returned later with an arrest warrant and forced their way inside. Only Josef Grech was present. He told police about the other two people who were with him earlier on. Police arrested all three men, but opted to release Grech without charge. During Tuesday’s arraignment, defence lawyers argued that the victim’s recorded statement was not shown to their clients before they were questioned. The inspector explained that the bodycam footage was not yet available since a request for a copy had to be made through the police system. But he had explained everything to the accused and they knew exactly what they were facing, insisted Farrugia.   Lawyers for the two accused asked the court to appoint a psychiatrist to assess their mental state when being questioned by police, noting that their clients had refused legal assistance at the time and had drug addiction issues. Prosecutors objected to that “unorthodox” request, but the court upheld the request and appointed a psychiatrist to assess both accused. The court also ordered a pharmacist to take the necessary samples for drug tests. Defence lawyers did not request bail for the two accused, who were remanded in custody. Attorney general lawyer Ramon Bonett Sladden worked together with police inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Antonello Magri to prosecute. Lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Charles Mercieca represented the two accused.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Two men charged over Sunday streetfight in Qawra
Body: Updated 2.08pm Two men who brawled in Qawra on Sunday evening have been charged with injuring each other and damaging a parked car.  Desmond Sylvester, 24, and Stanley Ebende, 27, both Nigerian, pleaded not guilty to criminal charges when they were arraigned.  Sylvester suffered extensive, but not critical injuries during the Sunday fight, which occurred sometime between 6pm and 8pm.  Photos posted on social media on Sunday showed him lying on the ground on Annetto Caruana Street in a pool of blood. Ebende suffered injuries to the forehead, hand and left shoulder. His injuries were medically classified as slight.  Sylvester, who on Tuesday turned up in court with a bandaged forearm, stitching on his face and neck and wearing slippers, required surgery. His legal aid lawyer, Martin Fenech, said that he was actually the victim in this case. He argued that the other man was the real aggressor and this was a case of attempted murder. Sylvester claimed that the other man had inflicted injuries upon himself to make it seem that he was attacked, Fenech added.  Sylvester, who was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday, pleaded not guilty to grievous bodily harm, involuntary damage to a Peugeot vehicle, insults and threats, and wilful breach of public peace. Ebende, who was arraigned immediately after him, also pleaded not guilty to the same charges. Both men requested bail but prosecutors objected, arguing the men had few ties to Malta and no jobs.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Abigail Critien, turned down both men's bail request, noting the nature of the offences and saying it could not be assured that the men would remain in Malta if allowed out of custody. As his arraignment reached an end, Ebende insisted that he wanted his mobile phone back as he needed it to contact his family. His lawyer explained that prison authorities would help with that. Sylvester was represented by legal aid lawyer Martin Fenech while Ebende was represented by legal aid lawyer Mattia Felice.  Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Andrew Agius Bonello prosecuted.

Title: UK police arrest man after stabbing outside London museum
Body: Police in London arrested a man on Tuesday after a stabbing outside the British Museum which reportedly led to the evacuation of the popular tourist attraction. The incident unfolded at around 10am (0900 GMT) on the street bordering the southern perimeter of the world-famous site, according to London's Metropolitan Police. "Police have arrested a man on suspicion of grievous bodily harm following an incident," the force said. "A man was treated for a stab wound to the arm at the scene and taken by London Ambulance Service to hospital. "His condition is being assessed." The Met said it was "an isolated incident" and there was no remaining risk to the public.  "It is not being treated as terror-related," the force added, noting the immediate area may remain restricted "for much of today". The museum, which first opened its doors in 1759, was evacuated following the stabbing, according to British news outlets and social media posts.  The site, in the heart of the capital, is a huge draw for tourists, particularly in peak summer months such as August.

Title: Man accused of theft from apartment raises doubt over legal aid system
Body: A man accused of theft from a Santa Venera apartment on Tuesday questioned the reliability of the legal aid system, when the lawyer representing him in court was different to the one assisting him upon arrest. Jabi Abubaker, a 22-year-old Gambian national pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft, wilful damage to third-party property as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.  But before his refusal of the charges was registered by the court, the accused expressed doubt over the legal aid system and how it worked. Abubaker said that when arrested on Sunday, he had spoken to a female lawyer on duty, so when a different lawyer turned up to assist him in court on Tuesday, he thought the police were trying to foil him.  Abubaker would not talk to the new lawyer until the magistrate explained how the legal aid system works. "Just like you don't choose the magistrate before whom you are arraigned, you also don't choose the legal aid lawyer. "You have the right to choose any lawyer you want privately. But you have to pay for their services. Do you want a private lawyer? "asked Magistrate Abigail Critien. "No," Abubaker, who lives in Ħal Far, said. The arraignment continued after he spoke briefly to the lawyer.  Court was told the accused allegedly stole some  €4,000 to €5,000 and a passport from an apartment. He then transferred money via western union and also bought an expensive mobile phone and other items. There was no request for bail and he was remanded in custody. Inspector Ian Vella prosecuted.

Title: Malta's domestic violence problem: more than one high-risk case per day
Body: A new specialised team dedicated to evaluating high-risk domestic violence cases has had 74 cases land on its desk since launching less than two months ago.  The Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Meeting (MARAM) is made up of different entities that work directly with victims of domestic violence and their children. Its main role is to facilitate, monitor and evaluate cases of high-risk domestic violence victims and produce action plans to protect victims and their families.  It appears to have gotten off to a busy start: the unit has had 74 new cases of high-risk domestic violence referred to it since it started operating on June 13, its chairperson Ruth Sciberras said on Monday.  That is the equivalent of 1.35 referrals per day.  The introduction of the MARAM system was one of the recommendations by Judge Geoffrey Valencia in his inquiry into the femicide of Bernice Cassar. The Valenzia inquiry established that the state system had failed the mother-of-two because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.  Cassar had filed multiple police reports against her ex-husband Roderick before she was shot dead as she drove to work last November in Corradino. Roderick Cassar is pleading not guilty to her murder.  The inquiry recommended a system that provides a setup for sharing expertise and experience in handling high-risk cases.  MARAM was officially launched during a press conference titled ‘Safeguarding Victims of Domestic Violence’ organised by the Family Ministry on Monday.   Professionals who form MARAM come from different entities including, the Gender-Based Violence Unit within the Malta Police Force, Domestic Violence Services, the Victims Support Agency, the Department of Probation and Parole, and others.  MARAM chairperson Ruth Sciberras explained that each of those entities has designated an officer, to serve as a liaison. The unit has been designed in line with similar units set up in countries like the UK and Australia and its officers have received training in the UK.    The Bernice Cassar inquiry also pointed out that risk assessment tools used to determine the level of danger a particular domestic violence victim faces must be fixed or changed.  The tool, known as the DASH system - Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification - has faced a build-up of criticism ever since it was introduced in Malta back in 2018.  DASH assessment takes the form of 27 questions, with the focus being given on the reporting incident as well as past incidents.  The score is based on the total number of ‘yes’ ticks following the disclosures made by the alleged victim. One to nine ‘yes’ ticks result in a standard risk, while 10-13 results in medium risk. More than 14 ticks indicate a high risk. The DASH system found that Cassar only faced a ‘medium risk’.  Prior to the publication of the inquiry, a social welfare spokesperson told Times of Malta that there were no plans to replace the system, despite numerous reports calling for the adoption of other risk assessment tools.    During Monday’s press conference, a study commissioned by the Family Ministry evaluating the DASH Risk assessment tool was presented.  The review, titled ‘Evaluation of the evidence on the DASH Risk assessment tool- A scoping review’ was carried out by Clarissa Sammut Scerri, a warranted counselling psychologist. Apart from noting the key limitations of DASH, the study also delved into other risk assessment tools Malta could adopt, with a particular focus on the Danger Assessment (DA) tool.  Originally created in the USA, it has been adopted and used in different EU states such as Germany, Italy, Austria, and Portugal. Sammut Scerri's study describes the DA as the only risk assessment tool specifically designed to predict homicide, severe assault, or attempting femicide.  She said that while there is no perfect tool, and risk assessment tools provide probabilities and not certainties, she said the DA seems a promising reliable tool that can assess for risk of femicide, re-assault, and risk of severe re-assault.  Although the government has not officially committed to introducing the DA assessment locally, Sammut Scerri said a number of specialists are currently undergoing training focused on using it.  Family Minister Michael Falzon was also present during the press conference.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Fired Gżira restaurant manager turns up at former workplace wielding breadknives
Body: A man who lost his job as manager of a Gżira restaurant on Saturday morning returned to the eatery hours later drunk and wielding two breadknives. Pierre Walton had just told his sister he was going to kill his former employer, court heard on Monday.  The 53-year-old man from Gżira was escorted to court under arrest to face charges over the incident that took place at 6.40pm on Saturday. Earlier that day, he was fired following an argument with his employer after he turned up for work drunk. Walton went home where he allegedly told his sister that he was going to kill his former employer. He grabbed two breadknives and headed out again.  His worried sister alerted the police who went to the restaurant, where they found the accused. The man was arrested. On Monday Walton was escorted to court, charged with causing his victims to fear violence, carrying a knife in public without the necessary police licence, wilfully breaching the public peace, being drunk in public as well as insults and threats.  The man registered an admission which he confirmed after being given time to reconsider and after consulting his lawyer.  In light of his early guilty plea, the court presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, placed the accused under a three-year probation order and condemned him to pay a €200 fine.  The court also issued a Protection Order in favour of the employees and management of the commercial establishment where the incident took place.  Inspector Jonathan Ransley prosecuted. Lawyers Rene’ Daramanin and Alfred Abela were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Cab driver claims passenger robbed him at knifepoint
Body: A cab driver was threatened at knifepoint by his own passenger early on Friday, before making off with around €400 in cash and a mobile phone. Bolt driver Malcolm Camilleri, a father of two, said he had just completed a trip from St Paul’s Bay to Pembroke park-and-ride when the passenger sitting in the seat behind him pulled out a carving knife and held it to his throat. The man demanded cash, his mobile phone and car keys while holding the edge of the knife blade against Camilleri’s neck. On three occasions he pressed the tip into his throat, asking, “Do you want problems?” After taking the cash and phone, the man fled the scene on foot. The alleged thief is believed to be in his mid-30s and speaks with an Eastern European accent, according to Camilleri, who managed to conceal some of his cash from the assailant and retain his keys. The stolen mobile phone was later found on the floor near a BCRS machine at Pembroke Park and Ride after a woman who had gone to feed cats in the area heard it ring. The passenger had told Camilleri that his “friend” had booked the trip, which was supposed to have been settled in cash. Camilleri believes the robber could be the same as another thought to be acting suspiciously by other drivers. In CCTV footage shown to Times of Malta, a man can be seen climbing into a different cab on July 31 in the same seating position as the man in Friday morning’s alleged incident. Upon realising he is being recorded, the man appears to hide his face behind the driver headrest while moving his hands around him.   According to Camilleri, “it’s an 80 per cent chance it’s the same guy”, though he noted the man in Friday morning’s incident was partially covering his face with a piece of cloth when he got into his car. A police spokesperson confirmed that a police report had been filed and the incident was being investigated. The Light Passenger Operators Association has received three reports of ride-hailing drivers who have been threatened with violence by passengers in the past few days. The association urged the authorities to introduce mandatory driver assistance systems across all ride-hailing apps. “The association strongly believes this is symptomatic of a wider problem in the industry... At present, only one of the major platforms in Malta, eCabs, operates a round-the-clock helpline which drivers can turn to in case of an emergency,” it said. The association called for a dedicated support service with Transport Malta and a dedicated in-app panic button feature for drivers. A spokesperson for Bolt said they had been informed of Friday’s incident and were cooperating with the police in their investigation. The company added that its driver app features an ‘SOS’ button, which immediately places a call to emergency services, and GPS-tracked location reporting for drivers. The company will be announcing further safety features in the coming weeks. Recently, Times of Malta reported that an Uber driver had been robbed by three passengers who ran away with €400 and debit cards that were in his backpack.

Title: Jean Paul Sofia inquiry to begin on Thursday
Body: The public inquiry probing the circumstances leading to the death of Jean Paul Sofia in a building collapse last December will be holding its first hearing at the Valletta Law Courts on Thursday. The board announced the first hearing in a press call issued on Monday morning. The public inquiry will investigate the government’s land transfer to developers behind the Corradino construction site tragedy, as well as the state’s broader responsibility in protecting workers at building sites from harm.  Terms of reference for the public inquiry were presented last week, two weeks after the independent probe was announced. The terms were signed by Prime Minister Robert Abela following negotiations with Sofia’s family. Abela has given the public inquiry board five months to do the job, although it has been empowered to request an extension should it need one. The public inquiry will look into the specifics leading to the December 2022 Corradino construction site, including the way that AllPlus Ltd, the company behind the development, was handed a lease to build a timber factory at the government-owned Corradino Industrial Estate. It has also been given the broader remit of investigating construction-related laws and health and safety regulations, to assess whether the Maltese state did enough to ensure construction site safety and protect workers from harm. Three days after a copy of the final report is given to the Prime Minister and Jean Paul Sofia's family, the report will be published and tabled in parliament. The inquiry must take into account the findings and conclusions of a magisterial inquiry into the collapse, led by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia. The inquiry will hear witnesses at the law courts. Proceedings will be public, save for instances when the board of inquiry chooses otherwise due to the sensitivity of witness testimony, for data protection reasons or to avoid prejudicing other legal proceedings. The three-person board will be led by former judge Joseph Zammit McKeon with Auditor General Charles Deguara and architect Mario Cassar as members. Five people have been charged with Sofia's involuntary homicide and the grievous injury of five others as a result of the collapse: the project's two developers, Matthew Schembri and Kurt Buhagiar; its architect Adriana Zammit; contractor Milomir Jovicevic and his wife Dijana, in her capacity as a company director.

Title: Three arrested after man stabbed in the back in Cospicua
Body: A man was allegedly stabbed in the back at a Cospicua residence on Sunday by three people who have since been arrested. The police said the 36-year-old man was stabbed at around 8.15am at a residence on Triq il-Madonna tal-Grazzja. He managed to make it to the police station, where he told police he had just been assaulted. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital, where he was found to have suffered serious injuries. It transpired the man was injured following an argument at the residence. The three alleged aggressors fled the scene.  Later, two men aged 33 and another man aged 34, all from Cospicua, were arrested and detained at the Floriana lockup. Magisterial and police investigations are ongoing.

Title: Group of youths attack Sliema McDonald’s staff
Body: A group of young people attacked staff at a McDonald’s restaurant in Sliema,  with some workers suffering minor injuries in the incident. Staff members were trying to calm the group, who were being “rowdy and disrupting guests”, when the incident took place, a McDonald’s spokesperson said. One man who was in the restaurant at the time said the aggressors jumped over the counter to beat staff and break things.  “The group only left after they threw trays all over the place,” he said.  The incident occurred on Thursday evening, when the group of youths started to argue loudly and staff members stepped in to defuse the situation, the spokesperson said.  “As the matter escalated, the police were called in and the necessary reports were filed with the authorities.” The police report says the youths were aggressive towards McDonald’s staff and their aggression then turned physical. The police said that by the time they arrived, the group had already left the premises. They said no one required medical care. An investigation is under way. The McDonald’s spokesperson said: “As the operators of McDonald’s, our foremost priority is to ensure the safety of our people and our guests.” She said all employees are trained to handle such incidents, and all relevant procedures were followed on the night.   “The company also deploys additional security personnel on busier days, including weekends,” she added.

Title: Italian fugitive in Greece betrayed by football fever
Body: A fugitive on Italy's most-wanted list has been caught in Greece after he was snapped celebrating a historic win by his football team, Italian police said Saturday. Vincenzo La Porta, 60, had been on the run for 11 years, and is "considered to have close ties" to the Camorra organised crime organisation in the southern Italian city of Naples, a police statement said. He was sentenced in absentia to 14 years in prison for his role in a group skilled in tax evasion and fraud. Police in Naples said they "never gave up" (searching for him) and "waited for him to make a misstep". "Then they found him, on the Greek island of Corfu. What betrayed him was his passion for football and for Napoli", police said. After 33 years of waiting, Napoli in May won its first Serie A title since the days of Diego Maradona. "La Porta could not help but celebrate. The police recognised him in a photo taken outside a restaurant," in which the fugitive could be seen holding aloft a scarf in the team's white and blue colours. He was wearing a baseball cap, but investigators were sure they had their man. With help from their Greek colleagues, police began tailing La Porta. He was then stopped as he rode his scooter, and arrested. Greek police said the arrest took place Friday.     You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Two jailed for attacking Sliema jogger on seafront
Body: Two men have been jailed for 42 months between them after pleading guilty to having attacked and seriously injured a man while he was jogging on the Sliema front in June last year. The two attackers, Albanian nationals Xhovano Ndoci, 23, and Agostin Marku, 23, were jailed for 20 months and 22 months respectively after they filed an admission at the end of the compilation of evidence against them. Magistrate Victor Axiak also fined them €116 each, ordered them to pay court expenses and issued a restraining order in favour of the victim, against a €7,000 fine in default.  The two were arrested shortly after the June 2022 assault, when a fellow jogger chased them down and pinned them to the ground.  They subsequently told the police that they had been commissioned to carry out the attack. Police have said that Matthew Joseph Schembri was the "brains" behind the unprovoked assault. The jogger who was assaulted is the father of Schembri's ex-wife. Schembri, who is facing separate criminal proceedings for involuntary homicide as one of the developers behind a Corradino Industrial Estate collapse that killed 20-year-old Jean Paul Sofia, was initially arraigned along with Ndoci and Marku.  After the two Albanian men changed their plea to guilty, the prosecution requested a separation of judgment so that the court could proceed with sentencing the two men while the case against Schembri continues separately. Lawyer Dean Hili was defence counsel to Ndoci while layer Charles Mercieca represented Marku. Lawyer Matthew Xuereb appeared parte civile for the victim.

Title: Magistrate orders inquiry into No Deposit Cars
Body: Updated 11.15am Magistrate Elaine Rizzo has ordered a magisterial inquiry into allegations involving No Deposit cars and its directors. The decision was made after an application by several clients of the company against Christian Borg, Joe Camensuli, Luke Milton, Thorne Mangion, James Spiteri and Tyson Grech. In their application the clients listed alleged illegalities including money laundering, fraud, involvement in a criminal association, aggravated theft, violence against private individuals, stalking, VAT evasion and computer misuse. One of the applicants recalled an episode which took place while driving through Naxxar one day in March 2021.  RELATED STORIES  His vehicle was blocked by Milton and Mangion who forcibly dragged him out of the car he had acquired on hire purchase from the company. They drove off in his car, telling him that he was late on payments. Next day, when he turned up at the company's offices explaining that he had fallen back on some payments because of COVID-19 and lockdown, he was told that the “contract is now cancelled, go home.” The woman for whom that car had been purchased received a letter from Princess Holdings saying that she owed them “lots of money.” She was so scared that she went and paid the sum “up to the last cent,” even though certain payments were not owed.  RELATED STORIES  Another episode referred to in the application allegedly took place some six years ago. The applicants claimed that Milton and Borg had instructed two men, a Serbian and a Maltese, to kidnap a Maltese youth to force him into signing some bills of exchange. The two hitmen pounced upon the youth while he was walking in the street, dumped him into the luggage boot of their car, tied his hands and placed a cover over his head. The youth was taken to an Mqabba garage where he was tied to a chair, beaten and ultimately forced to sign 18 bills of exchange for €18,000. (In a separate case in January last year, Christian Borg, Thorne Mangion, Tyson Grech were among five men accused of abduction, holding the victim against his will, stealing up to €1,000 in cash, stealing a mobile phone, criminal conspiracy and making threats beyond the limits of provocation.) It was also claimed that Borg and his associates were allegedly involved in a criminal web that included unidentified officials from LESA and Transport Malta. That organisation was behind a number of crimes including bribery, corruption and misuse of electronic equipment, the applicants’ claimed. Borg was also allegedly involved in a number of suspicious manoeuvres concerning “black bags, like garbage bags,” stuffed with cash, all euro banknotes. This allegedly happened after 2019 when Borg would turn up outside the airport in his black Land Rover, soon to be joined by his associate Grech. Black bags, stuffed with cash “definitely far above” the €10,000 statutory limit in terms of cash control regulations, would be transferred to Grech’s car. This suspect operation allegedly took place once or twice a week, claimed the applicants, linking that to alleged money laundering activity by Borg and his associates. The applicants drew a parallel to similar requests for a magisterial inquiry made by NGO Repubblika in relation to the Vitals deal and another one over alleged trading in influence in passport sales. The application was signed by lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta. Borg came to public prominence in early 2022 as a result of a separate legal issue, when he and a number of his associates were criminally charged with having abducted a man in Rabat.  RELATED STORIES  The case shone a spotlight on Borg and his vast wealth, with investigators suspecting that his business operations were part of a criminal conspiracy involving money laundering and the dark web – parts of the internet that cannot be accessed through search engines.   It then emerged that Borg had in the past been involved in a convoluted property deal with Robert Abela which netted the now-prime minister €45,000. Abela has insisted there was “nothing strange” about the deal and said it was his only business involvement with Borg. MEP David Casa, who had also submitted an application asking the courts to order a probe into Borg and his company, said he was pleased to see the development.  He said the court-ordered probe was yet another example of the police force failing to do its duty.  “Citizens should not have to go to court to have criminals investigated, more so when evidence is already public. There is no justification for the police’s failure to act when the Financial Crimes Investigations Unit had been in possession of the facts for several months," he said. "The authorities must be faster to protect citizens from criminality. Instead they protect criminals who are close to people in power”.

Title: ‘Lilu King' spent €3.8k in cash on clothes in six months, court told
Body: Police monitoring the behaviour of a man suspected of drug trafficking uncovered a €3,815 spending spree at a Tigne’ clothes store over a six-month span. However, the same monitoring did not yield evidence to support drug charges against Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, known as ‘Lilu King', a police officer testified on Monday.  Superintendent Keith Arnaud took the witness stand at the compilation of evidence against Elmushraty, a Paceville entrepreneur and social media influencer, who was arraigned in May and remanded in custody alongside two other suspects allegedly involved in organised crime, mainly linked to drug trafficking and money laundering.  Early this year, the police set up a task force to monitor the suspect on a daily basis, logging in all their findings, while a parallel investigation about the man was launched by the financial crimes unit.  But while officers noted Elmushraty’s luxurious lifestyle in Malta, FCID reported that the suspect had nothing to his name on the island, did not work and was practically “a ghost".  For three whole months, police kept a close watch on the man including when he was in the company of people known by the police as pertaining to drug trafficking circles.  Arnaud said he was present when officers searched the Portomaso apartment where Elmushraty was living.  That was where the police seized a considerable amount of shoes, slippers, trainers, jewellery and branded items of clothing.  None of the luxurious vehicles he drove, including a Range Rover with a “Lilu King” registration plate and a Mercedes vehicle with a “One King” registration plate, were registered on his name.  When questioned about his work, Elmushraty had told police that he previously used to operate a shop on St Rita’s Steps, Paceville, and was in the process of opening another shop at the Vittoriosa waterfront.  Lilu King was a regular at a Tigne’ clothes shop where employees of the store described him as a “particular customer”, who opted for cash instead of payment by bank card.  Between November and May, he went shopping for clothes eight times, spending €3,815 in total. Throughout the investigation, Maltese police also set up contact with Libyan authorities who wanted Elmushraty over crimes allegedly committed in Libya.  Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Franco Debono, Arnaud confirmed that investigations had not yielded evidence justifying drug trafficking charges against the accused.  However, knowing how organised crime worked, there were individuals who “never touch drugs” and yet were involved in drugs, added Arnaud.  “However, despite logging in information on a daily basis for three months, there was nothing to charge him with drugs, right," asked Debono.  “No. Agreed. If there were, we would have charged him.” The witness also confirmed that no drugs had been found anywhere in the accused’s possession.  He also did not recall any drug convictions or pending drug cases in respect of Elmushraty.  Earlier in Monday’s sitting, Luke Chetcuti, as CEO of Hugo’s hospitality group and landlord of a number of Paceville establishments, testified about a 10-year lease agreement signed with a third party whose name was previously banned by the court.  The agreement was signed in August 2019 in respect of the establishment that was to house a Middle Eastern restaurant, later operated as a lounge bar and shisha bar.  Rent was paid by transactions from the third party’s account and was also occasionally paid in cash, some three or four times by “il-Lillu” whom the witness identified and referred to as the third party’s “employee”.  He had known the accused “out and about in Paceville”.  However, he had no knowledge of the relationship between the accused and the third party.  Nor had he anything to do with the way the establishment was operated, explained Chetcuti.  The last rental instalment was paid in June last year.  After facing difficulties in the payment of rent, the lessor received a letter from the lessee requesting the termination of the lease.  The matter subsequently ended up in court.  During Monday's hearing, defence lawyer Debono minuted that during a previous sitting the court had passed a comment about the ‘hawala’ system in the sense that this was an illegal banking system. By doing so, the Court had pronounced itself on the merits of the case and that could be a serious ground for recusal of the sitting magistrate, added Debono, pointing out that ‘hawala’ was acknowledged as a banking system in several countries.  Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech explained that the system was considered illegal in Europe and had only commented in that sense to avoid possible prejudice against the accused through the defence’s line of questioning in a previous session when the subject cropped up.  However, Debono insisted that the system was “very central to the case” and also to the defence’s arguments.  AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici countered that the magistrate had in no way pronounced herself on the merits of the case nor on the guilt or otherwise of the accused.  Thus, there was no ground for recusal.  As the sitting drew to an end, the prosecution requested the court to send the records of the case back to the AG’s office. That would signify a six-week time window before the next sitting.  The defence objected, requesting the court to fix another hearing at a closer date so that the prosecution might produce more substantial evidence while pointing out that the accused was still in preventive custody.  The court upheld the defence’s request and appointed another hearing in August.  Inspectors Tonjoe Farrugia and Alfredo Mangion prosecuted together with AG lawyers Antoine Agius Bonnici and Dejan Darmanin. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man accused of punching partner, pulling out her hair over hacking suspicions
Body: A man who allegedly beat his partner following suspicions that she had hacked his mobile phone, was remanded in custody on Monday.  Simon Gordon Hegarty, a 40-year-old Mosta resident, was escorted to court after having been arrested over the incident that allegedly took place in the early hours of Saturday.  Court heard how the couple started arguing inside a car. The man allegedly punched his partner in the face and pulled out tufts of hair from several places.  He later told police that his partner had allegedly hacked his mobile phone while he was abroad. He also appeared to harbour other suspicions in her regard.  Upon arraignment on Monday, Hegarty pleaded not guilty to wilfully inflicting grievous injury upon the alleged victim, causing her to fear violence as well as relapse.  A request for bail was objected to by prosecuting inspector Sherona Buhagiar who highlighted the gravity of the charges, which carried a maximum jail term of 10 years. The victim herself was still to testify, and thus the fear of tampering with evidence was real, the inspector argued.  Lawyer Franco Debono, representing the alleged victim in the proceedings, explained that images of the woman indicated facial injuries that were “not at all pleasant”. His client did not want any sort of contact with the accused, added Debono.  After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Astrid May Grima, turned down the request for bail in view of the serious nature of the case and the fact that civilian witnesses were still to testify.  The court upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the alleged victim and also issued a ban on the woman’s name.  A similar ban sought for the accused was, however, turned down.  Lawyer Joseph Bonnici was defence counsel. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri appeared parte civile.

Title: Carmen Ciantar returns to FMS, saying truth has prevailed over bribery claims
Body: Carmen Ciantar has decided to return to her post as CEO of the Foundation for Medical Services, saying in a statement on Monday that "truth and my integrity have won out over the massive and moneyed dark forces which tried to annihilate both." Ciantar had suspended herself from her job after a Pakistani newspaper two months ago claimed she was the beneficiary of a huge bribe by the people behind Vitals Healthcare, at a time when the company was negotiating the hospitals deal with the government. The Daily Pakistan had claimed that a company linked to Sri Ram Tumuluri, the CEO of UK-based Causis Group and a director of VGH, made several undeclared payments to a senior Maltese official linked to the 2015 hospitals deal.  The report said Ciantar received a total of €443,500 from Gozo International Medicare Ltd’s account at the Dubai-headquartered Emirates NBD Bank.  RELATED STORIES  Ciantar always denied the claims, also pointing out that she was not employed by the foundation at the time.  Days later, a separate allegation appeared on a Ukrainian blog, alleging that Ciantar's daughter received €3.2 million from a wealthy Russian who, it was alleged, had been helped by Health Minister Chris Fearne to acquire a passport.  That allegation was recirculated by a Brussels-based website that has been linked to disinformation campaigns. Ciantar has since testified in a magisterial inquiry concerning the hospital privatisation deal and urged police to investigate the corruption claims.  Police have not charged her with any crime and it is not known whether they probed the allegations.  "When the totally false but grave allegations about me and my daughter hit the headlines I immediately suspended myself from the post of CEO at FMS to be able to fully and serenely defend my integrity, that of the Health Ministry and the entire government," Ciantar said in a statement on Monday. "I then went to the Police Commissioner as well as to the Magistrate scrutinising the VGH and Steward contracts to offer them my full and transparent cooperation in all the investigations they wished to conduct. And that’s what they did. "I walked in with head held high and that’s how I walked out. "Today, two months after this horrible ordeal started, I stand tall. As a lone individual, as a woman, I managed to thwart the evil plans of dark and hidden forces which are much, much bigger than me."  RELATED STORIES  She thanked her daughter, family, friends and colleagues at FMS who stood by her. She said that terrible as this experience was and despite the heavy toll it took on her, it nevertheless strengthened her confidence that truth and integrity cannot be vanquished.

Title: Malta Philharmonic suspends its principal conductor
Body: The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended its principal conductor,  Mro Sergey Smbatyan following international media reports that he has been arrested in Armenia on fraud allegations.

"The MPO is following the case very closely to ascertain the facts. A final decision in respect of this case will be taken once the relevant facts and circumstances are ascertained," Muscat said in a statement. Smbatyan was appointed principal conductor of the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) on 1 January 2022.   According to media reports, Smbatyan, who is artistic director and chief conductor of the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra, is being held with his father Armen, in connection with an alleged real-estate fraud involving land belonging to the Tchaikovsky Music School in the capital, Yerevan.

Title: Man denied bail over importation of drugs from Sicily
Body: A suspected drug courier was remanded in custody on Sunday after pleading not guilty to the importation of some 7kg of suspected cocaine and 100 grams of cannabis hidden inside his van as he crossed over from Sicily to Malta. Before Magistrate Rachel Montebello, Ryan Cutajar, 37, from Fgura, pleaded not guilty to importing the drugs on and before July 28. Police inspector Alfredo Mangion explained that the man was stopped as he disembarked from the catamaran in Malta on Friday night. Police searched the Ford Transit van he was driving and found the drugs stashed in the axle of one of the van’s rear wheels. Authorities have placed an estimated street value of more than €400,000 on the drug haul. The inspector said the police investigation began following a tipoff that Cutajar may be involved in drug trafficking between Malta and Sicily. On July 21, the police obtained an arrest warrant on the basis of the information they had received. Police investigations revealed that he was leaving Malta, cutting off all contact even by turning off his mobile phone. Therefore, upon his return to Malta by catamaran on Friday night, the police pounced and searched his vehicle. During the search, the police found that there was a welded channel behind the rear wheel so they cut it open and found a stash of drugs. They found a bag containing 16 smaller bags of suspected cocaine amounting to some 7.5 kilograms as well as some cannabis resin. Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri requested release from arrest. However, the prosecution objected due to the gravity of the crime even though there are no witnesses. Debono explained that once there were no civilian witnesses, there was no fear that any evidence could be tampered. The accused has all ties to Malta, with his mother also present in court. He insisted that the court must grant bail and balance any fear it may have through the conditions that will be imposed. Moreover, the prosecution must bring evidence in support of the fears it says it has. But Magistrate Montebello denied the request since the court was not convinced there were no fears of tampering with evidence as the defence was suggesting. He was, therefore, remanded in custody.

Title: Cocaine discovered in prisoner's cell toilet
Body: An inquiry has been launched after cocaine was discovered in the toilet of an inmate’s cell at the Corradino Correctional Facility, Times of Malta has confirmed. An undisclosed amount of white substance, believed to be cocaine, was found during random checks inside the prison cells earlier this week. A spokesperson for the Correctional Services Agency said the drug was discovered during routine inspections in Division 3. Immediate action was taken with a police report being filed at the Paola Police Station as well as internal action in line with the agency’s standard operating procedures. The inmate in question was transferred to another division until investigations are concluded. His transfer to solitary confinement could not be immediately confirmed although this is usually the standard practice. “The Correctional Services Agency practices a zero tolerance to drugs inside prison and works hard, together with other entities, to provide drug rehabilitation to inmates. Illicit substances hinder the rehabilitative process and CSA cannot condone that,” the spokesperson told Times of Malta when asked. She explained how routine testing is used to establish whether inmates made use of any illicit substance. The discovery showed how “the systems in place to detect illicit drugs had worked again,” the spokesperson said. “The Correctional Services Agency will continue its fight against the presence of drugs in prison not only to preserve the optimum results achieved but above all to safeguard all inmates,” she added. Last year, a prison warden resigned from his job after testing positive for cocaine during a routine urine test among prison officials. According to information tabled in parliament last year, a total of 15 prison inmates tested positive for drugs in 2021. Answering a parliamentary question by PN MP Beppe Fenech Adami, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said 3,347 drug tests were carried out in 2021, resulting in 15 positive cases. The drug positivity rate when compared to the amounts of tests carried out stood at 0.45%, Camilleri said.   Drugs were rampant in prison prior to the appointment of controversial CCF director Alex Dalli, who was praised for weeding out drugs from Corradino although he had come under fire for his unorthodox methods of discipline, which reportedly included a poster that told officials to “teach fear” and a restraining chair to which unruly inmates were strapped.  Suicides in prison quadrupled under Dalli’s tenure. A former army colonel, Dalli had run the prison since 2018 until he was forced to resign at the end of 2021 following a spate of prison deaths. Dalli had told a court in July 2019 that there were no drugs in prison.  Dalli had been replaced by Robert Brincau but his appointment was short-lived, having to resign shortly after a court found him guilty of holding a gun to a man’s head at Għadira Bay last summer. Christopher Siegersma, a psychiatric nurse, was appointed in his stead. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Police foil students’ attempted escape to mainland Europe
Body: The police have foiled an attempt by a group of Vietnamese students who came to Malta to study English but attempted to flee towards mainland Europe using forged passports, a court heard on Friday. Police Inspector Hubert Gerada detailed the plan during the arraignment of three students aged 18 and 23, who came for a four-month English language course but were arrested at the airport, having tried to board a flight to France with a fake passport. He explained that this was the culmination of several weeks of investigation following a tipoff that Vietnamese students were planning to reach mainland Europe after coming to Malta on a student visa. He said that as part of the police investigation, the police had identified a total of 160 students from Vietnam who are currently in Malta to study English and proceeded to collect all their passports. One language school told the police that they had 21 students who were meant to leave Malta earlier this week but only six had turned up for their flight back home. The rest were nowhere to be found. Nguyen Thi Nhung, 23, as well as Phan Van Tai and Nguyen Van Cuong, both of whom are 18 years old, admitted to attempting to use a forged passport to leave Malta and were each jailed for six months by Magistrate Victor Axiak. Lawyer Mario Caruana assisted the accused. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Homeless man admits to robbing bathers in St Julian’s
Body: A homeless and unemployed man was remanded in custody on Friday until sentencing next week after he pleaded guilty to robbing bathers as they relaxed by the beach in St Julian’s. The dishevelled 25-year-old appeared before Magistrate Victor Axiaq charged with robbing two tourists in Dragonara on Monday morning. Police Inspector Zachary Zammit told the court that the police started to investigate the case after receiving a report about the theft. The victims said the man walked up to them and threatened them to give him all they had. They did not report seeing any weapons. He made off with some €100 in cash. The police started to analyse CCTV footage after the victims described the thief in certain detail, including the tattoo he had on his leg. The man was arrested later that day. When asked by the court where he lived, he replied: “On the streets”. Asked whether his parents were dead or alive – a standard question during an arraignment – he replied: “I have no clue, I haven’t spoken to them for the last eight years”.    He also admitted to holding the victims against their will, living a vagabond life and relapsing. Magistrate Axiaq deferred the case to Wednesday when he will deliver his judgment.

Title: Charged with sexually abusing boys aged 8 and 11
Body: A man was remanded in custody on Thursday after pleading not guilty to sexually abusing two brothers, aged 11 and 8, over the past two months. The 36-year-old man, whose name cannot be published by court order so as to protect the identity of the two children, was reported to the police by their father after he observed the man, who was his friend, make advances at them. He told the police that he spoke to his boys who confirmed what the accused used to do to them. Police inspector Gabriel Kitcher told Magistrate Noel Bartolo that the man was arrested on Tuesday afternoon following an arrest warrant issued by the duty magistrate. No details were given in court but the prosecution strongly objected to bail being granted. The court turned down the bail request due to the accused's familiarity with the boys and their relatives, the serious nature of the charges and the fear of absconding. Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel. Lawyer Roberta Bonello Felice appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 70-year-old charged with groping two students
Body: A 70-year-old man who was hosting English language students at his home was on Thursday charged with sexually harassing two French girls. Mario Farrugia, from Birkirkara, pleaded not guilty to committing a non-consensual sexual act on the two students and subjecting them to unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature. Before Magistrate Noel Bartolo, police Inspector Joseph Busuttil told the court that the girls filed a report at the police station claiming that the man had grabbed their bottoms on two separate occasions. The girls had been living with the defendant for around five days, in the two-bedroom apartment where he lived with his wife. The two girls testified via video conferencing with one claiming that the pensioner had touched her as she was making her way to her room. She described how the incident made her feel scared since she had only been living there since her arrival five days previously. The second girl told the court that he had done the same thing to her a few days earlier. They discussed the incident with their group leader who took them to the police station to file a report. The language school where the girls were attending their English language lessons told the police that the host family had worked with the school for around two years and that no complaints or reports had been filed about them. Farrugia was granted bail against a €500 deposit and a €4,500 personal guarantee. He was ordered to sign the bail book twice a week. Inspectors Joseph Busuttil and Andrew Agius Bonello prosecuted, assisted by prosecutor Sean Azzopardi from the Attorney General’s office. Lawyer Ishmael Psaila was defence counsel.

Title: Probation for man who stabbed motorist in fit of road rage
Body: A Floriana man has been placed on probation for two years after he was found guilty of stabbing another motorist following a traffic accident that boiled over in March 2020. Leandro Mansueto, 21, of Floriana, was convicted of injuring Glenn Cassar, 25, of Valletta when he slashed his thigh with a penknife he extracted to defend himself from an assault. The court heard how the incident happened in the early afternoon in Triq il-Mediterran, Valletta. Cassar was driving with his brother along that stretch of road and crashed into two parked vehicles after swerving to avoid a collision with a car driven by Mansueto. The two started arguing, and Cassar was allegedly stabbed in the leg by Mansueto, who fled the site by the time police intervened. He was subsequently tracked down and arrested at home. In court, Mansueto said he had left the scene because Cassar and his brother were shouting, scaring his children who were in the car at the time. He took the children home, picked up his brother and returned to the scene to “settle the issue”. Mansueto said he was scared of the Cassars and argued that what he had done was in self-defence. However, Magistrate Leonard Caruana rubbished this argument since Mansueto had gone home and knew what to expect when he decided to return to settle things.   Mansueto told the court he brought out his penknife to scare his aggressors and did not know how he hit Cassar with the knife, which he then dumped into the sea near the Excelsior Hotel. Mansueto was found guilty of slightly injuring Cassar after a court-appointed expert classified the injury as a slash wound rather than a stab wound since the cut was not deep and no blood vessels perforated. Mansueto was also found guilty of carrying a weapon while committing a crime and possessing a knife without the necessary police licence. Magistrate Caruana placed him on probation for two years and fined him €116 for carrying an unlicensed weapon. He also issued a protection order in favour of Glenn Cassar and his brother Maverick and ordered Mansueto to pay €288 in court expenses. Police Inspector Jeffrey Scicluna prosecuted.

Title: Man avoids jail term for trafficking ecstasy
Body: A man convicted of trafficking ecstasy at a party venue more than 12 years ago has avoided an effective prison term after the Drug Offenders Rehabilitation Board was satisfied with his progress and closed his case. Jurgen Stanyer appealed a six-month jail term for trafficking ecstasy back in 2011. This week, Mr Justice Neville Camilleri suspended the jail term for one year after hearing the man’s probation officer explain how he had made drastic improvement since then. The court heard how Stanyer, who was 19 years old at the time, was one of a number of people arrested during a party at an establishment in Ta' Qali on May 1, 2011. Two police officers testified that while they were near the toilets of the entertainment venue, they noticed another young man and Stanyer exchanging cash. One officer testified that he noticed that cash changed hands after they handed something to each other. The other man was caught with a small bag of white powder suspected to be cocaine and two white pills suspected to be ecstasy. Stanyer was only caught with cash. He was eventually charged with cocaine and ecstasy trafficking but had only been found guilty of trafficking two ecstasy pills. The defence argued that if anything this was a case of trafficking by sharing since the two agreed to consume the ecstasy together. However, the court rubbished this theory. Although Stanyer said he had agreed with the other man to consume drugs together, it turned out as a fact that the two were not going to take the drug together. Defence lawyers Michael Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri asked the court to convert itself into a drugs court. The request was upheld and the case referred to the Drug Offenders Rehabilitation Board which expressed satisfaction with Stayner’s improvement in his efforts to kick the drug habit. In fact, it was closing the case. Given this development, Mr Justice Camilleri said he was upholding a recommendation by his probation officer to convert the effective jail term into a suspended one so that Stayner could continue to address his problems. However, he retained the €650 fine and ordered that the crime is not listed in the conduct certificate. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: People can now check on their partners’ domestic violence history
Body: People can now check whether their partner has a history of domestic abuse.  The service, provided by Victims Support Agency Malta, forms part of a new law – the Domestic Violence Prevention Bill- which was greenlighted by Parliament before the summer recess.  People in an intimate relationship who suspect that their partner might turn abusive or aggressive towards them can file a report with Victim Support Agency to inquire whether they have ever been found guilty of domestic violence.  The agency will only provide information on convictions.    Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri provided details about the service alongside Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg. A person can file a report by either visiting the agency's main office in Valletta, local ‘hubs’ found in various localities or filling in an online form. They will then meet with an agency official to show proof of the relationship, such as photos and messages. The person who is at risk of domestic violence can be in a cohabitation, marriage, or informal relationship. Following the meeting, the agency will go through court records to check whether there has ever been a conviction for domestic violence. While the agency will not force the inquiring person to break up, Buttigieg said it will provide psychological support if necessary.  “The fact that an individual went to the agency in the first place is a red flag in the relationship,” she said.  Camilleri said the government is doing everything it can to safeguard victims, and this new law - a first for Malta - will safeguard potential victims.  “We are being proactive by helping potential victims of domestic violence. You do not need to be a victim to reach out for help - we can prevent another crime from happening.” The Maltese law was inspired by UK legislation commonly known as Clare’s Law - named after Clare Wood, a woman murdered in the UK in 2009 by her ex.  Former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar had urged MPs to pass the law last year. The UK law gives people the right to ask for information from the police about a potential abuser, and the right for the public to know whether a person has an abusive past.  The Maltese law does not allow the police to disclose such information to the public. The law was promised as part of Labour's electoral manifesto in 2022.

Title: Cab drivers are robbed regularly, Y-plate association says
Body: Cab drivers regularly file reports complaining of thieving passengers, the Light Passenger Operators Association (LPOA) said on Wednesday. In a statement issued to the media commenting on a recent story regarding a cab driver who was robbed by passengers, the LPOA said that it is not unusual for the association to receive similar reports. “The association strongly believes this is symptomatic of a wider problem in the industry and has long been raising concerns about the lack of 24/7 emergency support for drivers,” they wrote. The association noted that only one major cab operator has round-the-clock support for drivers in case of emergencies. Drivers also do not have a dedicated support service with the national regulator, they added.  The LPOA represents drivers licenced to drive light passenger transport vehicles, commonly referred to as Y-plate vehicles.  RELATED STORIES  On Tuesday, Times of Malta reported that a cab driver lost €400 and debit cards after three passengers ran off with his backpack. Aneesh Kuyilamparambil had just finished a trip to the Safi centre when the passengers, a man and two teenagers, tried to steal his phone and backpack. During the attack, the village centre was without power, Kuyilamparambil said, as the area was among the localities affected by recent power outages. While the 40-year-old managed to wrangle his phone from one of the assailant’s hands, the two teenagers ran away with the backpack that contained €400, debit cards and documents. Three days after the robbery, he received a call from the police saying his bag was found on the street. The money was missing but Kuyilamparambil’s residence card and driving licence were there, though he had already reapplied for replacements. “While the details and nature of the case reported in the media on Tuesday remain unconfirmed by the authorities, this is far from an isolated incident,” the LPOA said on Wednesday. Given the growing nature of the industry and the risks drivers face, the association said that it is “high time” safety is given more importance.

Title: Thieves caught on camera linked to five mobile phone store thefts
Body: The police are intensifying investigations on a gang of four people who have targeted at least five mobile phone retail outlets over the past few weeks, with the latest burglary taking place early Tuesday morning. On Tuesday, Times of Malta published CCTV footage of burglars donning balaclavas, baseball hats and hoodies breaking into mobile phone retail outlets in San Ġwann, Qormi and Bay Street. In the footage, they are seen fleeing with bagfuls of mobile phones, smart watches, tablets and expensive earphones, believed to run into tens of thousands of euros. The police have now confirmed they are investigating these three burglaries and at least another two in Mrieħel and Birkirkara. Police sources said the footage from each of the shops indicates that the four burglars seem to be the same ones in every shop – they use the same modus operandi and carry the same plastic bags for the loot. The footage shows the burglars forcing open the metal shutters and then ransacking the shelves, taking all they could get their hands on in a matter of minutes. In all cases, three thieves, who seem to be male, entered the shops to clear the shelves using the torch on their mobile phones to illuminate the place. The police believe the fourth remained outside on the lookout. He could possibly be the driver of a getaway car. The first robbery took place early in the morning of July 11 when the thieves targeted the Tablets and More outlet in Triq il-Ħammieri, Qormi. They first forced open the shutter, shattered the glass door and then proceeded to ransack the shop. The police were informed about the robbery at 12.45am. Three days later, on July 14, at 1.30am, three robbers and a fourth person were filmed lifting the heavy metal shutter, forcefully entering the outlet Telecom in the busy Vjal ir-Riħan, in San Ġwann. On July 20, a lone burglar broke into Forestals on the Mrieħel bypass from where he stole mobile devices. Other technological supplies in the large shop remained untouched. The burglar only targeted the cabinet containing mobile phones. The police sources said although the robber entered the shop alone, it was not being excluded that he was part of the same gang. The burglar, wearing a baseball hat and a hoodie, arrived at the shop on foot, according to CCTV footage obtained by the police. Early on Monday morning, the four targeted the Exotique outlet at Bay Street in St Julian’s. They forced open the metal shutter, smashed glass showcases and filled plastic bags with mobile devices, worth thousands of euros. They did not steal the cash register nor any other expensive items in the shop, probably since they were caught red-handed by the complex security officer, forcing them to flee. The officer gave chase but the thieves dispersed. The theft took place at around 3.45am and they made away with mobile phone, tablets, digital cameras and expensive Apple smart watches. What is believed to be the same gang struck again just 24 hours later when the police were informed at 3.30am that a Phone Refix outlet in Birkirkara had its shutter open. When the police arrived on the scene, they found smashed glass on the ground and several mobile phones, tablets and smart watches missing from the smashed cabinets. CCTV footage from inside the shop confirmed that there were four burglars filling plastic bags with all they could fit inside them. A spokesperson for the police said that magisterial inquiries have been appointed in all cases, with court experts and scene of crime officers preserving as much evidence as they can from the shops.

Title: Cab driver robbed by passengers
Body: Three passengers robbed a cab driver last week, running away with €400 and debit cards that were in his backpack. Aneesh Kuyilamparambil had just completed an uneventful trip, driving a man and two teenagers to Safi in his cab van. But things quickly turned sour when the three passengers tried to steal his phone and backpack in the dark village centre, Kuyilamparambil said. During the attack, the Safi centre was without power, he noted. The normally quiet village was among the localities affected by a week of periodic power cuts. While the 40-year-old managed to wrangle the phone from one of the assailant’s hands, the two teenagers ran away with the backpack that contained €400, debit cards and documents. “The situation reminded me of when I used to work in Yemen,” said Kuyilamparambil, who lived in the war-torn country 10 years ago. “That country is very unsafe.” The Indian national has been living in Malta for the past two years but said he had never experienced a similar situation. Kuyilamparambil described how his three passengers, probably Maltese nationals, had been friendly and pleasant during the trip from Vittoriosa. “They were friendly and making small talk, even connecting their phone to the vehicle so they could play their music.” But as the Uber trip came to an end  and the cab driver asked the passengers to pay, the mood changed. The older assailant first said they would pay via Revolut and asked for his phone. “That didn’t make sense since they could pay me by just having my phone number,” he said. “One of the passengers started shouting. I think he was using drugs,” he continued. That was when the older assailant, who seemed to be in his early 20s, tried to snatch Kuyilamparambil’s phone. As the driver struggled with the man, the younger passengers ran away with his bag. The third assailant soon followed suit. Dumbstruck, the cab driver chased the three passengers for some 400 metres but they soon managed to outrun the cab driver. Having called the police emergency number, Kuyilamparambil was told to file a report at the Birżebbuġa police station but when he got there, a patrolling police officer directed him to Żejtun, where he filed the report. Two days later, Kuyilamparambil received a suspicious phone call from someone claiming to be from Revolut. The male voice asked for Kuyilamparambil’s debit card information, which he refused to give. Three days after the robbery, he received a call from the police saying his bag was found on the street. The money was missing but Kuyilamparambil’s residence card and driving licence were there, though he had already reapplied for replacements. He is now waiting for the police investigations to be concluded. Kuyilamparambil hopes CCTV footage in Vittoriosa, close to where he picked up the three assailants, will help the police in their work. Police confirmed investigations are ongoing. Kuyilamparambil also reported the incident to Uber. In a reply, Uber told the cab driver that they will follow up with the passenger to take the “appropriate action”. “We also made some changes in the app to reduce the chance of being paired with this rider in the future,” Uber told Kuyilamparambil. Uber told the driver to report the incident to the police and added they would do their “utmost to assist their investigation”.

Title: Sextortion on the rise among boys as young as 11: ‘We need people to report’
Body: Boys, aged 11 to 14, are being targeted by international criminal organisations and blackmailed for money after being tricked into sending naked photos of themselves to scammers posing as young, attractive women. The youngsters are asked to send their parents’ credit card details and threatened that the photos will be shared on social media if they fail to do so.  RELATED STORIES  Malta’s online abuse helpline received about 20 reports of financial sextortion of young boys over the past six months, explained Deborah Vassallo, the project coordinator of BeSmartOnline, a project that seeks to promote online safety and offers support to victims of online abuse. “Financial sextortion of young boys is increasing globally and locally. They are being targeted by criminal organisations often based in African or Asian countries. These young boys are made to believe they are chatting with a beautiful woman who sends them photos, and eventually naked ones. They are then asked to share a naked photo of themselves. The minute they do, they start blackmailing them for money. “Reporting is not easy for them. There is the guilt of sending the photos and stealing the card – if they get to that point – coupled with the shame. The solution is not sending money as, once they do, the criminals will not leave them alone,” Vassallo cautioned. Sextortion is only a part of the problem facing youths. The highest reports are cyberbullying from young people to young people. Bullying can take different forms such as through private messages, public comments using a fake account, and even fake e-mail addresses. Very often, the instigator knows the victim and is aware of personal issues. “One of the worst cases we had was of a teen whose cyberbullying was linked to his father who had just died. He was told things like: ‘I hope you lose your mother and she has a head tumour’.  There also was instigation of suicide. The child filed the report after speaking to someone at school and they sought help,” Vassallo said. The perpetrator turned out to be a quiet boy who the victim may have bullied. Another case involved a 15-year-old girl. A fake Instagram profile with her name and surname was created and photos she shared from the past were posted with comments suggesting she would do sexual things. It turned out that the perpetrators were in her group of friends and one of them was a boy she did not want to go out with. Vassallo said the majority of child abuse reports involved images or videos posted by young people themselves that would have then been leaked. There were also cases of photos posted by parents, for example of a baby during bath time with their genitals exposed.  “It’s very scary. There is a business on the dark web of photos of children being sold. We need people to report. We then work with our counterparts in other countries to stop them and save these children,” she said.   A social worker by profession, Vassallo has been part of the BeSmartOnline project since it was launched 13 years ago. It is implemented through a consortium coordinated by the Foundation for Social Welfare Services and brings together the Commissioner for Children, the Directorate for Learning and Assessment Programmes and the police’s Cyber Crime Unit. BeSmartOnline is part of a European network. The project includes Supportline 179 that focuses on internet abuse as well as the child abuse hotline www.childwebalert.gov. mt, an online reporting facility for illegal child abuse material. Over the years, the reports for both services have been on the increase. The reports received by the online abuse Supportline increased from 505 in 2020 to 691 in 2021 and 730 in 2022. So far there have been 445 reports this year.     Speaking about the child abuse hotline, Vassallo said the numbers were also on the increase. They increased from 885 in 2020, dropping to 353 in 2021 and increasing to 846 in 2022. This year 1,776 reports of illicit behaviour were received. The sharp increase this year is because a person would have reported one illegal forum that leads to multiple websites being investigated – each as individual reports, she said. Vassallo stressed that reports were anonymous as the priority was not to get to the bottom of how the person came across the illegal material but to stop the abuse. Anyone who wishes to report online abuse can contact Supportline 179 or visit besmartonline. org.mt. To report illegal child abuse material visit childwebalert.gov.mt.

Title: Cyrus Engerer appointed permanent member on Europol's scrutiny board
Body: MEP Cyrus Engerer has been appointed a permanent parliamentary member on Europol's scrutiny board. The role of the board is to continuously surveil Europol's operations and ensure that its objectives are achieved. "The cooperation between law enforcement forces of member states of the is essential and is bearing fruit," Engerer said, adding that it is important for the European agency to be continuously scrutinised, both by European countries and the European Parliament.

Title: Two accused of attempted murder after Marsascala argument
Body: Two men were remanded in custody on Thursday after pleading not guilty to attempted murder and causing grievous injuries during an argument in a Marsascala apartment two days ago. Ans Ghodban, a 27-year old Hungarian construction worker resident at San Gwann and Adnan Saed, a 30-year old Libyan former cab driver were accused of the attempted murder of an Italian man, grievously injuring him, as well as injuring another Italian man.  The arraignment was slightly delayed due to the fact that one of the accused had “mobility problems” after apparently been injured in the incident, explained the prosecutor as Saed hobbled into the courtroom, leg bandaged. Prosecuting Inspector Wayne Camilleri said that on Tuesday evening police received a report about two Italian men who appeared to have knife wounds after an argument at their Marsascala residence.  Both were conscious when police arrived on site and were able to point investigators in the direction of the suspected aggressors. One of the alleged victims immediately identified one of the aggressors as ‘Ans’ also nicknamed Ghaddafi. He had seen the other man previously but did not know his name. The second victim, when spoken to separately, also confirmed that there were two aggressors, “probably Libyans”, but he did not know them. The aggressors had fled the scene in a red Toyota Aygo, leased by Saed, who had been granted bail in separate proceedings just five days before on a very similar case, explained the prosecutor. On Wednesday, police received information which led them to the Mosta health clinic where Saed was found and immediately arrested. Ghodban was arrested inside a San Gwann block. When police knocked at the door of his apartment, he fled down a shaft and made his way into another apartment where he was soon arrested. On Thursday, both suspects were charged with attempted murder of one of the Italians, grievous bodily harm, holding their alleged victims against their will, stealing cash, and carrying a sharp and pointed weapon without a police licence. Saed was separately charged with breaching bail conditions granted on July 6. Ghodban was separately charged with failing to obey legitimate police orders and refusing to give his personal details to the police. Both were charged with relapsing. Both pleaded not guilty. There was no request for bail at arraignment stage. However, Saed’s lawyers requested the court to appoint a doctor to examine his injuries The prosecution explained that a medico-legal expert had already been appointed by the inquiring magistrate to examine both victims and the alleged aggressors. Magistrate Leonard Caruana remanded the accused in custody. AG lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted together with Inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Kurt Farrugia. Lawyers Franco Debono and Charles Mercieca were counsel to Saed. Lawyer Ishmael Psaila was counsel to Ghodban. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are appearing for the victims.

Title: Aide never confirmed or denied Dalli involvement in alleged snus scandal - Rizzo
Body: An aide of former European Commissioner John Dalli never confirmed or denied to the police that Dalli was involved in a multimillion-euro attempted bribe to lift an EU ban on smokeless tobacco, former police commissioner John Rizzo told a court on Wednesday. He would never give a yes or a no, Rizzo said with reference to police questioning of the late Silvio Zammit, who was Dalli's aide for several years. Rizzo was testifying in proceedings against Dalli who is pleading not guilty to trading in influence concerning an alleged €60 million bribe that Zammit had allegedly solicited to help lift the EU-wide ban on snus. Rizzo said he had questioned Zammit and repeatedly asked him to “spare” Dalli from the tangle if he knew that he had nothing to do with the matter. But Zammit never said that Dalli was involved nor that he was not, insisting in his police statements that he had named “all those who were somehow involved.” That included Dalli. Rizzo gave a detailed timeline of police investigations while he was police commissioner. He said it had all started in October 2012 when he was asked by the Attorney General to handle investigations into a case forwarded by OLAF (the EU anti-fraud body) concerning alleged bribery by a number of individuals. Dalli’s name cropped up. Despite the OLAF investigation, the Malta police started afresh, speaking to all those involved including John Dalli, Zammit, lawyer Gayle Kimberley, who was a lawyer and former lobbyist for tobacco company Swedish Match, other representatives of that company and OLAF investigators. Evidence indicated that it all started from a 2010 meeting which [Tomas] Hammargren, chairman of ESTOC (the European Smokeless Tobacco lobby) had requested with Dalli. That meeting was arranged by Zammit and was held at the Kempinski Hotel in Gozo where Dalli was on vacation. It was an “informal but organized meeting” of the kind that was not supposed to take place, said Rizzo, explaining that then EU Commission President Barroso had issued instructions that any meetings by commissioners were to be conducted through proper channels. Dalli later told police that he did not know who he was speaking to during that meeting. But Zammit gave a totally different view, saying that he had prepared Dalli for that meeting. “Everyone knew who he was talking to and even business cards were exchanged,” Rizzo continued. His testimony was interrupted by defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell who pointed out that not only was Zammit an inadmissible witness, in view of criminal charges in his regard, but he was now dead and could not be cross-examined. “Rizzo is saying that he believed Zammit but elsewhere he did not and, rather, pressed charges against him. Zammit died while still awaiting the outcome of those proceedings,” remarked the lawyer. Presiding Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo directed the witness to limit himself to what he personally attested in the investigations. Rizzo said that during the meeting in Gozo, questions were asked about smokeless tobacco. Later, Zammit and a third party travelled to Stockholm where he met Inge Del Fosse who had succeeded Hammargren. Over lunch, Zammit bragged about his “friendship” with the Dalli and even tried to impress his table companions by trying to call Dalli. “But it appears that he did not succeed,” said Rizzo. Calls between Dalli, Zammit and Kimberley as well as Gaming Authority official, Iosif Galea, who was another friend of Zammit, followed practically every meeting and the call logs were there “black on white.” Following that lunch meeting in Stockholm, Zammit emailed Del Fosse saying that he had handed material on smokeless tobacco to Dalli, who was “today better informed on the subject.” That was when Swedish Match entered the scene. They contacted Kimberley, offering her a €5000 consultancy with the main aim being to set up contact with Dalli. Through her acquaintance, she was introduced to Zammit who, in turn, proved to be the link to Dalli. A meeting was held at Dalli’s Portomaso offices in January 2012, Rizzo said. Kimberley exited that meeting “satisfied,” describing it as a very cordial encounter with Dalli who, though against smokeless tobacco, was ready to listen to scientific evidence. “If anyone could amend the law it was Dalli,” Kimberley had remarked. However, a second meeting scheduled with Dalli was first rescheduled and then cancelled at the eleventh hour, with Zammit informing Kimberley that Dalli did not wish to speak to her personally any further. She was to forward any communication to him in writing via Zammit. That was when Kimberley formulated five questions in a note titled “Meeting with the (European) Commissioner.” Zammit called her and set up a meeting at his own Peppi’s Kiosk in Sliema in February. There he handed her Dalli's answers to her queries, all written in Zammit’s own handwriting but too technical to be attributed to him. Every proposal to lift the ban on smokeless tobacco was to be made “against a price,” Zammit had said, mentioning a “six zero figure.” Kimberley reported back to her boss at Swedish Match but was “too embarrassed” to tell him that Dalli had not met her. That was when Johan Gabrielsson, her superior at the Swedish company, travelled to Malta for a meeting with Zammit who elaborated on the asking price dropping the “€60 million” sum. A few days later, Gabrielsson told Kimberly to stop communicating with Zammit. Rizzo said that Zammit had also contacted Del Fosse offering to carry out consultancy work for ESTOC, also setting up meetings with Dalli. That interested Del Fosse. But Zammit next told her that a meeting could be organized “at a price.” When she questioned that, Zammit hung up, saying that he would “get back.” When he did, it was to tell her that his “boss" was ready to meet with [her] boss anywhere in the world…..but at a price of 10 million. In his conversations, Zammit referred to Dalli as his “boss,” or “John” or “Dalli” or “the Commissioner,” said Rizzo, saying that his evidence was also backed by recorded calls and transcripts. Del Fosse referred to her superiors who stopped her from further communication with Zammit. When questioned by OLAF, Dalli “categorically denied’ knowledge of any investigation. But it transpired that his “very close friend” Zammit had immediately called him to let him know that he had been interrogated by OLAF. When taking that call, Dalli had been dining with Barroso in Cyprus. Yet he did not mention anything. “He should have if he wished to prove his innocence,” said Rizzo. When Dalli himself was questioned, discrepancies emerged between his statements to OLAF and those to the police in Malta. He had told OLAF that he absolutely did not know about the investigation but admitted to police that Zammit had informed him. He had also tried to downplay the importance of that meeting at the Kempinski, saying that he did not know who he was speaking to but later admitting that business cards were exchanged. Dalli also threatened to take legal action against the person who had implicated him in all this. Yet to date, only a legal letter had materialised. Moreover, he and Zammit had subsequently exchanged calls and met at a meeting with “Mr Refalo.” Asked by Tonna Lowell whether police had been informed of Dalli's [diplomatic] immunity, Rizzo said that the AG was constantly updated but had never drawn their attention to that. Investigators appeared to have based themselves mainly on statements obtained through interrogation. “Dalli had lied to OLAF when he said that he did not know about the investigation,” said Rizzo. Tonna Lowell promptly rebutted that claim, saying that Zammit at no point had told police that Dalli was involved. But Rizzo clarified that although he had repeatedly asked Zammit to spare Dalli if he knew that he was not involved, Zammit never said Dalli was or was not. Rather he insisted that he had mentioned “all those involved.” The case continues. AG Lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici prosecuted. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Stephen Tonna Lowell were defence counsel.

Title: Three canvas prints 'neatly' stolen from Malta Fashion Week display
Body: Three canvas prints used for Malta Fashion Week events outside the Hotel Phoenicia were "neatly" torn out from their display frames and stolen overnight. Two of the prints were by Lorella Castillo and the other by Darrin Zammit Lupi. Adrian J. Mizzi, executive producer and founder of Malta Fashion Week, said the prints were neatly cut from their displays as if to preserve their quality. “There is no evidence of vindictiveness. Had that been the case, whoever did this would have torn the images. They did it because they wanted them.” he said. The photos were from last year's Fashion Week and from the photographers' personal collections, Mizzi said. A police report has been filed.   Mizzi said the theft must have happened between midnight and 6.30am as he had seen the displays at around midnight.  He said somebody may have seen the people involved. The prints were bulky - two by nine metres - and they were not easy to hold, let alone hide. The organisers had been planning to keep them after the event to allow for the possibility of using them next year. “This person decided that since Fashion Week had ended, it was his right to take the photos. Disgraceful,”  Mizzi said.    The Fashion Week organisers also expressed their disappointment in a Facebook post. “Yes we totally get that they are nice photos but anyone wishing to exhibit large print images of this kind should reach out to the photographers in question to purchase,” they wrote. In her own social media post, Castillo expressed her own disappointment. “Thank you for liking them so much, but stealing art is just a criminal and insanely disgusting act,” she wrote, emphasising that those responsible should be “ashamed”. Zammit Lupi described whoever stole his work as a 'lowlife'. A police spokesperson confirmed that a report has been filed and investigations are underway.

Title: Eight organisations slam 'hate speech' after Dancing with Pride event
Body: Eight organisations have issued a joint statement condemning “the degrading comments and the resulting hate speech” on social media following the official EuroPride 2023 dance in Valletta on Saturday. It came after some people questioned the inclusion of children in the Dancing with Pride event held in the run-up to EuroPride, which will be held in Valletta in September. PN MP Justin Schembri had asked if it was appropriate for children to be involved. "I have always argued, let children be children," he said. "This goes against this argument."   Veteran television personality John Bundy also shared his concerns in a now-deleted post, saying he supported the celebration of rights but that organisers should "leave the children out of it".    However ADITUS, ADPD - Malta’s Green Party, Allied Rainbow Communities, Drachma LGBTI, Drachma Parents , Equality Labour (Partit Laburista), LGBTI + Gozo, and MGRM - The Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement hit back in a joint statement.  "We request maturity and responsibility from persons with a wide-reaching audience who unfortunately choose to use their public platform to promote discrimination and prejudice against the LGBTIQ+ community”.  They said they were referring to “derogatory comments” implying that the LGBTIQ+ community “should hide itself from certain categories of society”. The organisations said “this attitude ignores the realities of LGBTIQ+ people and their families who form part of and contribute to society.   “Such a reaction is a reminder of why the need for Pride persists, and that despite the legal achievements, much work is left to be done to educate and change mentalities in the Maltese Islands.” In their statement, the organisations said Dancing with Pride was an event designed with everyone in mind, an all-ages-appropriate celebration championing diversity and people coming together from the LGBTIQ community, their families, and allies. “It intended to continue pushing Malta and Gozo further in favour of the pillars of democracy. As diverse as society is on our islands, we should be encouraging inclusion and understanding with people of all ages and backgrounds, not closing off in a bubble ignoring the diverse realities that surround us.” They said it is disappointing that, despite the introduction of revolutionary reforms in Malta, some public figures, including politicians and people working in the media, still insist on judging families who voluntarily join a music and dance event, simply because the organisers are members of the LGBTIQ+ community. They added that, as NGOs and members of the Malta LGBTIQ Consultative Council, “we will keep on promoting the message that there is space for everyone in a society where love and social justice prevail. We will continue to ensure that no one is left behind.”  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Man in tears as recalls alleged sex assault by star Kevin Spacey
Body: An aspiring actor broke down as he recounted how Hollywood star Kevin Spacey performed a sex act on him, a UK jury heard Monday. The award-winning actor, 63, is on trial in London accused of a string of sexual offences against four men dating back more than 20 years. The fourth of Spacey’s alleged victims, none of whom can be named for legal reasons, said he had been warned that the star liked “young straight men”. But he said he did not know at that point that he was a “predator”. The prosecution in the case alleges that Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, was a “sexual bully” who delighted in making others uncomfortable. Three other men have recounted how the star groped them repeatedly, even when they asked him to stop. In a police interview played to the court, the fourth complainant said he was left in tears when he rejected the star’s advances at the actor’s flat. ‘Incredibly weird’ He told a police officer he had not left when Spacey had put his head in his crotch because of the actor’s reputation and status. “You just don’t want to annoy someone who’s that powerful in the business you’re trying to break into,” he said. “The social sway he had was massive,” he added, stressing that nothing that happened was consensual. The pair met up after the complainant wrote a letter to him asking for help, and was surprised when he invited him for a beer. They shared pizza and smoked cannabis together before Spacey made advances, which he described as “incredibly weird” and left him nervous.  RELATED STORIES  He recalled how he fell asleep, only to wake up about four or five hours later with his zip undone and Spacey performing a sex act. When he said “no”, Spacey stopped and asked him to leave, he added. “He said I shouldn’t talk to anyone about what had happened,” he told the officer. Spacey, an Academy Award winner for The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, was artistic director of London’s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015. He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The offences are said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013. Spacey’s lawyer said some of what the jury will hear has been “deliberately exaggerated” or “damned lies”, suggesting the complainants were motivated by money.

Title: Witnesses describe violent arguments before young mother was murdered
Body: Updated with details 7.48pm - A man accused of murdering his partner, Maria Lourdes Agius is facing trial by jury after another panel of jurors dismissed his insanity plea four years ago. Michael Emmanuel, a 33-year old Ivorian national, stands accused of murdering the 35-year old mother-of-seven in her Paola home.  Her body was found by police in her bedroom after Emmanuel had turned up at the local police station early on 15 September 2018 saying that the woman could not be roused from her sleep. Police investigators later testified that under interrogation, Emmanuel said that on the night of the murder, Agius had told him that he was not the father of her youngest child.    The victim’s mother, who used to live with the couple, later described a deteriorating relationship and various violent episodes between her daughter and Emmanuel. Emmanuel was subsequently charged with wilful homicide. In July 2019, his lawyers argued that he was legally insane at the time of the crime. A psychiatrist who examined him had testified that he had some delusions of grandeur and appeared paranoid about his partner.  He appeared to be suffering from “acute psychosis,” the psychiatrist concluded. However, the jury had thrown out that plea of legal insanity.  As the trial, presided by Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja., got underway, a police inspector testified how Maria Lourdes Agius’s lifeless body was found lying on her right-hand side facing the bedroom wall, her left hand covering her face and neck, hiding the injuries which were discovered later. Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa said that she was on duty on the morning of September 15, five years ago at Paola police station. Around 7am Michael Emmanuel reported that he had tried to wake up his partner but she was not responding. A police sergeant had gone to the couple’s apartment where the victim’s mother informed him that Maria Lourdes was still sleeping “because of the fight” she and her daughter had had with the accused two days before. The woman then led the officer to the bedroom where she tried to wake up her daughter. But Maria Lourdes did not respond. The mother began to yell at the accused, saying that he had killed her daughter because of their previous row. Soon after, Inspector Zerafa said she arrived at the scene of the suspicious death. Describing the layout of the bedroom, she said there was a wardrobe and a baby’s cot on the right-hand side and a double bed opposite, where the victim’s lifeless body lay, covered by a sheet, her left arm raised over her face and neck. “She was clearly placed in that position to conceal the injuries,” said the witness. A medico-legal expert later moved the victim’s body, revealing the scratches around her mouth and suspected strangulation marks on her neck. Emmanuel became the prime suspect in the murder. He subsequently signed a declaration refusing the right to be assisted by a lawyer. When asked about that night, the suspect he recalled that he had bought a pizza but Agius did not eat. He claimed that they later went to bed but the next morning, she did not wake up. All throughout the interrogation Emmanuel appeared calm and willingly answered all questions except those concerning that last night, answering those questions with a “no” or “I don’t know.” Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace, the inspector said that when communicating with the accused “some words were not clear” but police told him to repeat. “He understood our questions and we understood his answers.” The inspector said Emmanuel bore no visible injuries but told police that his hand was hurting because of the argument he had had two days before. In his second statement, Emmanuel allegedly mentioned a cross. A small wooden cross, slightly smaller than the palm of a hand, was shown to the jurors in evidence. That cross had been seized by the police after the accused allegedly indicated its exact location in the couple’s flat. The officer could not recall exactly where he had found the item but said that he thought it was in the bedroom. A former police sergeant stationed at Paola testified that at the time of the alleged murder, he had handled investigations into the violent argument between “a dark skinned male and two women” at the Paola residence two days before Agius was found dead. male was Emmanuel and the two women were Agius and her mother.  On that occasion the accused had turned up at the police station with three small children, telling officers that he was willing to tell the police everything as long as they provided assistance for the kids. He did not want the children to stay with the mother any longer. That day an argument between the couple had escalated when Maria Lourdes’ mother allegedly threatened “to wipe the floor” with Emmanuel and then threw the youngest child onto a bed. Later both the victim and her mother claimed that Micheal Emmanuel had punched them. He denied it, insisting that they had thrown items at each other during the heated row. The situation between the parties had somewhat re-ignited when they met at the police station while a temporary solution was being sought for the children. But matters calmed down again and the accused, as the biological father of two of the children, agreed that it was best if they stayed with the mother since he did not have a fixed residence at the time. However he was ordered by police not to approach his partner nor her mother and their home. The trial continues. AG lawyers Anthony Vella and Maria Francesca Spiteri are prosecuting.

Title: Anti-money laundering fines reach €2.2million so far this year
Body: A total of €2.2 million worth of fines were imposed by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit during the first half of 2023, statistics tabled in parliament show. The anti-money laundering unit is facing a challenge to its powers after a constitutional court in March declared that the fines it imposes are unconstitutional. Judge Audrey Demicoli ruled that the FIAU does not classify as a court so its power to impose administrative penalties is unconstitutional and in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights. The FIAU is subject to 17 court cases alleging breaches of constitutional rights, according to data provided to parliament by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana in May. Other statistics tabled in parliament this month by Caruana show the FIAU continued to impose fines after the March decision. Around €780,000 worth of fines were issued by the FIAU between April and June. Last year, the unit issued €3.1 million in fines to companies and individuals found to be in breach of anti-money laundering laws. According to the laws regulating the FIAU, the unit may impose administrative penalties not exceeding €5 million.   The FIAU ramped up its supervision of the financial sector in response to Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Former FATF president Marcus Pleyer last year warned against Malta “deprioritising” the fight against financial crime. In an interview with Times of Malta, Pleyer said he has seen this happen in “many countries” after an FATF evaluation. He said that after FATF’s evaluations, he has often seen countries divert resources away from key authorities needed to fight money laundering and terrorism financing. “My advice is to seize the opportunity to continue reforms after the grey-listing,” he said. “The process made Malta a much better place when it comes to fighting money laundering. People in key authorities have a much better understanding of the risks, and have better structures in place to detect, investigate and disrupt illicit financial flows,” Pleyer said.

Title: UK police seize more than 700 guns in European swoop
Body: More than 700 firearms have been seized and 74 people arrested in Britain after a massive European operation targeting blank pistols, the UK's National Crime Agency said Sunday.  The arrests and seizures are part of an international investigation launched five years ago involving Spain's Guardia Civil police force, Europol and authorities in other European countries, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement.  The operation targeted alarm or blank pistols which can be modified to become lethal weapons.   "Each of these 700 firearms had the potential to fall into the wrong hands and be used by criminals to further their offending or, at worst, take a life," said Charles Yates, deputy director of the National Crime Agency.  While these blank weapons are authorised in several European countries, it is forbidden to import and possess them in Britain.  "Criminals like the guns because they are cheap, resemble firearms such as Glocks so can be used to intimidate or threaten others, and they can be converted into lethal weapons," the NCA said.  The majority of the weapons seized were intercepted at Britain's borders, before they could be used, he added.  The Spanish Guardia Civil police force had identified suspicious purchases of blank-firing weapons by foreigners before tracking them down and intercepting them.

Title: After riots, France bans July 14 fireworks sales
Body: France has banned the sale, possession and transport of fireworks during the July 14 national holiday weekend, following riots sparked by the police killing a teenager, the government said Sunday. Fireworks were among the weapons of choice during the unrest that exploded in France after a police officer shot dead a 17-year-old during a traffic stop on June 27 near Paris, rekindling long pent-up frustrations and accusations of systemic racism among France's security forces. "In order to prevent the risk of serious disturbances to public order during the July 14 festivities, the sale, possession, transport and use of pyrotechnical articles and fireworks is banned until July 15 inclusively," said a government decree published in the official Journal on Sunday. The ban does not extend to professionals or municipalities that are organising traditional fireworks for the Bastille Day celebrations, it added. Worried about a possible resurgence of rioting, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told the daily Le Parisien on Saturday that the government would deploy "massive means to protect the French" during the national holiday. Fireworks displays are an annual feature of Bastille Day celebrations. They are also often used during protests in the country. The police killing in the Paris suburb of Nanterre of Nahel M., who had Algerian roots, sparked France's worst urban violence since 2005. More than 3,700 people were taken into police custody in connection with the protests since Nahel's death, including at least 1,160 minors, according to official figures.

Title: France protesters defy bans to rally against police violence
Body: Around 2,000 people defied a ban to join a memorial rally in central Paris Saturday for a young black man who died in police custody, while marches took place throughout France to denounce police brutality, as tensions run high after days of rioting engulfed the country. Nationwide, around 5,900 people took to the streets, according to the interior ministry. Seven years after the death of Adama Traore, his sister had planned to lead an annual commemorative march north of Paris in Persan and Beaumont-sur-Oise.   But fearful of reigniting recent unrest sparked by the police killing of 17-year-old Nahel M. at a traffic stop near Paris, a court ruled the chance of public disturbance was too high to allow the march to proceed. In a video posted on Twitter, Assa Traore, Adama's older sister, denounced the decision. "The government has decided to add fuel to the fire" and "not to respect the death of my little brother", she said. She instead attended a rally in central Paris's Place de la Republique to tell "the whole world that our dead have the right to exist, even in death". "We are marching for the youth to denounce police violence. They want to hide our deaths," she said at the rally, also attended by several lawmakers.  "They authorise marches by neo-Nazis but they don't allow us to march. France cannot give us moral lessons. Its police is racist and violent," she said. The Paris rally had also been banned on the grounds that it could disrupt public order and a legal case has been opened against Assa Traore for organising the event, police said.  Youssouf Traore, another of Assa Tarore's brothers, was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of violence against a person holding public authority, public prosecutors told AFP. "The march went off peacefully, it was a success, we don't understand his arrest," Assa Traore said.  Jean-Luc Melenchon, the outspoken head of the radical leftist France Unbowed party, castigated the government on Twitter. "From prohibition to repression... the leader is taking France to a regime we have already seen. Danger. Danger," he tweeted, referring to the World War II regime of Vichy leader Philippe Petain who collaborated with the Nazis. Many at the rally shouted "Justice for Nahel" before calmly dispersing later in the afternoon. Around 30 demonstrations against police violence also took place across France, including in the southern port city of Marseille and in Strasbourg in the east. Authorities in Lille banned a gathering. Several trade unions, political parties and associations had called on supporters to join the march for Traore as France reels from allegations of institutionalised racism in its police ranks following Nahel M.'s shooting. Traore, who was 24 years old, died shortly after his arrest in 2016, sparking several nights of unrest that played out similarly to the week-long rioting that erupted across the country in the wake of the point-blank shooting of Nahel.  The teenager's death on June 27 rekindled long-standing accusations of systemic racism among security forces, and a UN committee urged France to ban racial profiling.  The foreign ministry on Saturday disputed what it called "excessive" and "unfounded" remarks by the panel. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) - 18 independent experts - on Friday asked France to pass legislation defining and banning racial profiling and questioned "excessive use of force by law enforcement". "Any ethnic profiling by law enforcement is banned in France," the ministry responded, adding that "the struggle against excesses in racial profiling has intensified". Far-right parties have linked the most intense and widespread riots France has seen since 2005 to mass migration and have demanded curbs on new arrivals. More than 3,700 people have been taken into police custody in connection with the protests since Nahel's death, including at least 1,160 minors, according to official figures.

Title: From the Bench: What is considered to be self-defence?
Body: In simple terms, self-defence is when an individual protects himself by using force against someone who is attacking him. Self-defence is a plea which can be raised by anyone charged before the criminal courts for homicide or bodily harm, and is regulated by the Criminal Code, Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta. The key provisions of self-defence in the Criminal Code are found under Title VIII, Of Crimes against the Person, Sub-title III, Of Justifiable Homicide or Bodily Harm. Article 223 provides that no offence is committed when a homicide or a bodily harm is ordered or permitted by law or by a lawful authority or is necessary for an individual to defend himself or another person. Article 224 of the Maltese Criminal Code further provides that actual necessity of lawful defence includes when the aggressor is killed or injured: (a) in the act of repelling at nighttime between the hours of sunset and sunrise. (b) upon entering an inhabited house, apartment or a connected building either by scaling walls or breaking in. (c) upon committing or attempting to commit theft aggravated with violence. (d) as a defence from one’s own chastity or that of another person. The plea of self-defence was the subject matter of an appeal filed before the Criminal Court of Appeal presided by Madam Justice Edwina Grima on the 31 May 2023 in the name Police vs Desislava Vasileva Maksimova. In her appeal, the appellant Maksimova requested the court to vary a judgement delivered by the Court of Magistrate as a Court of Criminal Judicature wherein she was found guilty of having grievously injured her partner. She was sentenced to two years imprisonment. In her appeal, Maksimova claimed that she was wrongly convicted since she acted in self-defence. The Criminal Court of Appeal prior to delivering its judgement, observed that there are three elements at law that are doctrinally required for the crime of homicide and bodily harm to be legally justifiable. 1) The offender must commit a serious threat or aggression; 2) The unprovoked and inevitable offence threatens imminent injury or death, and 3) That the reaction must be proportionate to the threat or aggression. Hence, what the defence had to prove, was that the danger faced by the appellant during the incident was unjust, grave and inevitable and that the response to the danger faced by the appellant was objectively proportionate to the extent of the aggression. The court referred to notes by Sir Anthony Mamo, further adding that: “The accused must prove that the act was done by him to avoid an evil which could not otherwise be avoided." In other words, the danger must be sudden, actual, and absolute. If the danger was expected with certainty, one would not have been justified to rashly brave such danger and place himself in a situation of having either to suffer death or grievous injury or to inflict it. In the second place, the danger must be actual: if it had already passed, it may, at best, amount to provocation or, at worst, to cold-blooded revenge, and not to legitimate defence. Thirdly, the danger threatened must be absolute and could not be averted by other means. The court commented further that the ratio legis (the reason or purpose behind making a law) behind the plea of legitimate defence to justify a killing or body harm, was when a person found himself in a serious situation and was unable to resort to other means of escape or to avoid the danger, thus being forced to resort to protect himself or any other person from the actual, serious and unavoidable danger. If it resulted that the person had other choices at the moment of the incident which he could have adopted, then the justification of self-defence would be missing. Furthermore, in those situations where it resulted to the court that the force exercised by the person defending himself was not proportionate to that received by the aggressor, the crime could be excusable on the grounds of the exercise of excessive self-defence as regulated in article 230(d) and 227(d) of the Criminal Code. Article 227(d) of Chapter 9 of the laws of Malta provides that wilful homicide is to be considered as excusable “where it is committed by any person who, acting under the circumstances mentioned in article 223, shall have exceeded the limits imposed by law, by the authority or by necessity.” Article 230(d)  further provides that “the crime of wilful bodily harm shall be excusable in the cases mentioned as excuses for wilful homicide in article 227(d).” The court in this case after having examined all the evidence and the arguments brought forward by both parties, was in a position to conclude, that the appellant actions could not be justified under articles 223 and 224 of the Criminal Code, nevertheless her action could be considered as excusable in terms of article 230(d) and 227(d). Hence, the court opted to change the punishment given by the Court of Magistrate as a Court of Criminal Judicature and instead of two years imprisonment, the appellant was sentenced to eight months imprisonment suspended for one year.

Title: Fact-check: GP claims that 'rape victims don't get pregnant'
Body: Claim: Rape victims don't get pregnant. Only 3 in 100,000 women worldwide become pregnant as a result of rape. Verdict: This claim is false. Experts agree that rape incidents are drastically underreported and that true rape figures are much higher than official data shows. Using these figures to estimate the number of women who become pregnant through rape is misleading, as the true number is likely to be higher. In a comment posted on the Times of Malta website beneath an article about the recently-introduced abortion bill, local doctor Jean Karl Soler said that “rape victims don’t get pregnant”, going on to describe the risk of pregnancy following rape as “vanishingly low”. Soler was replying to a comment submitted by another reader who criticised the bill for ignoring the needs of rape victims whose rape results in pregnancy. In his comment, Soler said, "rape victims don't get pregnant (sorry, facts are facts; based on CDC statistics such is extremely unlikely)".  The original comment posted by Soler beneath a Times of Malta article.   Soler rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, when his criticism of the government's handling of pandemic measures earned him a significant following on social media. Screenshots of his comments about rape were shared extensively on Facebook, most prominently by incensed pro-choice activists. Soler, in turn, took to Facebook to explain that the global rape risk is just 13.9 per 100,000 women. Of these, Soler said, only 5% are likely to result in pregnancy, meaning that in practice only three in 100,000 women face the risk of pregnancy resulting from rape.   The belief that rape cannot, or is unlikely to, result in pregnancy has often raised its head in abortion debates around the world. Versions of this claim have been traced back as far as 13th-century legal texts, but they have stuck around and are used to this day, with several US lawmakers, in particular, downplaying the risk of pregnancy as a result of rape. Several readers asked Times of Malta to verify the true extent of pregnancy resulting from rape. Only if we take rape statistics at face value. Rape statistics are notoriously unreliable for several reasons, the most evident being the well-documented under-reporting of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Some reports say that 60% of rape incidents go unreported, while others estimate the figure to be closer to two-thirds of all victims. Other studies believe this to be far higher. UK official statistics from 2020 estimate that five out of every six women who are raped never file a police report. Meanwhile, research in Pakistan found that only 0.2% of rape victims report the crime, despite a woman being raped every two hours. Whatever the true figure, experts agree that reported rapes are only the tip of the iceberg. Even the source used by Soler, a US-based website called Wisevoter, makes the same argument, pointing out that “rape is an incredibly under-reported crime, meaning that many victims do not come forward to report due to fear of stigma or retribution”. The 10 countries with the lowest rate of rape in the world according to Wisevoter’s data lists several countries with notoriously poor human rights records. Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Azerbaijan all feature in the top five, with Syria, Nigeria and Tajikistan right below them. In presenting its data, Wisevoter warns readers that a low rate of rape “does not mean that rape incidents rarely happen in those countries, but rather that such incidents are not being reported”.   Even if rape reporting were more reliable, global rape statistics would still be problematic for several other reasons, not least the fact that what is legally defined as rape often varies across countries and cultures. For instance, several countries around the world either do not recognise marital rape or explicitly exclude it from anti-rape legislation. Similarly, some countries only recognise rape in cases of penetrative intercourse, while others include other forms of sexual violence. Likewise, stealthing – the act of removing a condom without the partner’s consent – is classified as rape in some countries, but not in several others. These differences make it very difficult to develop consistent or reliable data around the issue. While we may never know the true extent of rape around the world, what we certainly do know is that the true figure is much higher than the actual number of rapes reported. There is relatively little research into rape in Malta and accurate data about the prevalence of rape is hard to come by. Malta’s criminal code defines rape as “non-consensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration”. The law also prohibits marital rape, listing it as an aggravating circumstance that results in a harsher punishment for perpetrators. Police data shows that there were 287 female victims of rape since 2008, with 37 cases reported last year alone, the highest annual figure recorded. As in other countries around the world, rape is believed to be dramatically under-reported in Malta. A crime victimisation survey carried out in 2015 by several leading local criminologists found that almost 86% of people who were victims of sexual assault, including rape, did not report the crime to the police.  The criminologists say that this is "understandable since most victims know their perpetrator" and may fear that reporting the crime could lead to further repercussions. Soler argues that around 5% of rapes are likely to result in pregnancy, saying that several sources present similar statistics when analysing the rate of rape-related pregnancy. Soler is partly correct, although statistics on rape and pregnancy tend to vary wildly. The most widely-recognised study in the field, a 1996 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, examined a sample of 4,000 women and found that there was a 5% chance of pregnancy after being raped. The study included cases of rape in which condoms were used. Half the women in the study opted to undergo an abortion, while a third chose to see the pregnancy to full term and keep the infant. The study concludes that “rape-related pregnancy occurs with significant frequency. It is a cause of many unwanted pregnancies and is closely linked with family and domestic violence”. The US Centre for Disease Control estimates the true figure to be higher, saying that of the 18 million women who have experienced vaginal rape in their lifetime, almost three million experience rape-related pregnancy, a rate of roughly 16%. A 1998 study into cases of rape amongst high school students in Ethiopia reached a similar conclusion, finding that 17% of rapes resulted in pregnancy, although this study is based on a relatively small sample. No, the flawed and disputed data on the topic makes it almost impossible to reach a reliable estimate. An analysis by Politifact attempted to figure out the number of rape-related pregnancies in the US, following a claim by a US senator that 25,000 American women become pregnant through rape or incest each year. Politifact assumed a 5% risk of pregnancy, in line with the 1996 study, calculating that anywhere between 3,200 and 50,000 women in the US become pregnant each year through rape. The analysis concludes that “there is too much disagreement for us to pin any one statistic as the definitive number of rape-related pregnancies per year”. If we apply a similar 5% risk of pregnancy to the number of reported rapes in Malta over the past decade, this would mean that roughly 14 women became pregnant through rape since 2008. In any case, this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Given the finding that 86% of sexual assault victims do not report their assault, it is likely that the true figure is far higher. Discussions about rape and abortion frequently involve other claims, different from those made by Soler, that the trauma and stress caused by being raped can somehow prevent pregnancy. In 2012, prospective US senator Todd Akin famously claimed that in cases of what he termed "legitimate rape", a woman's body has the ability to "shut that whole thing down". Akin later acknowledged that he was wrong.  Similar theories had been espoused before. One Republican senator in the 1980s had claimed that "when that traumatic experience is undergone, a woman secretes a certain secretion which has a tendency to kill the sperm". Similarly, US obstetrician and anti-abortion activist John Willke once said that the trauma of rape "can radically upset (a woman's) possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy". Willke's comments were later rubbished by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who said that the claim “contradicts basic biological truths”. Experts say that science does not support any of these claims, arguing that while chronic stress may decrease fertility, acute stress does not have a similar impact. More broadly, studies show that consensual and non-consensual intercourse are both equally likely to result in pregnancy. In written comments to Times of Malta, Soler said that his initial assertion that "rape victims do not get pregnant" was a "generalisation" that he later clarified in a Facebook post. Soler defended his use of a rape rate of 13.9 per 100,000, saying that it "is not only a maximum figure, but it is also quite consistently reported by numerous sources". He also reiterated that 5% of this figure "is clearly a very small number, and thus the generalisation that such is not the rule but the exception, is clearly demonstrated. In science, a proportion of less than 5% is considered spurious, in defining a generalisation as statistically significant".  Soler admitted that it is "reasonable" to believe that the incidence of rape is higher than reported, however, argued that this would only mean that the rate of rapes resulting in pregnancy is even lower than he claimed. There is a broad consensus that cases of rape are drastically under-reported and that rape statistics do not paint a realistic picture of the incidence of rape. While the most widely-cited study found that 5% of rapes result in pregnancy, this figure has been disputed and there is no definitive consensus over what the true figure may be. Studies broadly show that the rate of pregnancy in cases of rape is the same as that of consensual intercourse. Attempts to estimate the number of rape-related pregnancies have concluded that the data is too flawed to reach a realistic or accurate conclusion. It is incorrect to say that only three in 100,000 women become pregnant as a result of rape as this estimate is based on data that experts agree is not realistic. This claim is therefore false, as the evidence clearly refutes the claim.

Title: UN committee demands France fully probe police killing of Nahel
Body: A UN committee on Friday called on France to ensure the investigation into the killing of Nahel, the teenager shot dead by police near Paris, is "thorough and impartial", and called for racial profiling to be banned. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), made up of 18 independent experts, flagged concerns on racial profiling and the excessive use of force by law enforcement".  The experts also condemned "looting and destruction of private and public property as well as reports of mass arrests and detention of protesters". The UN committee said it welcomed the opening of an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the killing of Nahel, whose death sparked an eruption of violence in France.  "France (should) promptly ensure that the investigation into the circumstances that led to the death of Nahel M. is thorough and impartial... prosecute the alleged perpetrators and, if convicted, to sanction them" accordingly, it said. It also called for France to "adopt legislation that defines and prohibits racial profiling". It reiterated its recommendation that the authorities address as a priority "structural and systemic causes of racial discrimination including in law enforcement". Its intervention came as a French administrative court heard an appeal against a decision by authorities to ban a march in memory of Nahel organised by the Adama Traore foundation. Traore, who was black, died in police custody in 2016 sparking several nights of rioting. The decision on the ban was due to be handed down later Friday. The UN committee - which monitors the application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination - flagged concerns around the Nahel case under its early warning and urgent action procedure.  It said it was deeply concerned by "the continuing practice of racial profiling combined with the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular the police, against members of minority groups, particularly people of African and Arab descent."

Title: Hundreds charged after vast UK cannabis operation
Body: More than 450 people were charged and cannabis plants worth more than £115 million (€135 million) seized in a massive month-long drugs operation in June, British police said Friday. Operation Mille saw searches and arrests carried out across England and Wales "at a scale and pace not seen before", police said. "Nearly 200,000 cannabis plants with an estimated street value of between £115-£130 million (€135 million-€152 million) were seized," police said. Around 1,000 people were arrested and of those "more than 450 were later charged". Cannabis production is a cash cow for organised crime, investigators say, fuelling gang violence as groups compete for territory. "Organised networks involved in cannabis production are also directly linked to an array of other serious criminality such as class A drug importation, modern slavery and wider violence and exploitation," said Steve Jupp, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for serious organised crime. "This operation not only successfully disrupted a significant amount of criminal activity, but the intelligence gathered will also help inform future law enforcement activity across the country." Officers also seized 20 firearms and 26 kilos of cocaine with a potential street value of £1 million. Crimes linked to gangland feuds have shocked the nation in recent years. In April a gunman was jailed for more than 40 years for a shooting that claimed the life of a nine-year-old girl in Liverpool in northwest England.  Olivia Pratt-Korbel was fatally shot in the chest as she sheltered behind her mother as a man fleeing "high-level" cannabis dealer Thomas Cashman tried to force his way into her home in August 2022. In another shocking gangland shooting near Liverpool in December 2022, a 24-year-old woman was killed in crossfire in a pub. Gunman Connor Chapman fired 12 shots intended for underworld rivals into a group of people, but killed beautician Elle Edwards as she enjoyed a night out. He is due to be sentenced later Friday.

Title: UK court told Kevin Spacey was a ‘sexual bully’
Body: Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was on Friday described as a “sexual bully”, as prosecutors opened their case against him in London for a string of alleged assaults. “Kevin Spacey Fowler is an actor; many of you will already know that,” lawyer Christine Agnew told a jury at Southwark Crown Court, using the star’s full name. “He is an extremely famous actor who has won a number of awards. He is also, the prosecution allege, a man who sexually assaults other men.” Agnew said Spacey, a two-time Academy Award winner for American Beauty and The Usual Suspects, did not respect personal boundaries or space. He was “a man who it would seem delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable, a sexual bully”, the lawyer alleged in her opening speech. “His preferred method of assault is,it appears, to grab aggressively other men in the crotch. On one occasion things went further than that.” Spacey, 63, denies three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. He has also pleaded not guilty to a further charge of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.  RELATED STORIES  The alleged offences, against four men who cannot be identified under English law, are said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013. Spacey was artistic director at London’s Old Vic Theatre from 2003 to 2015. He received an honorary knighthood for his services to theatre, arts education and international culture in 2016. Agnew said the actor had dismissed some of the allegations as “quite simply made up”, and maintained that others were consensual. ‘Damned lies’ The prosecutor alleged that Spacey, star of the political television drama House of Cards, had “abused the power and influence that his reputation and fame afforded him”. Some of the alleged offences involved “inappropriate and unwelcome” touching, as well as groping, she said. One alleged victim recalled Spacey making “crude and seedy sexual remarks” before grabbing him aggressively. Another alleged Spacey had assaulted him while he was asleep, it was claimed.   Agnew questioned how four men, who were all apparently unknown to one another, would make similar allegations. “Have they decided to manufacture allegations against the defendant in order to benefit financially?” Agnew asked. She told the jury Spacey would suggest that. But she said the prosecution case was that the actor used his “popularity and prominence, his illustriousness and influence... taking what and who he wanted, when he wanted”. Spacey’s lawyer Patrick Gibbs said his client – a US citizen – had come back to the UK to answer the allegations against him and recount “what actually happened”. He said some of what the jury will hear has been “deliberately exaggerated”. “Mr Spacey was rich and influential. What did they (the alleged victims) want from his wealth and from his influence and what do they still want, do you think?” he asked the jury. “You will soon hear, I suggest, some truths. You will soon hear some half-truths. You will also hear, I suggest... some deliberate exaggerations and you will hear many damned lies.” The case was adjourned until Monday.

Title: Night of fires, looting in Lille as protests sweep France
Body: A burned district office, another pelted with stones, "lots of looting": in Lille, in the north of France, a game of cat and mouse played out into the wee hours of Friday morning between authorities and protesters. As in other French cities, the metropolis of one and a half million near the Belgian border has been convulsed by at-times violent demonstrations since Tuesday's fatal police shooting of a 17-year-old named Nahel in Nanterre, near Paris. The incident revived longstanding grievances about policing and racial profiling in France's multiethnic suburbs, but some in Lille suggested the backlash had gone too far, even as they denounced the shooting.   In the district of Wazemmes, firefighters worked until after midnight to extinguish a blaze that damaged the ground floor and blackened the facade of the local district hall. "Burning a district hall is useless," said 22-year-old bus driver Sofiane, standing in front of the charred edifice as fireworks sounded in the distance. "The cop who did this did not have to do it", he said of the officer who shot Nahel, "but attacking public places, what does it serve?"   District councillor Brice Lauret, who had rushed to the scene, said the violence was "unacceptable". "I can understand anger, but not violence," he added. In another area, Fives, the district hall was targeted with stones, its windows broken out, according to Lille city hall, while an elementary school in the neighbourhood of Moulins was badly damaged by flames.   There was also "a lot of looting" of shops and supermarkets, it added, saying "very mobile small groups, composed of very young" individuals were striking "everywhere". The city had beefed up its security presence on Thursday, deploying elite RAID units, a helicopter and police drones after violence broke out the previous night, though the measures appeared to have little deterrent effect. The first incidents started around 9pm (1900 GMT), in the sector of the central police station, where authorities had prohibited gatherings after calls for a rally went out on social media. Mobile and scattered, small groups of young people set fire to trash cans and cars on a main artery. Some broke the windows of a supermarket, later emerging with bottles of soda. RAID officers, aboard an ATV and in an armoured vehicle, intervened several times, brandishing projectile launchers. "They are not showing any mercy; today they are shooting," commented one passerby who, like many interviewed by AFP, declined to identify himself. Tensions were also high in the nearby municipality of Roubaix, one of the poorest in France, where firefighters dashed from blaze to blaze throughout the night. Next to a theatre with broken-out windows, barricades burned as fireworks crisscrossed the sky. Near the train station, a hotel caught fire, sending its dozen or so residents fleeing into the streets. As firefighters battled the blaze, another was already starting nearby in a large office building, residents said. "In two days, they did what the Yellow Vests did in two years," said one pedestrian, referring to the spontaneous and sometimes violent anti-government protest movement that broke out in 2018. Not far away, a witness recounted having seen a group of about 50 people set fire to a brokerage company's office. A social centre in the city was also set on fire, according to Amine Elbahi, who ran unsuccessfully in the area in the last legislative elections. "The police, they feel free to do anything. They killed an innocent youth, they have to stop," said one 16-year-old passerby back in Lille. Another man in his 20s appeared to agree: "Nahel's death is too serious, it's unjustified."  "But the reaction is bad; degrading public services is useless," he added. "It's our money that will fix all this." You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Jean Paul Sofia's mourning mother hits back at cruel social media comments
Body: The mother of construction site accident victim Jean Paul Sofia has hit back at cruel comments on social media attacking her as she campaigns for justice for her 20-year-old son. There was an outpouring of support for the grieving mother after she was faced with insulting comments recently posted on Facebook.  Among the comments, someone in poor Maltese wrote: "Had you loved your son, at that age you would have sent him to school, not working in construction." Another added: "I think that had you given him a proper education he would have avoided this, poor chap."   Jean Paul was killed when the factory collapsed whilst under construction at the Corradino industrial estate. His mother has led calls for a public inquiry into the incident that took place on government land. Reacting to the comments, the campaigning mother replied: "Are these people serious? Those who knew JP (Jean Paul) knew how intelligent he was and how he stayed in school up to his A-levels. He was following a course for a private pilot's licence. We sent him to a secondary church school and always worked hard for him. "Friends drew him to that activity, and he was happy. Tell me, what more could we have done?  And in any case, no job makes anyone inferior and EVERYONE deserves protection.  "Those who know me know what a mother I was and remain. Those who want to think otherwise, it's up to them. I have a clear conscience and I am proud that he used to say he had the best mum he could have. "As to whoever has commented,  I hope he is an exemplary parent who can say what I have said about my son. His children might not be as proud of him as my son was of me, when they see this ignorance!"   She told Times of Malta that she could not expect any better from some people, who often used fake profiles. "But I am eternally grateful for the vast majority of people who support me," she said.   In an interview with Times of Malta earlier this month she described how her son's death had transformed her from a quiet woman to one who is determined to campaign for justice for the rest of her life, if necessary. She has confronted politicians outside parliament and earlier this week, strung up a banner on the railings of police headquarters that read: 'Who are you protecting?' Here battle for the government to appoint an independent public inquiry into the death of her son has been rebuffed, with the prime minister saying a magisterial inquiry is enough.  She strung up the banner outside police headquarters on Wednesday afternoon and told those present that she was launching a fund-raising campaign to continue her efforts for a public inquiry and for the full truth of what had happened to emerge.   RELATED STORIES  "I want to remind the police commissioner and the government that justice has not been served for Jean Paul. The guilty ones are still free and we are serving a life sentence," she said. She insisted she would continue to call for a public inquiry for the truth to come out. "I also want to see more effective laws. My son must not have died in vain." You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: France arrests dozens in unrest after police shooting
Body: President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday urged calm after 150 people were arrested and public buildings were attacked in angry protests over the police killing of a teenager that has incensed France. Nahel M., 17, was shot in the chest at point-blank range on Tuesday in an incident that has reignited debate in France about police tactics long criticised by rights groups. Cars and bins were torched in parts of Paris overnight and protesters launched fireworks at riot police, who fired flashball projectiles to try to disperse the angry crowds.   "We are sick of being treated like this. This is for Nahel, we are Nahel," said two young men calling themselves "Avengers" as they wheeled rubbish bins from a nearby estate to add to a burning barricade in the capital. As the situation has grown more volatile, Macron called an early morning crisis meeting of his ministers. Branding the overnight clashes "unjustifiable", Macron told the meeting the "last few hours have been marked by scenes of violence against police stations, but also schools and town halls... against institutions and the Republic." The violence is a deeply troubling development for Macron who had been looking to move past a half-year of sometimes violent protests that erupted over his controversial pension reform. There had already been clashes the previous evening and while Wednesday night began calmly, unrest erupted in other French cities, including Toulouse, Dijon and Lyon before violence after midnight hit the Paris region, where around 2,000 riot police had been deployed. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on Twitter as he announced the 150 arrests figure that the violence was "intolerable". He expressed support for police but added in an apparent swipe at the hard-left: "Shame on those who did not call for calm." In the region around the scene of Nahel M.'s killing, masked demonstrators dressed in black launched fireworks and firecrackers at security forces. A thick column of smoke billowed above the area where AFP journalists saw more than a dozen cars and garbage cans set ablaze and barriers blocking off roads. Graffiti sprayed on the walls of one building called for "justice for Nahel" and said, "police kill". In the working-class 18th and 19th districts of northeastern Paris, police fired flashballs to disperse protesters burning rubbish, but instead of leaving, the crowd responded by throwing bottles.  In the Essonne region south of the capital, a group set a bus on fire after forcing all the passengers off, police said, while in the Paris suburb of Clamart a tram was set on fire. In the southern city of Toulouse, several cars were torched and responding police and firefighters pelted with projectiles, a police source said, while authorities reported similar scenes in Dijon and Lyon. At France's second-largest prison complex, Fresnes, protesters attacked security at the entrance with fireworks, a police source told AFP.  "They did not enter the prison grounds. The police were quickly called in," the source added. The town hall of Mons-en-Baroeul outside the northern city of Lille was set on fire when some fifty hooded individuals stormed the building, the mayor told AFP Anger has grown over the killing as details have emerged over the circumstances of the incident. Police initially reported that an officer had shot at the teenager because he was driving at him, but this was contradicted by a video circulating on social media and authenticated by AFP. The footage shows the two policemen standing by the side of the stationary car, with one pointing a weapon at the driver. A voice is heard saying: "You are going to get a bullet in the head." The police officer then appears to fire as the car abruptly drives off. France is haunted by the prospect of a repeat of 2005 riots sparked by the death of two black boys during a police chase. Those protests resulted in around 6,000 people arrested. "There are all the ingredients for another explosion potentially," one government adviser told AFP on condition of anonymity. Last year, 13 people were killed after refusing to stop for police traffic checks, with a law change in 2017 that gave officers greater powers to use their weapons now under scrutiny. "What I see on this video is the execution by police of a 17-year-old kid, in France, in 2023, in broad daylight," said Greens party leader Marine Tondelier. But far-right leader Marine Le Pen said the officer was entitled to the "presumption of innocence".  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Sant Cassia murder: Claims that accused is medically unfit will not be contested
Body: The Attorney General will not stop the prosecution of a man first arrested 17 years ago and still awaiting trial for the murder of Baron Francis Sant Cassia, but the Office will not contest any allegation by the defence that the accused is medically unfit to stand trial, a court was told on Thursday. Carmel Camilleri, a 68-year old father-of-four, was arraigned in 2006 and accused of the fatal shooting which took place on October 27, 1988. He pleaded not guilty and has been on bail since.    RELATED STORIES  His health has deteriorated to the extent that he is wheelchair-bound and can no longer have a simple conversation. His lawyers in March filed a judicial protest arguing that they could not offer him legal advice and that the situation had resulted in a breach of his fundamental rights including his right to a fair trial within a reasonable time and his right to protection against inhuman and degrading treatment. Last year, a court of appeal confirmed that statements released by Camilleri in 2006 were not admissible as evidence since they had been given without the assistance of a lawyer.  As the accused’s medical condition worsened, his lawyers questioned why the Attorney General had allowed the case to drag on, while knowing that there was not a “shred of evidence” against Camilleri. The trial was scheduled for April but was postponed while the accused’s condition continued to be assessed and debated by the parties, after medical specialists pronounced Camilleri unfit to face trial. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera had ordered Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to attend Wednesday's sitting to explain the prosecution’s position. When the hearing got underway, lawyer Kevin Valletta, representing the Attorney General, informed the court that the AG would not issue a nolle prosequi in respect of Camilleri. However, if the defence formally raised the issue that the accused could not stand trial because of a medical impediment, the AG would not contest that allegation. In terms of article 625 of the Criminal Code, where the attorney general does not contest that allegation, “the court shall proceed as if the truth of that allegation had been proven.” Defence lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta requested some time to explain the situation to the accused’s family who were following proceedings in court. The accused himself, seated in a wheelchair, made no reaction whatsoever. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera upheld the request and deferred the case to next week.   During Camilleri's arraignment in 2006, Superintendent Pierre Calleja, who prosecuted together with Inspector Christopher Pullicino, said in court that the police had received confidential information about the involvement of the accused but when arrested, he had denied any involvement. However, when he was rearrested a few days later, the accused admitted it was he who had shot Baron Sant Cassia. When the police took him to the place where the murder had taken place, he explained to them how the murder was carried out and this description matched exactly what the police had found on the scene of the crime at the time. A second person, believed at the time to have commissioned the murder, was detained by the police, but never arraigned. Times of Malta reported at the time that police believed the accused had received a substantial sum of money to shoot Sant Cassia, who was 68 when he was killed by a single gunshot in front of his residence. It was believed that someone had called Sant Cassia on his phone shortly before he was shot at 6.30 p.m. by someone who was waiting for him outside his house. The baron was shot in the back from quite a close range as he was getting into his car.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: US actor Kevin Spacey due in UK court for sex offences trial
Body: Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was due in a London court on Wednesday to stand trial for a dozen sexual offences which allegedly occurred more than a decade ago.  The 63-year-old star of American Beauty and drama series House of Cards is facing a four-week trial at Southwark Crown Court in south London. He has been on unconditional bail since first appearing in court in Britain last year. Spacey's stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offences, although he has not been convicted of any crime. Last year he appeared at London's Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five offences against three men, including four counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. They allegedly took place in 2005 and 2008 in London, and in 2013 in Gloucestershire, western England. In November, prosecutors then announced seven additional charges involving another man, taking the total number of counts Spacey faces in the UK to 12. The fresh counts, allegedly committed between 2001 and 2004, comprise three offences of indecent assault, three of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. Spacey, whose full name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, appeared at Southwark Crown Court in January to deny all the new charges. He spoke only to confirm his identity and to enter the not guilty pleas.  None of the alleged victims can be identified under English law and reporting restrictions prevent further details being disclosed before trial.  RELATED STORIES  Spacey enjoyed a highly successful acting career with roles such as a middle-aged father lusting after a teen in American Beauty, a serial killer in Se7en and the villain in Superman Returns. He worked as artistic director at London's Old Vic Theatre between 2004 and 2015. In 2017, he was one of the first stars caught up in the global #MeToo movement and was accused of sexual assault by multiple young men. He was dropped from the final season of the political drama House of Cards and other projects. Last year a New York court dismissed a $40 million sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against Spacey. The complainant, actor Anthony Rapp, alleged the star had assaulted him when he was 14. He brought the civil case after being told it was too late to bring a criminal charge. In 2019, charges of indecent and sexual assault were dropped against Spacey in Massachusetts. In court appearances, Spacey has denied all allegations of sexual assault.

Title: One dead in 'gang' shooting in Sydney's Bondi neighbourhood
Body: A man was killed in Sydney's famed Bondi neighbourhood Tuesday, in what police described as a hit on a "major player" in the city's crime underworld. A police cordon was thrown up around one of Sydney's busiest shopping precincts after residents and rush-hour commuters were shocked to hear shots ring out from an underground parking lot not far from Bondi Beach. A 48-year-old man with an "extensive criminal history" was found dead in his vehicle.   The scene "bears the hallmarks of an organised crime murder" Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty told reporters. "We believe this is a targeted shooting and we believe it's a targeted shooting of a high-level organised crime identity." The man was not named, but was said to be "well known to police" and "obviously had a big target on his back".  A burnt-out Porsche was found nearby and is believed to be linked to the shooting. "This is Tuesday morning and Bondi Junction. We don't expect this to happen," said Doherty. Olivia Scanlan, a 27-year-old local actress and dancer, said she was "shocked" by the shooting in a neighbourhood, which is usually associated with surf and backpackers rather than gangland hits. "I have friends that come here to visit and they think, 'Wow, Australia is a dream'," she told AFP. "They think it is so safe and this is so different to home." "You can walk around at night time and feel like nothing is going to happen." Despite having a population of just 26 million people, Australia is one of the world's most lucrative markets for recreational drugs, with street prices far above those found in Europe or North America. In 2019-2020, the last period for which data is available, some 39 tonnes of drugs were seized by police and 166,321 drug arrests occurred. Local motorcycle gangs have increasingly made contact with Mexican and other cartels to bring drugs into the country, according to Australian authorities.

Title: Witness says he felt afraid, but was not threatened by Lilu King brothers
Body: A former business partner of 'Lilu King’ who alleged that an attempt was made to influence testimony he gave in court, declared on Monday that he had testified “the truth” and never felt threatened or pressured. The man, whose name was banned by the court, was back on the witness stand in criminal proceedings against Mohamed Ali Ahmed Massarati, 31, and Mahmoud Mustafa Mohammed Aldabah, 26, brothers of Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, the Paceville entrepreneur, known as Lilu King, currently charged with money laundering. The two were arrested a fortnight ago after the witness testified how they had approached him days before in an apparent bid to influence his testimony. The brothers were charged over that incident and were remanded in custody after pleading not guilty. When their case kicked off on Monday, the witness testified about a call he had received from one of the brothers on June 7 while working at the Valletta Waterfront. They messaged each other to confirm his location and that evening, around 7pm the brothers arrived in a taxi. Shown printed screenshots of a WhatsApp chat, the witness confirmed the messages he had exchanged on his phone starting on June 6. One of the brothers had called saying he wished to meet him and also mentioned some “appointment with Dr Franco”. “But I never met Dr Franco,” said the witness. As a former business partner of Elmushraty, the witness said that he had known the accused since 2019 or so. That evening at the Valletta Waterfront, he was asked to say that a black Range Rover with the 'Lilu King' number plate actually belonged to him and that it had been purchased by the company he operated. “Yes it was bought in my name but I never drove it,” explained the witness. He said he had clearly told the brothers that he could not state such a thing as he had asked the car dealer to transfer the vehicle, along with some €11,000 in fines racked up, to Elmushraty. He had taken steps to cancel the registration in his name so that the vehicle would be registered in the name of the actual owner, namely Elmushraty. He could never pay for such a vehicle in cash, he insisted. The witness said he had also told the brothers that “everyone knew that the car belonged to Lilu King”. It was not just because of the number plate had his nickname but “because I cannot buy such a vehicle,” he stressed. “I testified the truth.” The witness said that after having testified in the proceedings against Elmushraty, he told police he felt afraid. “Why are you afraid?” asked inspector Tonjoe Farrugia. “I wished for protection so as not to have problems with them. Just protection for me and my family. I’m not saying they are criminals. I never said that,” explained the witness. “So you did not feel threatened, bribed or pressured?” asked defence lawyer Charles Mercieca. “To date, no,” replied the witness. The prosecution requested the court to issue a protection order in favour of the witness and his young son. The defence objected, arguing that the witness had just testified there had been no threats, promises or pressure. “His only fear was due to the scale of the case. He never felt threatened by these two individuals,” argued the lawyer. The court, presided over by Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, upheld the request. The court is to decree on another request for the appointment of a court expert to extract data from the brothers’ phones. The prosecution said it needed that data to confirm whether there had been any communication with other third parties. The defence strongly objected, arguing that the prosecution were on “a fishing expedition” and that such investigations should have been conducted before the men were arraigned. The case continues next month. Inspector Tonjoe Farrugia prosecuted. Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Jacob Magri were defence counsel.

Title: Two men found inside a stolen car remanded in custody
Body: Two men spotted on Saturday inside a car that had been reported stolen two nights before were remanded in custody upon their arraignment on Monday.  Wayne Catania, 32, and Keith Bonello, 43, both unemployed, pleaded not guilty to assisting an unidentified third party in stealing the vehicle, knowingly receiving the stolen car as well as unlawful possession of heroin and psychotropic substances.  Catania was separately charged with driving the car without a licence and insurance cover as well as ignoring a no-entry sign. Both were charged with relapsing.  Prosecuting Inspector Andrew Agius Bonello explained it all began on June 22 when police received information about a van that was reported stolen the previous day.  Inside that van was a key for a Smart Fortwo model that was subsequently also stolen.  On Saturday, Rapid Intervention officers going through Marsa spotted the Smart vehicle. Two men were inside the car.  At the arraignment, both men were assisted by legal aid lawyer Yanika Bugeja who informed the court that when the case proceeded, it would be better for either of the accused to be assisted by a different lawyer.  The court, presided by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, minuted that request accordingly for the Legal Aid Agency to take note. No request for bail was made in respect of Bonello in view of the fact that he was currently homeless.  As for Catania, he had spoken to his mother on Sunday and had a fixed address, the lawyer said. The accused himself explained that his mum would willingly take him in as long as he kept out of trouble.  His mother would need to confirm that on oath, observed the court. The prosecution objected to the request, pointing out that on Sunday the accused had told police that he had been turned down by his mum. The request was left pending until the accused’s mother testified.  Inspectors Andrew Agius Bonello and Ritianne Gauci prosecuted. Lawyer Yanika Bugeja was legal aid counsel.

Title: Police seize 54kg of cannabis in St Paul's Bay, one man arrested
Body: A 48-year-old man is under arrest in connection with a 54kg haul of cannabis on Friday, the police said in a brief statement on Saturday. Officers made the discovery following an operation at a residence in St Paul’s Bay. Police surrounded the residence, searched it and arrested the man, who is an Italian national. Police have estimated that the haul carries a street value of €880,000. The man is scheduled to be arraigned on Saturday afternoon in a court presided by magistrate Gianella Camilleri Busuttil. He is currently being held at police headquarters in Floriana.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Victims stung for millions in French child porn scam
Body: Police in France and Belgium said Friday they had smashed a criminal ring that used fake court summonses accusing people of watching child pornography to extort at least €3.5 million. The phishing scam involved false emails from police, judges or institutions such as Europol threatening victims with prosecution unless they paid a "fine". Police said they arrested 18 people in France and one in Belgium in an operation on Monday, with all but three of the suspects ordered to appear in court on fraud charges. One of the victims - who had been stung twice by the crooks - committed suicide, and six others may have also potentially killed themselves, police said. "We thought that the fraud was being run by one central structure," said Colonel Thomas Andreu, head of one of the special French police units. "However, it turned out to be several little teams which were not linked."  The sums extracted from the victims ranged from less than €5,000 to up to €200,000, he told AFP. The scam began at the start of 2021, leading the cybercrime section of the Paris prosecutor's office to open an investigation.  By June 2022 some 400 complaints relating to the scam had been made to authorities. Commissioner Christophe Durand, of the French OCLCTIC anti-cybercrime unit, said the "victims had suffered real distress". Some of the money extorted from the men - who were aged on average around 60 - was spent in France, but most was sent to the Ivory Coast and other African countries.  The man who was hit twice was first made to pay €5,978 before the criminals asked him for a further €7,480.   "Feeling powerless and trapped, he took his own life," the police said. The suspects are aged between 20 and 50. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Police head of financial crime Sandro Camilleri falls victim to online scam
Body: The head of a police financial crime unit has had his Facebook account compromised, days after the force warned people about a ‘confirmation code’ scam. Superintendent Sandro Camilleri, who heads the anti money laundering department within the Financial Crime Investigation Department (FCID), was locked out of his own Facebook accounts last Sunday. His personal Facebook and Messenger account is now being used by hackers to attempt to lure people to invest in financial scams. A police report has been filed about the case. Last week, the police shared a post on their Facebook page warning people to watch out for a new phishing scam that allows hackers to gain access to people’s accounts.   The attack is initiated by an already compromised account of a friend, who uses Facebook Messenger to ask for urgent help to get back into his or her Facebook account.  It asks for the user’s mobile number or email and then sends a recovery code for you to share with the attacker hiding behind the identity of the friend.  “When providing this code, the victim will be giving access to third parties to their social media account,” the police had warned. It advised Facebook Messenger users to be cautious when replying to messages that seem to be coming from the real accounts of their Facebook friends.   The scam is easy to fall for as it uses real social media accounts that have previously been hacked and it mimics a genuine Facebook account recovery feature called ‘Trusted Contacts’. In fact, the scammer has actually initiated a ‘Forgot my password’ request and duped the user into providing details that allow the hacker to hijack the Facebook account. Camilleri’s profile is now being used to try to lure his friends into financial scams by sending them private messages. On Sunday, Camilleri’s Facebook page uploaded a post saying that life has “been treating me so good” since a €3,500 investment yielded him €23,000 within hours. A private message disseminated through his Messenger account also urged his friends to start investing by sending a text message to a US WhatsApp number.   This is typical behaviour of hackers who have used the phishing scam to hijack real Facebook profiles. Most of the posts and messages attempt to give the impression that the victim became rich overnight by investing money online and now wants their friends to do it as well. Camilleri was appointed to head the police unit that is tasked with investigating major money laundering cases last September. One of the most public of Malta’s high-ranking police officers, he has previously fought for the rights of police officers and founded and headed a police union.  RELATED STORIES  He was one of the earliest advocates of police body-worn cameras and has developed a relatively popular online following over the years, meaning his account could be used as bait to many unsuspecting friends who know and trust him. The police said it could not comment on individual cases. However, a spokesperson for the cybercrime unit said that anyone who falls victim to such a scam should warn their friends and contacts and tell them to ignore posts and messages from the compromised profile. “The victim should also report the case directly to the social media platform to attempt to take back access to their profile,” they said. “It is also advised that other users also report specific posts to have them removed from the profile. “Unfortunately, the profile will be removed at the discretion of the platform, even after being contacted by the police.

Title: Bernice Cassar’s family to intervene in Roderick Cassar’s femicide case
Body: The family of Bernice Cassar have been authorised to intervene in proceedings filed by the murdered woman’s husband, Roderick, challenging the new femicide law which he claims to be highly discriminatory, sexist and counterproductive. Relatives of the mother-of-two, who was assaulted and shot outside her workplace at Corradino Industrial Estate last November, had filed an application in the name of Joseph Cilia and other family members, requesting intervention in the constitutional case. Roderick Cassar’s lawyers immediately flagged their objection to the request when the court was informed last month. Roderick Cassar became the first person to be charged with the aggravated crime of femicide which was introduced under the Criminal Code a year ago, thus making him liable to a harsher punishment. He is pleading not guilty to the wilful murder of his estranged wife. While criminal proceedings continue, his lawyers filed separate proceedings before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction arguing that in terms of the new amendment the accused was placed at a disadvantage simply because the victim was a woman. It logically followed that the murder of a man was now considered less grievous than that of a woman, when all parties in the same identical position should be treated equally. The new law, they argued, also eliminated the possibility of the defence pleading “sudden passion” when one or more of the aggravating factors subsisted and the crime fell within the concept of femicide. When the case resumed on Thursday, the court, presided over by Madam Justice Anna Felice, decreed that after taking note of the replies filed by the victim’s family and the State Advocate, the request to intervene was “justified.” The case continues in October. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono are assisting the applicant. Lawyers Julian Farrugia and Corinne Pace appeared for the State Advocate. Lawyers Marita Pace Dimech, Rodianne Sciberras and Anne Marie Cutajar are assisting the victim’s family. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Driver spotted man picking up pitkali crate minutes before fatal motorcycle skid
Body: A driver described to police how she saw a “white-haired man” pick up a dropped pitkalija crate minutes before motorcyclist Marie Claire Lombardi skidded on olives on the same spot and died of her injuries, a court was told. The account was shared in court by a police sergeant testifying in the compilation of evidence against 79-year-old van driver, Joseph Cortis, who is pleading not guilty to the involuntary homicide of the biker. According to the sergeant from Rabat police station, she received a call from a woman on October 26, four days after the incident. The woman said she was driving past the intersection of the Rabat road with the road leading to Buqana, when she spotted a crate on the road belonging to the Pitkalija fruit and vegetable distribution centre.  She also noticed a blue van that was stationary, slowing down traffic. The eyewitness described a “white-haired man” who stooped to pick up the crate. On the day of the accident, the officer said she had just arrived at the Rabat police station on night duty starting at 6.30pm, when calls poured in about the accident in the area “taħt l-Imdina” (below Mdina). She rushed onsite with a colleague and found the victim’s motorcycle on the road leading to Buqana. Marie Claire Lombardi had already been taken to hospital. The busy thoroughfare was closed off with police tape.   The officer said she noticed “some sort of material on the ground” which, on closer inspection, turned out to be “olive remains.” The policewoman snapped photos of that material with her mobile phone and immediately informed her superiors. Those images are to be exhibited in court at the next sitting. Information from the hospital indicated that the victim was in critical condition and in danger of dying. The sergeant set about trying to identify the biker so that she could inform her relatives before they got to know about the accident through some other source. She then headed to the victim’s home where Marie Claire’s husband, Aldo, opened the door. She later accompanied him to the hospital.   Upon arrival, a doctor broke the news that Marie Claire had not made it, recalled the witness, as the victim’s husband broke down in court, comforted by relatives, including his sister-in-law who were present at the hearing. Under cross-examination by the defence lawyer, the witness said that the “patch” of squashed olives was on the Ħemsija road. There were two sizeable patches. When asked to give a rough estimate of their size, she said that they were larger than the circumference of the witness stand, but could produce the pictures which she had taken that day. The court is to schedule an onsite visit at the accident scene. The case continues in October. Inspector Roderick Attard prosecuted. Lawyer Patrick Valentino was defence counsel. Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Attorney General asks for retrial in Msida police station rape case
Body: The Attorney General has requested a retrial in the case of a police constable cleared of raping a female colleague at the Msida police station. In an appeal, the AG asked the court to overturn a decision by the judge presiding over the trial who ruled as inadmissible a statement in which the accused confessed to raping his colleague. The 33-year-old police constable was cleared of rape last March but found guilty of harassing a second woman, a teenage recruit. The policeman, who cannot be named by court order, was sentenced to one year in prison suspended for two years. The AG has now appealed the case, asking the court to accept the statement and proceed to order a retrial. In an appeal hearing before Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Edwina Grima and Giovanni Grixti, the parties debated the inadmissibility or otherwise of the incriminating statement released by the officer in 2018. Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Edward Gatt argued that the confession was not legally valid because of a change in the law concerning how an arrested person should be cautioned. When the law was amended in November 2016 to introduce the right to legal assistance during interrogation, the caution was also changed. The interrogation of the officer took place in March 2018. Debono argued that the caution read out and typed “in the smallest ever font size” on the statement was not in line with the 2016 amendment. It included the inference rule – which no longer applied – namely that whatever the accused omitted to state could lead to inferences against him. Police had thus restricted the accused in what he said and this had “terrified him”, Debono argued. While the pre-2016 caution was to the effect that an inference of guilt could be drawn by a court if the suspect avails himself of legal assistance prior to interrogation, the law was changed to the complete opposite after 2016. The new rule states that no inference of guilt can be drawn and this, the defence claimed, was no technicality but a radical overhaul of the previous position, having enormous implications on the suspect’s legal rights. Deputy Attorney General Philip Galea Farrugia insisted that while it was not being contested that the caution was an outdated one, this did not change the contents of the statement. He objected to a request for a ruling on this aspect before dealing with the rest of the appeal, insisting that there was nothing stopping the court from ordering a retrial. The court deferred the case to July 10 for a decision on the matter. The alleged victim testified during the trial that the accused raped her at the Msida police station when they were both on duty in February 2018 and again the following month.  Another colleague, a 19-year-old recruit, told the court she had been sexually harassed by the officer, including once inside a police car while out on night duty and another time while waiting outside the law courts in Valletta.  RELATED STORIES  The accused had made comments about her bottom, had placed his hand under her when she sat on the passenger seat, tried to touch her leg in the car and spoke about his hand slipping from the gear stick. During the trial, prosecutors told the judge that both women had been left traumatised by the abuse committed by someone who was duty-bound to prevent crime. The presiding judge, Consuelo Scerri Herrera, likened the Msida police station to a “brothel” but said that the lax and permissive behaviour there did not necessarily mean there was criminal wrongdoing. She said that the alleged rape victim’s version was not credible and cleared the officer of all charges in her regard. A detailed analysis of her account showed inconsistencies and it was “more likely” that the sex was consensual. Normally rape victims would try to do everything to avoid their aggressor but in this case the woman changed her shift to be at Msida, sat in front of him at a meal, and did not file for transfer after the alleged attack. However, the defendant had overstepped the mark when it came to his behaviour towards the second woman, the judge ruled.

Title: Italian MEP charged in EU graft scandal
Body: Belgian prosecutors on Wednesday charged Italian European Parliament member Andrea Cozzolino with corruption and money laundering in a high-profile graft scandal.  The socialist MEP, 60, flew into Belgium on Monday for questioning after being arrested four months ago in Italy on an international warrant.  Cozzolino, who denies any wrongdoing, is the third lawmaker to be charged over an alleged bribery scheme involving Qatar and Morocco aimed at swaying the European Parliament.  He was released under supervision after being charged with "public corruption, (involvement in a) criminal organisation and money laundering", Belgium's federal prosecutor said.  The Qatargate corruption scandal has rocked the European Parliament and pushed EU institutions to speed up reforms aimed at curbing outside influence. It erupted in December when Belgian police detained several political figures and uncovered over 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) in cash during a string of raids.  Both Qatar and Morocco deny involvement in any corruption.  The Belgian investigation was buffeted Monday by a decision to replace a key judge overseeing the case for a potential conflict of interest.  Belgian media reported Michel Claise stepped down due to business links between his son and the son of an MEP whose name has figured in the probe.  The federal prosecutor has said it expects the investigation to be completed by the end of the year.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'She wasn't the Bernice I knew': Cousin describes woman's fear day before murder
Body: Bernice Cassar, the mother-of-two shot dead last November, confided in her cousin a day before the murder that she was "scared” hoping that police would arrest her husband, who had “completely lost control.” The following morning, on November 22, Roderick Cassar shot his estranged wife at the Corradino Industrial Estate just outside her workplace after months of domestic turmoil that saw her move out of the matrimonial home. Roderick Cassar now stands accused of wilful murder and is the first person to face charges under the femicide amendment to the Criminal Code. His lawyers are challenging the constitutionality of that amendment in separate proceedings. When the compilation of evidence proceedings continued on Wednesday, Petra Jones told the court she was very close to her cousin Bernice throughout their childhood. Jones was unaware of the troubles her cousin was facing in her marriage until she was told that Bernice had left her matrimonial home in Qrendi in May and moved in with her parents in Zebbuġ. “I was shocked,” said the witness, as she recalled her first impression when she chanced upon her cousin outside her relatives’ house. “She wasn’t the Bernice I knew.” From that day, the two cousins began to meet as they accompanied their kids to religious doctrine classes or to the playground, sometimes going for a coffee at a Zebbuġ cafeteria. They also went for an hour’s walk early every morning. When she asked Bernice about the day’s plans, she would say that it all depended on whether and when Roderick would call for the kids. He never stuck to the hours agreed upon and that meant that Bernice had to put up with his irregular schedule, often getting to know “just half an hour or so ahead.” She would tell her cousin that she had been manipulated by her husband “from day one” and was convinced that keeping irregular hours when calling for the couple’s children was “another manipulative technique.” When, in July, Roderick was admitted to hospital, he would insist on seeing the kids and that their mother - not anyone else - was to accompany them to hospital.   With a daily job until 4pm, housework and other family responsibilities, it was a tall order for Bernice but she tried to take the children to visit their father. “He manipulates me even from his hospital bed,” she confided to her cousin. One day, while the two were having coffee at a cafeteria the accused called the couple’s son, asking him to switch the call to video so that he could see where Bernice was. She told her son that she would call his father back later. But in that hour, Roderick called some eight or nine times, testified the witness, recalling Bernice’s words that she “would never recover since he would keep chasing her.” The witness recalled how, following an incident on Mother’s Day when Roderick allegedly placed a knife against Bernice's neck after their umpteenth argument in the presence of their young children, Bernice had plucked up courage and walked out, only taking “the clothes she was wearing.” “I can’t go back….He showed no remorse….This is not going to change,” the victim later confided to her relatives, also worried by the fact that those violent scenes were also badly affecting her kids. In June, the accused would constantly call his estranged wife, who did all she could to cut down on that communication, which included long telephone conversations where he would plead with her to go back. Bernice had insisted that the only way of fighting the “manipulation that existed from day one” was to reduce contact. But she was afraid that Roderick would damage her car or drum up some scene at her workplace. “Funnily enough, she would also confess that she pitied him,” went on her cousin. He was constantly criticising her, making her feel “worthless,” that she got nothing right and that “it was all her fault.” It was quite a feat for Bernice even to go back to her Qrendi home to fetch summer clothing for herself and the kids as well as their toys, which the accused never allowed them to take to their grandparents’ home.   “She had planned it all very carefully,” recalled the witness, describing how Bernice had managed it while her husband was in hospital. Following another violent episode when she visited the accused at the hospital and he had placed two fingers on her neck, and later damaged her car door, Bernice filed a police report. “August was quiet,” and her cousin said she had felt “somewhat more secure,” but there was one message from her husband after her son told him he had been to Għar Lapsi with his mother’s relatives. “I’ll blow your head off in front of your father,” the accused allegedly threatened Bernice. November was the month when Bernice realised that she could never get away from her husband. “I would like to pay you back but the kids would suffer,” he texted the victim another time. When she blocked him so as to focus on her work, he resorted to her work number and email instead. “She once found 30 missed calls.” The witness wrapped up her account with her cousin’s final message on November 21. “I’m pretty scared now. If only they’d arrest him this week. He’s completely lost control,” Bernice had messaged. Bernice had also sought help from a psychotherapist, facing difficulties in attending sessions because of her husband’s habit of calling for their children at irregular hours.  But she managed to attend some 15 sessions between May and November.  “Her symptoms were very much in line with trauma,” explained the psychotherapist when testifying on Wednesday.  Bernice would not cry much but “her face would go cold, her voice would drop and she trembled a lot,” said the witness as she described the patient’s demeanour throughout those sessions.  She was not eating much, was missing out on sleep and was visibly very scared. She had recounted the episodes she had been through with her husband and was still facing even after she left home.  Sometimes he would call her during sessions, checking on her.  Her children were also scared, telling her not to go out fearing that something would happen to her.  She had also lost weight as the months passed, went on the witness.  “She was terrified,” said the psychotherapist. In fact, the victim would go to work, the psychotherapy sessions and home.  Their last session took place on November 5.  That day “she [Bernice] seemed better…”said the witness, recalling how the patient had strengthened her will to move on. “Enough. This cannot go on,” Bernice had said, after making up her mind to leave her matrimonial home.  “She loved her husband a lot. So her own safety took second place,” the psychotherapist remarked.  The case, being heard by Magistrate Joseph Mifsud, continues next month.  Inspectors Shaun Pawney and Paul Camilleri prosecuted together with AG lawyer Angele Vella. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono are defence counsel. Lawyers Stefano Filletti, Marita Pace Dimech, Anne Marie Cutajar and Rodianne Sciberras are appearing for Bernic Cassar's family.

Title: Murder trial: Victim had spoken to police commissioner about threats
Body: A man who disappeared in 2015 and is believed to have been murdered had spoken to the then police commissioner about how he was being threatened by Sicilians he did not know, and how his former business partner was likely involved, a court heard on Tuesday. Albert Brian Rosso was last seen on  October 10, 2005, and police believe he had an argument with fisherman Anthony Bugeja, and was shot dead, in the presence of another fisherman, Piero Di Bartolo. He was then placed in a sack and dumped at sea. Bugeja and Di Bartolo on Monday started undergoing trial by jury for murder.  Testifying in the trial, then police commissioner John Rizzo said he had advised Rosso not to travel to Sicily for the time being and to flag anything suspicious. Then a week or so before the disappearance, Rizzo said Rosso called him mentioning a “notorious man” from Marsaxlokk who was seen in the company of a Sicilian man. Rosso’s suspicions fell on the two men who appeared to have struck up a friendship in the previous week.   But when Rizzo later investigated that last bit of information, it turned out that the two men had been friends for a while and that was why they were seen together. “I did not get to tell him [Rosso] that,” said Rizzo. Police investigations, he said, included searches on fishing boats and residences. Police also spoke to Rosso’s workmates who recalled how that October morning he had received a call from Bugeja, whom he went to meet, saying that he would be back. But he never did and all calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi, Rizzo recalled that Rosso had told him about having filed some report to a Sicilian police officer about the threats he was facing.   When the trial continued after the lunch break, Andreina Fenech Farrugia, a former senior scientific officer who shared an office with the victim at San Luċjan aquaculture centre, recalled how that last day she had seen Rosso sitting at his desk, staring blankly at the computer monitor, head in his hands. Farrugia could not recall many details, explaining that at the time of Rosso’s disappearance, she had supplied all information, still fresh in her mind, to the police. “What I do recall is that he was very worried.” Under further questioning, at times even by presiding judge Consuelo Scerri Herrera, the witness recalled Rosso telling her about “some woman who was calling him for money.”   Rosso was in some negotiations about a fishing vessel, she said. He was normally a “lively person” who chatted to all, but that morning when she got to the office at around 7:30am she found Rosso staring at the monitor “holding his head in his hands.” Soon after he told her, “I’m going out.” But he did not say where and she did not ask. The following day, their superior summoned them to inform them that the police were expected to speak to them because no one knew where Rosso was. Former Fisheries Director General Anthony Gruppetta testified how he had received a call from the police asking whether they could check if Rosso had been locked in at his workplace. Gruppetta had accompanied police to San Luċjan late that night, searched through the building but Rosso was nowhere to be found. He had known Rosso for many years, Gruppetta said. Besides his government job, Rosso had other business interests including a trawler’s licence registered in his name. He had improved his vessel to meet EU licence requirements and bought the new Desiree from some Adriatic port, engaging an Italian captain with whom he was to share the profits. However, relations with the captain eventually turned sour and Rosso began to negotiate with Bugeja to take over the captain’s part-ownership of the vessel. There was a big argument between Rosso and the Italian captain, whose name Gruppetta could not recall. What he did recall was Rosso telling him that the Italian was “threatening to come back and burn his vessel.” Just days before he went missing, Rosso had asked the director for leave to go to the police commissioner and around the same time, also told him that he was carrying a firearm around with him, the witness added. The trial continues. AG lawyers Angele Vella and Andrea Zammit are prosecuting. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono are counsel to Bugeja. Lawyer Roberto Montalto is counsel to Di Bartolo.

Title: Fireworks let off in public area near playground in Valletta
Body: Police are investigating an incident in which fireworks were allegedly let off from an open public space in Valletta on Saturday night. The equipment used was reported to have been placed on land that lies at the foot of the Siege Bell Memorial. A Valletta resident who was taking a stroll there said the area was completely accessible to the public and people were walking around the unmanned equipment unsuspecting. Reuben Grima said he was “horrified”.   “I stumbled over a set of fireworks set up for launching, just within the gate on the ramp in the immediate vicinity of the children’s playground,” he said. Half a minute later, a man who claimed to have a permit for the operation approached him and warned him the equipment was going to be used to let off fireworks a few minutes later and that there were two other sets of equipment a few metres away.  RELATED STORIES  The public space at the foot of the memorial is mostly frequented by tourists but it also has a bench and a small playground for children at one end – where the other fireworks equipment was set up. “I was absolutely appalled and horrified at the lack of consideration to health and safety,” Grima said. “There were no danger warning signs and the place was not closed off to the public in any way. “The man told me he was not manning the equipment when I found it because there were three sets in all and he couldn’t man all of them at once. “Just imagine if some children had come along at that moment and tried to fiddle with the equipment. It could have been tragic.” Grima said he warned tourists to steer clear of the area and left. Shortly afterwards, the fireworks were let off.   Later that night he reported the incident to the police and asked them to investigate the “glaring safety breaches that occurred that evening, which could have had tragic consequences, and to ensure they are not repeated”. Police said an investigation was under way. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Foreign workers fleeced by agencies, but Identity Malta can do nothing about it
Body: Workers looking for a job in Malta are often charged thousands of euros by foreign recruitment agencies - but Identity Malta's CEO says there is nothing the agency can do about it.   Times of Malta contacted Identity Malta after an illegal recruitment agency in the Philippines offering jobs in Malta was closed by the country’s authorities.   The Philippines agency, operating without a licence, charged €7,000 as a processing fee for those hoping to find work in Malta or Poland as hotel workers, cleaners, or waiters.   “We often hear that in foreign jurisdictions, especially in Asia, agents charge up to €12,000 for their services,” agency CEO Mark Mallia said.   RELATED STORIES  But Identity Malta cannot do anything about it, he said.  “Identity Malta does not have any legal authority over practices and actions happening abroad,” Mallia added.     “Throughout the process, Identity Malta Agency only deals with the employers and applicants themselves and does not recognise any other third parties”.  The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) in the Philippines shut down OVM Visa Assistance and Travel Consultancy at the beginning of this month after investigations showed the company was providing foreign recruitment services without a licence.     The company was charging prospective workers ₱420,000 (€7,000) in processing fees, a downpayment of ₱60,000 (€1,000) and an additional ₱100,000 (€1,650) once a work permit was issued, according to the DMW.  The recruitment agency’s owner will be charged with illegal recruitment, the DMW said.   "Surveillance operations conducted by the DMW-MWPB revealed that OVM offered jobs as kitchen helpers, housekeepers, waiters, and waitresses in Malta and Poland," it said. The number of non-EU workers in Malta increased tenfold in a decade. In 2011, fewer than 5,000 foreign nationals outside the EU were working in Malta. The number increased to over 50,000 by August 2022.     A significant portion of those workers come from the Philippines. According to Jobsplus data, there were more than 8,200 Filipinos registered as working in Malta in December 2022. The only non-EU country with more of its nationals working in Malta at that point was India.   RELATED STORIES  Most third-country nationals (TCNs) need a single work permit that expires yearly to live and work in Malta legally.    TCNs who need a visa to get to Malta face a lengthier process.  Local companies often make use of temping agencies to fill employment gaps, meaning that workers are subcontracted to companies but are technically employed by recruitment agencies.   Several have been stained by workers’ rights controversies.    RecruitGiant engaged food couriers with an attractive employment contract, only to make them sign a second contract with much less favourable conditions when they arrived in Malta.    When workers resigned in protest the company informed them they had to pay €4,000 for quitting, Times of Malta revealed last August.    An April investigation also revealed that food delivery couriers employed by several agencies are still working under precarious conditions despite government regulations.

Title: Petition found in box that stopped Abe murder hearing
Body: A suspicious package that prompted the cancellation of a hearing for the man accused of murdering former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe contained only a petition, and no explosives, local media said Tuesday. Tetsuya Yamagami had been due to make his first appearance before a court in western Japan's Nara on Monday, accused of shooting the former leader last July. But the session was "cancelled as staff were evacuated from the building after a suspicious item was delivered to the court", a court spokesman told AFP.  Police were called after the object set off a metal detector, local police said. It was then moved to an open area, where bomb specialists in protective gear investigated. "But no explosives or hazardous substances were found," a police spokesman told AFP, without giving further details. Public broadcaster NHK said the box contained a printout of a Change.org petition seeking a lenient sentence for Yamagami. The petition has amassed 13,000 signatures since last year, and its organiser admitted to NHK that they had sent the document to the court. "I sent the signatures in the hope that they would be seen by as many interested parties as possible," the broadcaster quoted the person as saying, without identifying them. "As they were thick and it was raining, I put them in cardboard boxes... There was never any intention to obstruct justice." The sender contacted the police themselves after learning that the box had triggered a security alert, the Kyodo news agency said. The court and police declined to confirm the reports. Yamagami, 42, faces charges of murder and violation of arms control laws, and could face the death penalty if convicted. He reportedly targeted Abe - Japan's best-known politician and longest-serving prime minister - over his ties to the Unification Church, the global sect whose members are sometimes referred to as "Moonies". The suspect is believed to have resented the church over large donations his mother made that bankrupted his family. Details of his upbringing have stoked anger in Japan against the Unification Church and garnered Yamagami sympathy, with supporters sending him donations and signing the petition calling for leniency. The Unification Church was founded in Korea in the 1950s by self-styled messiah Sun Myung Moon. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'Abominable' shooting of 11-year-old British girl shocks French village
Body: A village in northwestern France where a Dutch retiree allegedly shot dead an 11-year-old British girl and gravely wounded her two parents was in shock Monday over the "abominable" violence. "It's a tragedy," said Kim McKanney, 64, a British pensioner out with her poodle a few hundred metres from the scene of the crime. "I'm shocked and upset that a family has been affected like this and a child killed in a little village which is so quiet, peaceful and friendly," she added, looking close to tears although she did not know the victims. "You might expect it in a city but not here." Sitting in the Monts d'Aree hills in western Brittany, the isolated hamlet of Plonevez-du-Faou had been home to the British family since 2019. The father, Adrien T, began clearing vegetation and detritus from his land, formerly the site of a sawmill - drawing the ire of the neighbouring couple aged 70 and 69 known locally as "the Belgians", although prosecutors say they had Dutch nationality. With the neighbours bothered by the noise of Adrien's chainsaw and by the fact their house was now visible from the road, the town hall initially stepped in to mediate. "We could see (the neighbour) was griping but there wasn't anything at all alarming" about the dispute, mayor Marguerite Bleuzen said. "It was (Adrien's) land, he can do what he likes with it." Aside from the friction with their neighbours, the British family quickly put down roots in their village, sending their daughters to nearby schools. Described as "a lovely person", the mother worked as a home carer for elderly people. The family also helped organise village parties, even allowing visitors to park on their land. "They're very nice, very kind, always happy to help," said a close neighbour in his 80s who asked not to be named. He drew a contrast between the family and the suspected shooter, who he said he had "never seen face-to-face" since the couple arrived in 2017. "We never saw them. No contact, nothing at all," added the elderly man, who said that "nothing has ever happened here" in all the years since he arrived in 1948. "No one knew" the suspect, agreed mayor Bleuzen, who described his appearance when arrested as "a little guy with long white hair, a long beard, and completely wild-looking". "What on earth could have been going on in his head?" she wondered. Saturday's multiple shootings were "appalling, abominable," said one local resident as she left white roses on the threshold of the British family's home. The slain girl "was the same age as my grandson, I'm really moved. Who wouldn't be?" she added, herself appearing close to tears. A source close to the investigation told AFP that a large amount of cannabis had been found in the suspect's home when it was searched by police. Prosecutors from nearby city Brest will hold a press conference later Monday. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: I have committed no offence: Scottish ex-leader Nicola Sturgeon
Body: Updated 8.15m Scotland's former leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted Sunday she had done nothing wrong after police questioned her as part of an investigation into the finances of the country's ruling party. "To find myself in the situation I did today when I am certain I have committed no offence is both a shock and deeply distressing," she wrote in a statement issued after police released her following her arrest earlier Sunday. "I would never do anything to harm either the SNP or the country," she added, referring to Scotland's dominant political force, the Scottish National Party (SNP). Given the ongoing investigation, there was a limit to what she could say, she added. But she insisted: "Innocence is not just a presumption I am entitled to in law. I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing." A statement earlier Sunday from Police Scotland said: "A 52-year-old woman who was arrested earlier today as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party, has been released without charge." Detectives quizzed the former leader for around seven hours.  Her arrest is the third in the probe that has sent shockwaves through Scotland's politics, long dominated by the SNP. Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the former chief executive of the SNP, was arrested in April as part of the probe. Party treasurer Colin Beattie was arrested the same month.  The brewing scandal has plunged the SNP into deep crisis and damaged its dream for an independent Scotland. Sturgeon stepped down as Scotland's first minister in February, saying that she lacked the "energy" to carry on. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Teenager killed, three wounded in Sweden shooting
Body: A 15-year-old boy was killed and three other people injured in a shooting in Stockholm on Saturday, police said, adding that a motive had yet to be established.   Police received reports of the shooting near a square in southern Stockholm in the early evening, and found two people with gunshot wounds at the scene. Another two were found injured nearby.   The teenager succumbed to his wounds while the others were taken to hospital. "The person who died at the scene is a boy aged 15," Towe Hagg, spokeswoman for Stockholm police, told AFP. Another 15-year-old boy was injured, as were a man and a woman aged between 45 and 65, police said in a statement. They added that two men had been arrested following a car chase south of Stockholm just under an hour after the shooting. Police said they had launched an investigation into murder and attempted murder.  On Friday, another three people were injured in two separate shootings in the wider Stockholm area. Sweden has struggled to rein in a surge of shootings and bombings in recent years, as gangs settle scores fuelled by the narcotics trade. The country registered 391 shootings in 2022, 62 of them fatal, up from 45 the previous year, according to police data.

Title: Police financial crimes unit assessing San Andrea School claims case
Body: The police financial crime unit is investigating the San Andrea School case, parents and staff were told on Saturday. During an information meeting, the school board informed them that the Financial Crime Investigations Department (FCID) had asked the school for a copy of an inquiry, led by retired judge David Scicluna and a report by audit firm PWC into claims of financial mismanagement. The Mġarr-based school, one of the biggest private schools in Malta, is collaborating with the FCID.  The inquiry and the audit report were two separate probes in allegations by the school’s assistant head, Trevor Templeman, who accused the school board’s former chairman, Kevin Spiteri, of having defrauded the school out of hundreds of thousands of euro. Templeman had claimed a member of staff was paid €25,000 to keep quiet about the issue and that the school reassigned him different duties using trumped-up cyberbullying charges. The judicial inquiry concluded that the payout was a severance pay package. Another key allegation was that Spiteri had taken €200,000 from school funds and that his company, KJM Enterprises, had made over €3 million for infrastructural projects. The judge leading the inquiry did not look into the alleged financial irregularities. A statement from the school appeared to confirm that Spiteri’s business received in excess of €3 million over eight years, covering costs linked to the multipurpose hall, employee wages and materials. Judge Scicluna’s 73-page report, commissioned by the school board, also pointed to a historically pervasive attitude of bullying and arrogance, and warned that “a school cannot be run as a fiefdom”. It also said there were various red flags over how the private school was managing its finances. The report was compiled after hearing the testimony of 65 witnesses and wading through numerous documents. It also made 30 recommendations to promote accountability and better governance at the school. The inquiry noted the clique-like nature of the relationship between Templeman, school head Stefania Bartolo, assistant head Ruth Azzopardi, and the past board chairman. Since the allegations first came to light last October, Templeman and Bartolo resigned, while assistant head Ruth Azzopardi remained suspended. The inquiry concluded that several claims made by Templeman were unsubstantiated but singled out school top management for failing to take disciplinary action in numerous situations. Sense of 'hope' at meeting When parents and staff packed the school hall on Saturday morning, they were given a briefing of what was done after Templeman’s claims were made public. There was a sense of hope in the hall, with parents urging the school’s administration to take on board the inquiry’s recommendations, address the problems flagged and move forward. Members of a Strategic Review Committee, a subcommittee of the school board, told the audience that the findings of the PWC report were part of phase one with the second phase being a full-scale financial investigation into the findings of the first phase, with full access granted to all the school’s data. The board had also drafted anti-bullying and whistleblower policies. The board wants to build a strong management team that will focus on communication and building trust, as the current board is involved in the day-to-day running of the school, the parents and staff were told. Journalists were not allowed into the meeting and Times of Malta relied on the accounts of parents who attended the meeting.  One parent asked about procurement and conflict of interest issues, ostensibly referring to the fact that the past board chairman gave his own company a contract of works. The board admitted there was no mechanism to address any conflicts, adding that a policy in this regard was needed to address the issue and mitigate the risks. For example, those forming part of the school’s projects sub-committee will not be allowed to submit a tender for a project.   Meanwhile, the chairperson of the San Andrea School board, Alexander Tortell, who had “stepped aside” when allegations of wrongdoing had been made public, has turned down an invitation to return to head the board, and instead resigned from the position, citing “personal reasons”. The school’s board of trustees this week wrote to Tortell, inviting him to return to the school in his previous position since the inquiry had exculpated him from any wrongdoing. He, however, replied that although he noted that he had been cleared, he was turning down the invitation to return to his post but was resigning from the position. Tortell had “stepped aside” for the duration of the internal inquiry probing claims of financial mismanagement that pre-date his term in office. "It is also important to make clear that all decisions taken during my term as chairman were taken with total transparency - the board was always involved and apprised and there are documents and minutes that attest to this,” he had told Times of Malta back then.

Title: Critics wary of 'toothless' EU ethics monitor plan
Body: The EU on Thursday proposed a new ethics monitor as it grapples with the fallout of a European Parliament graft scandal, but the plan was called insufficient by critics. The long-awaited push to improve standards among politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels has been in the pipelines since it was pitched by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in 2019.  But it won fresh urgency after a high-profile probe into European Parliament bribery allegations against Qatar and Morocco, which have denied any wrongdoing.   "Democracy in Europe can thrive only if people trust the institutions and such trust is not a given. We have to earn it," said EU values and transparency commissioner Vera Jourova.  She called for the plan to be implemented "as soon as possible" ahead of European parliamentary elections next June.  The new ethics body - which is expected to have just three employees - would be the first-ever covering the EU's main institutions, the European Council, commission and parliament.  The commission said binding "common standards for ethical conduct" will be set relating to the taking gifts and hospitality from third parties, declaring assets and side jobs.  But the proposal was savaged by EU lawmakers and activists for failing to give the body any investigative powers and the ability to punish wrongdoing.   The centrist Renew group in the parliament insisted it would not back the proposal for a "toothless ethics body".  The Greens called the plan "underwhelming, underpowered and uninspired".   "This proposal the Commission has put forward today is for a body that is not independent, will not have investigatory powers and will not be able to sanction breaches of ethics rules," said German MEP Daniel Freund. Gaby Bischoff, from the Socialists and Democrats group, called it a "a complete missed opportunity".  The clamour for tougher policing of EU officials and politicians comes in the wake of the so-called Qatargate scandal that has rattled faith in the bloc.  The probe into alleged influence peddling at the European Parliament exploded into the public domain when Belgian police arrested suspects and netted over €1.5 million in cash in December. It centres on accusations that Qatar and Morocco sought to buy off MEPs to tilt the parliament's discussions in their favour.   The two countries deny any involvement in wrongdoing, as do three socialist MEPs implicated by the Belgian authorities. Transparency International said the "watered-down" proposal "would not be able to clean up the mess left by Qatargate". "This proposed ethics body reinforces the EU's business-as-usual, self-policing approach to misconduct," the NGO's deputy director for Europe Nicholas Aiossa said.  "If the EU is to be serious about combatting corruption within its own ranks, it must ensure that any independent oversight body has the power and resources to investigate and sanction members engaged in wrongdoing."

Title: Ownership of van used in alleged abduction remains unknown
Body: The ownership of a van that was allegedly used for an abduction last year and later found near Birżebbuġa remains unknown, a court was told on Thursday. Christian Borg, Luke John Milton, Thorne Mangion, Burton Azzopardi, Tyson Grech and Jeremy Borg stand accused over their involvement in the abduction and all are pleading not guilty. During a previous sitting, the court heard how the alleged victim, Carlos Schembri, had spotted two vehicles, a blue Mercedes Sprinter and a white Renault Master, which he identified as those used by his abductors on that January 21 afternoon last year. He was allegedly bundled into the van but escaped when it stopped at a petrol station. Following his alleged ordeal, Schembri turned up at Paola police station reporting that he had been forced out of his car just outside his panel beater’s garage in Triq it-Tagħbija, Rabat, bundled into a white van and driven to Paola where he was then transferred to another van, the Mercedes Sprinter. All along the way, his abductors allegedly fired questions about his suspected involvement in vehicle thefts to the detriment of Borg and his company. The victim claimed he was punched and kicked by his abductors who took his phone and scrolled through its contents, threatening to chop off his finger and rape his sister. Schembri finally managed to slip away from the van when the gang pulled in at a Fgura service station to refuel.  RELATED STORIES  Some nine months after that alleged ordeal, Schembri spotted two vans in a Birżebbuġa field and alerted his mother who worked nearby, asking her to take photos of the vehicles and later join him at the Paola police station where he intended to report his finding. That was why on that October 29 morning, an officer from the Paola police station was dispatched to Triq Bengħajsa, Birżebbuġa where he was to keep watch over two vehicles parked inside a field. One of the vans had a dent on the front passenger side, testified the officer today. He was also instructed to inform Christian Borg who duly turned up, along with his associate Joseph Camenzuli. Both men were present while two officers from the Forensic Science Laboratory lifted samples from the vehicles which were then towed away to the police compound at Ta’ Kandja. The district officer was there between 6am and noon, leaving once the process had been completed and the vans removed. One of the forensic experts gave an overview of his work that day. A colleague had photographed the vehicles while he lifted samples for DNA and fingerprint testing purposes. Seven samples were taken from the Mercedes van along with a Heineken bottle found inside the driver’s door. Other samples were taken from the Renault vehicle. Attorney General lawyer Francesco Refalo requested the court to appoint fingerprint and DNA experts to carry out a comparative analysis with samples taken from the accused. Prosecuting inspector Roderick Attard pointed out that one of the vans was locked and since no key was available at the time of discovery, the vehicle had been sealed and remained so to date. Magistrate Monica Vella then asked the parties, including the accused and their lawyers, whether anyone knew who the vehicle belonged to. No one answered. “To date, ownership is still unknown,” said the AG lawyer. In another sitting in May a police officer said that Joe Camenzuli (a former Labour Party photographer and an associate of Christian Borg) had arrived on site in Birzebbuġa and said that the vans belonged to him. In light of such circumstances, the court authorised the same police forensic expert to unlock the van under supervision of Inspector Attard and in the presence of the accused and their lawyers, who were invited to attend while the unlocking process took place. Once the necessary samples are lifted from the vehicle the court would appoint other experts to carry out the comparative examination requested by the prosecution. The court also ordered Tyson Grech to be escorted under arrest to the next sitting, observing that not turning up today because he was “caught up at work” was not a valid excuse. Jeremy Borg was also absent because unwell. He was ordered to present a medical certificate to justify his absence. The case continues in July. Lawyers Giannella de Marco, Stephen Tonna Lowell, Gianluca Caruana Curran, Charles Mercieca, Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb, Stefano Filletti, Michael Sciriha, Roberto Spiteri and Jason Grima are variously assisting the accused. Lawyer Shaun Zammit appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Aġenzija Sapport vans vandalised
Body: Vans used by Aġenzija Sapport for services in the community were vandalised on Friday night, Oliver Scicluna, the Commissioner for the Rights of Persons with Disability, said in a post on Facebook. “The vans, which are suitable for wheelchair users, were last night vandalised by some coward,” Scicluna wrote.   He said it was a shame that clients and workers would have to suffer as a result but the agency will ensure that services will continue to be given. It will also file the necessary police reports, he said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: New York, a hub for illicit art trafficking
Body: From an ancient Middle Eastern limestone elephant to seventh-century Chinese sculptures, New York prosecutors have seized hundreds of priceless artefacts looted from around the globe that have earned it the reputation as a key global hub for art trafficking. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is among major institutions and collectors who have been forced to hand over works that the city has returned to more than a dozen countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. The scale of the seizures and repatriations “leaves no shadow of a doubt”, said Christos Tsirogiannis, a forensic archaeologist and art historian specialising in stolen artworks.   “New York is one of the world’s hub cities for the illicit trafficking of antiquities,” he told AFP.  Tsirogiannis of the University of Aarhus in Denmark, and David Gill, a professor at Britain’s Kent Law School, have been helping the Manhattan district attorney’s campaign to return stolen art to their country of origin. Since 2017, prosecutors have repatriated pieces that were looted from around 20 countries between the 1970s and 1990s. They have included works from ancient Greece, the Roman and Byzantine empires, Iraq, China, India and Southeast Asia. Collectors The pace has quickened in the last two years. Under Alvin Bragg, who became district attorney in January 2022, more than 950 pieces worth $165 million have been returned to several countries including Cambodia, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey and Italy.   At a ceremony at the Chinese consulate in New York last month, Bragg handed back to Beijing two seventh-century stone sculptures valued at $3.5 million. The works had been sawn from tombs in the 1990s, exported and then sold illegally. Well-known Manhattan-based collector Shelby White loaned them to the Met from 1998 until their seizure this year, Bragg’s office said. White, 85, is a billionaire philanthropist and Met trustee. Her home was subject to searches by Bragg’s team in June 2021 and April 2022. Bragg announced last that month 89 works with a total value of $69 million had been seized from White, who prosecutors do not accuse of wrongdoing. He thanked her “for her cooperation”.   Art Newspaper reported in December that White had returned pieces to Italy and Turkey, with the businesswoman telling the website: “I really don’t have anything to say.” AFP has not been able to contact her. Tsirogiannis and Gill believe that White’s acquisitions made with her late husband Leon Levy “may have been unwise”, especially those amassed after the 1970 UNESCO Convention to prevent the illicit trafficking of cultural property. Tsirogiannis points out that White returned 10 works to Italy and two to Greece prior to 2008.   “So she should definitely have at least (had) serious doubts on the origin and the status of the rest and should have checked them all these years before the recent confiscations that took place,” he said. Gill cited White’s only known public statement on the issue in an interview she gave in 2007 when she said: “If you go to Sotheby’s or Christie’s and buy something at a public auction, you don’t think you are doing anything inappropriate.” The most recent restitution took place on May 19, when prosecutors returned to Iraq a limestone elephant and an alabaster bull from the Sumerian civilisation “stolen during the Gulf War and smuggled into New York in the late 1990s”. The bull was found in Shelby’s private collection and Bragg pledged he will not allow New York to be “safe harbour for stolen cultural artifacts”. Louvre Other art dealers have been forced to return works. Collector Michael Steinhardt, who had a room named after him at the Met, handed back 180 antiquities worth $70 million following an out-of-court settlement in 2021. Manhattan-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor was sentenced to 10 years in prison in India in November following a decade-long international investigation.   In September, Bragg returned 16 pieces to Egypt, including five seized from the Met, as part of a twin investigation between New York and Paris authorities in which the former president of the Louvre, Jean-Luc Martinez, was charged. Martinez denies ignoring warnings about false certificates that faked the origin of the works. Without commenting on the case, Louvre president Laurence des Cars told AFP during a visit to New York in May that “major museums should know the history of their collections” and that “the history of the Met’s collections was not that of the Louvre”. Last month, the Met announced it would examine the provenance of “several hundred or more” objects that were possibly stolen from their country of origin, and then return them where necessary.

Title: Mexico police find 45 bags with human body parts in ravine
Body: At least 45 bags with human remains were found in a ravine in the western Mexican state of Jalisco during a search for seven young people reported missing last week, local authorities said.  "Forty-five bags with human remains have been extracted that belong to both male and female people," the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.  The gruesome discovery was made on Tuesday at the bottom of a 40-meter ravine in the municipality of Zapopan, a suburb of Guadalajara, a large industrial hub.  The authorities had launched a search for two women and five men, all aged around 30 years, who had been reported missing since May 20.  The missing persons' reports for each one had been made separately on different days, but investigators found that they all worked at the same call centre. The call centre was in the same area where the human remains were discovered.  Forensic experts have yet to determine the number of victims and their identities. Initial inquiries suggested the call centre could have been involved in illegal activities, and local media reported that the authorities had found marijuana, a cloth and a cleaning rag with apparent blood stains as well as documents on possible commercial activities. But relatives of the missing accused the authorities of seeking to criminalize the victims.  In recent years, in different areas of Jalisco, human remains have been found in bags or in unmarked makeshift graves.  In 2021, in the municipality of Tonala, in Jalisco, some 70 bags with the human remains of 11 people were found.  And in 2019, the bodies of 29 people were found in 119 bags in an unpopulated area of Zapopan. Another case that sparked numerous protests in Jalisco was the disappearance, in March 2018, of three film students, whose remains were dissolved in acid.  Also in 2018, media reported that three Italians disappeared, allegedly handed over by police to the Jalisco New Generation cartel, to whom they had allegedly sold faulty machinery.  The Italians have not been found despite massive searches by state and federal law enforcement.  According to local media, in the first two months of this year alone, the remains of 33 people were found in five makeshift graves in the Guadalajara area.  The Jalisco New Generation cartel operates in the state and is one of the most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, and is embroiled in disputes with other drug syndicates. Mexico has recorded more than 340,000 murders and some 100,000 disappearances, the majority attributed to criminal organizations, since the launch of a controversial military anti-drug offensive in December 2006.

Title: ‘That ‘70s Show’ actor Masterson found guilty of rape
Body: US actor and Scientologist Danny Masterson on Wednesday was found guilty of raping two women at his home in the Hollywood Hills. The star of television’s That ‘70s Show and The Ranch was convicted of two counts of forcible rape between 2001 and 2003, while jurors at a Los Angeles courthouse said they were deadlocked on a third rape charge. It was the second rape trial for Masterson, after previous proceedings were declared a mistrial last November when a different jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision.  Masterson was taken into custody following the verdict and is awaiting sentencing. He could face 30 years to life in prison. The actor, now 47, rose to fame with the 1998 launch of retro sitcom That ‘70s Show, where he played the character of Steven Hyde alongside fellow stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.  He co-starred again with Kutcher on Netflix’s The Ranch, but was fired in 2017 and written off the show after Los Angeles police confirmed they were investigating multiple rape allegations against the actor.   Prosecutors at the time dropped two further sexual assault cases against Masterson over lack of evidence and the statute of limitations passing. During closing arguments earlier this month, prosecutors said Masterson “drugged and raped each one of these victims” and called on the jury to hold him “accountable for what he has done”.   The three alleged victims were also members of the Church of Scientology at the time, and Masterson met them through the secretive group. Two of them said church officials had discouraged them from contacting law enforcement. Masterson’s lawyers in his closing argument questioned why the court had heard “so much about Scientology”, and the defence has suggested that bias against the Church could have been a motivating factor. The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to AFP request for comment. The jury deliberated for around seven days. The third rape charge, on which no verdict was reached, involved a former longtime girlfriend of Masterson. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Watch: Knives, tools and cars used in street fight in front of children
Body: A street fight involving at least eight people, two cars and multiple weapons broke out in Santa Venera in front of two young children on Tuesday night.  The brawl happened at around 10.30pm along a stretch of Cannon Road and was caught on camera. Dramatic footage obtained by Times of Malta shows a car that appears to attempt to run over people on the street and later rams into another vehicle.  At least one knife and what appears to be a wrench are used in the fight in the residential street.   Residents living in the area say there are regular fights and disturbances.  "A street brawl breaks out around two times a month around here," one resident said.  Another added: "We are becoming increasingly uncomfortable in our own homes at night." According to the footage, the fight began at around 10.35pm when a Volkswagen drove down Canon Road towards Ħamrun, watched by a man on a pavement, holding what appears to be a wrench.   The car stopped by the side of the road, the driver came out and an altercation broke out on the road between the two men and a third passenger.  The fight appeared to break up a few seconds later as the driver returned to the car. But at that moment, two other men came running out of a building, one of whom appears to have been holding a long knife.   The other man initially came out of the building empty-handed but returned with a long weapon and both of them ran towards the car.   At this stage, the driver fled in his car. He continued driving towards Ħamrun but stopped where the street is closed for road works, turned around and accelerated towards the group, swerving towards them, as if to run them over. The men in the street ran to catch up with him and begin hitting the car and  opening the door as the driver attempts to drive away.  That is when a second car - a Honda - appeared on the scene. Another man jumped out of the passenger window of the moving Honda and attempts to join the fight, but the Volkwagen reversed and rammed the front of the Honda pushing it further backward.   As the Volkswagen reversed onto the Honda, the men on the street surrounded the Volkswagen and continue to kick it, hitting it with long objects and opening its doors and slamming them shut multiple times. As all of this is happening, a woman and two very young children come out of the building - out of the same door from which the two men had emerged with weapons earlier.   One of the children - a girl - clings on to the clothes of the woman as she looks on at the fight. The other toddler - a boy - comes out of the door appearing to mimic the fighting men.  The Volkswagen then flees the scene and the men on the street walk around the Honda to inspect the damages before everything calms down and everyone walks away. Police arrived on site around five minutes later but they found nobody on the street. They walked around with torches and inspect the area before they left. The police confirmed they received a report on the incident on Tuesday evening and said they immediately opened an investigation.  “The police immediately went on site and started to investigate. The investigations are still ongoing,” a spokesperson said.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Register for people guilty of abusing disabled persons to be introduced
Body: All establishments that house disabled residents will soon have to screen prospective employees to check if they are on a register for people found guilty of abusing disabled persons.  The register was announced by Inclusion Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli in Parliament on Tuesday evening.  She said that, a few weeks ago, Cabinet approved the introduction of a public register listing people who have been found guilty by the courts of abusing disabled persons.   The register would be similar to that for sex offenders, which organisations that deal with children are obliged to consult before employing someone. A public consultation exercise on the register and other legislation to protect disabled people will be announced in the following weeks, the minister added.  She noted that the police are investigating two carers at Dar L-Arka in Gozo, for allegedly abusing a disabled resident.  The two carers have been suspended from the home.  “No abuse, on anyone, is acceptable, and the same counts for abuse on disabled people,” she said in Parliament.  “This means that every home for the disabled, whether State-run, operated by NGOs or the private sector, will be obliged to check whether a prospective employee is on this register,” she said. Farrugia Portelli said it “makes no sense” for the court to find someone guilty of abusing a disabled person, and for them to be removed from their place of employment, only to move to another institution in the sector. She said some disabled persons were non-verbal, and, therefore, unable to speak out if they were abused.  “Others may be unaware that they are being abused, and this is why we have to send a strong message against these vile acts.” Farrugia Portelli said she believes the majority of carers are responsible people, and thanked them for all they do to take care of persons with a disability. “Their job is not a walk in the park, they come across cases and situations which are challenging… and the introduction of this register will close some of the gaps in the system and serve as a deterrent for those who earn a living from this sector,” she said.  "The most important value is that we continue to protect those persons with a disability." Farrugia Portelli also suggested that now is the time for government-run homes for the disabled to introduce CCTV cameras in common areas and not just in halls.  “As a government, we should be focused on going in this direction, and we have already begun to instal such cameras in the centres of Aġenzija Sapport. The same process has begun in the homes run by the agency,” she said.  She said the Social Care Standards Authority, which regulates the sector, is also reviewing its policies when it comes to installing CCTV cameras.

Title: ‘They just ignored my tears, they ignored my unhappiness’
Body: Any thoughts of escaping to a more natural life was regarded as being sinful. The idea of being unfaithful to your vocation was a step on the way to hell. It would be a mortal sin. These are the words of Mary, my mother. She was just 15 when she entered a convent in Ireland in 1950 and 34 by the time she finally managed to leave. She had been expressing doubts to her superiors since her early twenties but years of “brainwashing” and the very real fear of her and her family facing eternal damnation made breaking her vows seem impossible. Speaking to my mother, as well as to five other nuns and former nuns for my PhD research, gave me a glimpse into a way of life which no longer exists. Their often heartbreaking narratives paint a picture of a repressive and damaging regime which emphasised self-sacrifice and unquestioning obedience and where suffering and “breaking the spirit” supposedly brought you closer to heaven. For many who left the convent, the years of “grooming”, “mind control” and “infantilisation” made adjusting to secular life a significant challenge – mentally, socially, emotionally and financially. Few were supported in this transition. This article is part of Conversation InsightsThe Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges. The image of the “evil nun” has become almost a caricature in recent years, particularly in Ireland, where the fallout from decades of abuse scandals has left a deep scar, radically changing perceptions of the Catholic church. These women’s stories offer an insider’s perspective of life within the convent walls and hopefully provide a more nuanced view of just what it was like to wear the habit and then, eventually, to cast it aside. The women I spoke to were just children when they entered the convent, with hopes of making a better life for themselves but without any real understanding of what lay in store. Instead, they were manipulated and brainwashed. One woman was sexually abused by an older priest at the age of 15, while another had a mental breakdown and went on hunger strike in a cry for help which was ignored. No study currently exists which specifically explores the testimonies of former “women religious” (both nuns and sisters) in Ireland, particularly those who entered religious life before the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Instigated by Pope John XXIII and with an emphasis on aggiornamento (updating or modernisation), the Second Vatican Council was characterised by a spirit of renewal and self-reflection. The winds of change blowing from Rome ushered in a raft of seismic transformations throughout the Catholic church. For example, following Vatican II, mass was no longer given in Latin but in the vernacular, and the position of the altar was turned around so that priests didn’t have their backs to “the people of God” as they delivered Mass. Following Vatican II, nuns gradually enjoyed more autonomy. For example, they could take more personal responsibility in decision making, they were allowed to cultivate friendships within and beyond the convent, and they could learn to drive (something that they had previously been unable to do). Before Vatican II convent hierarchies were much more rigid. An individual nun had to surrender her will to her superior and was no longer in control of her destiny. A number of the women in my study (who, apart from my mother, I will not be identifying or using real names for) said that their lives and duties could vary significantly depending on whoever held that office. An unquestioning acceptance was expected and the emphasis was on self-sacrifice, renunciation of the self and conforming to life in community. The six women I’m working with entered a religious congregation in Ireland in the 1950s, when they were between 13 and 16. They grew up in different convents and worked as sisters and teachers in various schools in Ireland, England and East Asia. Four spent between 15 and 27 years in religious life before leaving and two remained. They are all now in their eighties. I felt very strongly that their stories needed to be captured before they were lost because, within the patriarchal Catholic church, an “archaeology of exclusion” has rendered nuns almost invisible in the historical record.   The voices of former nuns are afforded even less space. Religious women formed the largest and most powerful group of professional women in Ireland for much of the 20th century. And yet congregations of teaching sisters in Ireland have been in decline since the late 1960s. My investigation into these hidden lives began with my mother. Now well into her eighties, she still has a recurrent nightmare of not being able to escape the convent: I’ve had for years the dream, the nightmare, of travelling through high grass with a bicycle. I’m in the wrong place - should be out on the road … Or I’m climbing over a wall, trying to get down and finding it difficult. Certainly, it was years of this thing in your head all the time, you know, you shouldn’t be here but I’m here. What can I do? You were told there was a light shining down on top of you from heaven and you were picked, you were chosen. Really, a stupid kind of way of describing a vocation. I cannot remember when I first learned that my mother was a nun for almost two decades. My relationship to this aspect of her life story has evolved considerably. As a child, I think I adopted a position of active not knowing, feeling that my mother’s status as a former nun was somehow shameful and made us different in small town Catholic Ireland where I grew up. A “spoilt nun” or a “spoilt priest” was the description for those who left their vocation (often described as the “call” to religious life). There was a stigma attached to such transgressions. Some of the women in my study kept this part of their past secret to all but close family. One woman avoided telling her children about her former identity until they were adults. As a teenager, I remember feeling a burning sense of injustice on my mother’s behalf and was horrified at the idea of her confinement. She had consistently expressed doubts about her vocation, believing herself to be unsuited to life as a sister. How could her superiors turn a blind eye to her repeated requests to leave? At 15, the age my mother entered the convent, I prized my growing independence and found the idea of complete submission and erasure of self incomprehensible. As I grew older, I moved on to a deeper understanding of her former identity but still felt protective of her and was resistant to talking about it, in case she became an object of curiosity. But when it comes to families, all our stories get tangled up. My mother’s story is a part of my story. My own daughter is now 15, and it brings home to me the vulnerability of “being groomed”, as one of the women describes her experience of entering the convent. While it is undoubtedly the case that some young women believed that they had a vocation and were answering “the call” from God, becoming a nun afforded opportunities for women in Ireland at a time when they were not visible in public life. The surge in vocations in Ireland continued until 1967 and can be attributed to a desire for education, professional opportunities, economic stability or a life of adventure as a missionary. Having a nun or priest in the family boosted a family’s social capital. Religious life conferred a privileged identity within a powerful, transnational institution. The attraction to religious life could also be interpreted as a sign of women actively seeking an alternative to marriage and motherhood rather than a reaction to a lack of eligible bachelors. In the case of the women in my study, given that they were children when they entered (between 13 and 16) it is safe to assume they were not left “on the shelf”. Canvassing by religious orders was common at that time as “getting vocations” was key to an institute’s growth and success. The Catholic church was akin to an empire, a transnational institution whose reach and governance extended far beyond national borders. Nuns representing various Irish and international orders visited schools and sometimes local farms with large families as part of their recruitment drive, often showing alluring films of life on the missions. In the Ireland of the 1950s (and indeed until the demise of the Catholic church in the 1990s), priests and nuns enjoyed positions of power and privilege in Irish society and adopting a deferential, unquestioning acceptance of religion was expected. Ireland was, therefore, an important recruitment channel for young postulants (the title given at the first stage of entry into a congregation). My mother remembers the nuns’ visit to her secondary school. She was 14 and beginning to think about where she might go as emigration was inevitable for so many people in rural Ireland at that time. She recalls being impressed by this nun who came from Italy, thinking that perhaps she had links with the pope. My mother said: “She told us romantic stories about going to the missions, Africa in particular. I distinctly remember her showing us a photograph of a lovely nun dressed in white in a boat going down some river in Africa and having children with her and she was in charge of things. So immediately I thought, ‘Well that’s where I’m going then because I have to go somewhere and that sounds wonderful’.” My aunt also joined, at 13. My mother remembers that my aunt’s legs did not reach the floor when she sat on her chair because she was so very young. While my mother was seduced by visions of a luminous missionary and informed by the wider economic context of needing to “go somewhere”, there were other, more personal, reasons for joining too. One woman I spoke to, who I am calling Louise, spent 16 years as a nun before leaving at the age of 32. For her, joining was about family dynamics and a difficult relationship with her mother. She said: Really I want to be sincere about this, when I decided to enter … it wasn’t that I wanted to be a nun as such or that I wanted to look after the poor or that I wanted to go to the missions. It really was to prove to my mum particularly that I was a good person. I remember thinking, if I do this they will know I am good. That was very important to me at the time. Christina, who spent 27 years in the convent, attributes her entry to what she describes as “an illegitimate relationship” with a “predatory priest”. She was just 15. Now 88, but with an energy that belies her years, she told me: I knew that it was inappropriate … But I thought it was a privilege at the time. I did. He was very versed in various things and French, he spoke French, you know, that sort of thing. I thought it was … on the surface and personally, I thought it was an honour. She remembers when a particular order came to her school and made joining sound so “fashionable and delightful” that she thought, why not? All of the women took simple vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Contact with the outside world was ruptured, letters in and out were read by their superiors. Convent life worked to erase a sense of individual identity through adherence to strict rules. My mother said you were “not to speak about any part of your body and not to speak about your health in general and not to speak about … well, not to speak to anyone, it’s better not to”. The women were forbidden from forming special friendships (“that was a big thing”). You were not to “talk your heart out to anyone”. You knew you shouldn’t say, ‘I’m very lonely. I wish I could go home’. That would be rather sinful to say a thing like that to one of your co-mates. So you were to be always in good humour, always smiling, always, you know, very respectful towards everybody and again on the surface … You were really dumbed down in the sense of not being able to talk much, not to talk about your ‘life in the world’ as they used to call it. So it was definitely a brainwashing thing … For my mother, who had been thriving at school, it was a shock to discover that the promise of a scholarship did not materialise. On entering she discovered that the order had in fact no secondary school and the new recruits were expected to progress to their final state examinations through self-study, a correspondence course and occasional evening input from the nuns in the primary school. We were sitting on butter boxes, upturned butter boxes, because they obviously found it hard to accommodate that number of us – we must have been 30 at least – and we had other butter boxes in which we had our belongings and we were all crowded into a very big dormitory in a house that was originally a factory. So therefore, it was spartan, the whole idea, the whole thing. The food was regular, but very poor quality … And now when I look back at that, we were just herded in there as if we all had a vocation.  What was a vocation, you know, at that age? You just knew nothing about it. Louise found the lack of stimulation stultifying. She told me: As there was no conversation with each other there was no way of enlightening each other in any way about life. We were totally sensory deprived, that was it. We never listened to music, we weren’t allowed to read books, we never saw a paper, we were never allowed to listen to the radio, so that we were totally cut off from the ‘outside world’, as they would call it. The ‘outside world’, which of course was full of evil anyway. Louise said that once she regained her freedom she remembered the thrill of being able to buy and read books. Her house reflects this love of reading and I was struck by how articulate and methodical she was when describing her experience, even when speaking about the mental ill health she still suffers from decades later. The legacy of such social conditioning is not easy to cast off. Christina, who entered the convent at 16 and left at 43, also lamented the censorship of reading materials which she believed stunted their development. She said: “We were still treated like children. We always had to be assisted, watched. There was always somebody watching us … And we had no books, no stimulation, so we were non-entities.” But if you wanted to leave, it was far from straightforward. On expressing doubts to a superior about their vocation the women might be told it was the devil tempting them, or that if they left they would be damned, or that through their “higher calling”, as one of the women put it, “one’s relations down to the third generation would achieve salvation through our fidelity”. Or that they would never be able to pay back the congregation for what they had been given. And they would submit and stay on. Christina, who had confessed her relationship with the priest, was told if she left the convent she “would be in hell for all eternity”. “Who wanted to be in hell for all eternity? You know, the pictures we saw of hell in those days were terrible. I don’t even believe in hell now”, she added. For Louise, the strain caused her to develop OCD and, in her late twenties, she had, in her words, a nervous breakdown. Following a period in hospital she said of her reluctant return to the convent: They just ignored my tears, they ignored my unhappiness. Then I decided I’d go on hunger strike and I didn’t know what hunger strike was but that’s what I did … I mean, that wasn’t in my nature. That sort of rebellion wasn’t in my nature and that went on for quite a while. But do you know something? I’ve often looked back on that and I’ve thought, how inhumane they were. They would let somebody who was so unhappy … and ignore their distress, totally ignore their distress.“ Throughout her twenties and early thirties my mother’s desire to leave grew stronger and she dreamed of having a family. She recalls the longing she felt observing a scene of domesticity from her attic dormitory: "I used to look through a porthole, an attic window, as I was preparing to go into bed. I used to see a housewife or mother of a family, getting on about her, coming out to the clothesline was one of the things I noticed especially. And then the door of her kitchen would have been open and you’d see the lights inside and you’d get hints of family life.” She added: In my own mind I compared that to the lonely bed I had to lie on from half past nine that night. And you would wonder why you couldn’t have that – a life full of warmth - and what misfortune you had to have a vocation when a family life was all you wanted. And any inclination you mentioned towards that was regarded as a temptation by the devil to spoil your vocation. Any thoughts of escaping to a more natural life was regarded as being sinful. The idea of being unfaithful to your vocation was a step on the way to hell. It would be a mortal sin. A teachers strike in 1969 provided a pause in a gruelling routine, allowing her time and space to think. By this time, she was 34 and the headteacher of a secondary school. The responsibility was empowering. She had begun to think for herself: It was the first time in my life I could make a decision. Because I had come in too young and had been told what to do always, told what to think, what not to think and all that and I suddenly decided ‘I am advising everybody and I’m telling everyone what we’ll do. Now why can’t I tell myself what to do?’ And during that strike I made up my mind that, no matter what, I’m going. So I went up and I told the superior at that time, who was a nicer person, a very kindly person, and I said I’ve been talking like this for years. And now I’m not asking for advice anymore, I’m just telling you that I must leave. In the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council there was an exodus as many nuns worldwide left their congregations and returned to the world as lay people. Karen Armstrong has written extensively of her own “climb out of darkness”, documenting her departure from convent life in a series of memoirs. Many left with nothing and were ill prepared for life after. Research has drawn attention to this “paradox of service”, that there was little or no acknowledgement of the enormity of former nuns’ unpaid contributions, as teachers, as nurses or in other ministry, in the form of practical or financial support. The authoritarian and repressive aspects of convent life in the pre-Vatican II era have been linked to emotional deprivation, social isolation and psychological problems. Louise spoke of her humiliation of leaving with nothing but her crucifix and still wearing her nun’s habit. She still feels bitter about the lack of care for her welfare. She said: I knew I would never, never, never come back. Not only did I never go back but I never contacted them after I left, never and they never contacted me, not once to say how are you doing? Are you coping? Now I was 32, I had entered at 16 and … in terms of life’s experiences I was still 16. I had never handled money, I had never had to make a decision, I had never lived and taken care of myself. My mother jokes about feeling self-conscious wearing miniskirts, which were in fashion when she left in 1969, because her many years of praying had left rough patches of skin on her knees. Others spoke of the social awkwardness of not knowing who The Beatles were and of hair loss following decades of wearing a veil. Their leaving also had an impact on those who stayed. As communication was discouraged, they could not tell other sisters that they were leaving. According to one sister who remained: … When they decided to leave, they were told not to tell anyone. So they never told us, they just disappeared, you know, and I think that was awful. “The bottom fell out of my world”, was how another nun described hearing the news of a fellow sister’s return to secular life. Nuns occupy a contentious place within Irish collective memory. ‘Are nuns human?’, the title of a two-part documentary made for Irish television in 1971, reveals perhaps a longstanding ambivalence about the image of women religious. Nuns were responsible for historical injustices, colluding in oppressive narratives orchestrated by the dyad of church and state. This is apparent from inquiries into the Magdalen Laundries and the “mother and baby homes”. The Clann Report, published in 2018, showed how the legacy of such abuse reverberated beyond Ireland, revealing that from the 1940s until the 1970s, in excess of 2,000 children were sent from Ireland to the US for adoption. This international adoption scheme was depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Philomena. The Clann Report raises the question of possible falsification of children’s deaths in institutions run by nuns to facilitate illegal adoptions. Yet, this is not the full story. Nuns also played a key role in advancing female education as well as social care. Portrayals of nuns as evil caricatures risk simplifying representations of the past, enabling state and society to absolve themselves of their part in Ireland’s “architecture of containment” and the “politics of shame”. Responding to the Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in 2021, then Taoiseach Micheál Martin noted how the state and society embraced a perverse religious morality and control, judgmentalism and moral certainty and issued an apology to the survivors of mother and baby homes. The nature of historical abuse crimes linked to the Catholic church is also a global phenomenon that has become increasingly complex. But, according to Cardinal João Braz de Aviz,  nuns have also suffered abuse within their own congregationsand the sexual abuse of nuns by the clergy has even been acknowledged by the pope. Meanwhile, Vatican guidelines published in 2017 recognised abuse of power within women’s institutes. My own research highlights the contrast which existed between the positions of power and privilege held by the religious orders in Irish society on the one hand and the hidden, self-sacrificing and often powerless life of the individual nun on the other. The church’s position today is far less secure than it was in the 1950s. Yet while institutional observance, as well as the proportion and total number of Catholics in the Irish population continues to fall (details of the 2016 census show that Catholics comprise 78.3% of the population compared with 84.2% five years previously), it would seem that Catholicism remains coupled with Irish identity for over three quarters of the population. Many convents – once a dominant symbol of faith and authority in Irish towns and cities – lie derelict or are undergoing redevelopment. The ageing population of nuns tend to live in small groups in houses located within their local community. Unlike the other women in the study who have eschewed any links with their previous life, my mother has been back in touch with some sisters from her former congregation in recent years. Reflecting on her former identity, she said: Whereas I’m not bitter, at the same time I’ve come to the conclusion that it was all really badly done and that many people were harmed and that those of us who were educated had something to fall back on when we left, but others hadn’t and were completely out of step with their age group and experienced an inability to find a job and to find a partner because they were older. Perhaps it helped that she met my father, started a family and created the more “natural life” that she imagined for herself looking out from her attic window.

Title: Police investigate two carers for abuse of disabled resident at Gozo care home
Body: Updated 6.10pm, adds Dar Arka statement Police are investigating reports that two carers at Dar L-Arka in Gozo abused a disabled resident in the church-run home. The carers have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, the ministry for inclusion said in a statement on Wednesday. Dar Arka confirmed the reports in a statement later saying the allegations are of physical abuse and they involve one resident with a disability at the home. It said that it had suspended the workers and reported them to Aġenzija Sapport, the Social Care Standards Authority and the police. Dar Arka also said that the Gozo diocese had appointed a board of discipline for the necessary steps to be taken. The case had also been reported to the Safeguarding Commission of the diocese. The ministry had said earlier that the agency and the authority had received confidential reports in the past days on the alleged abuse by the two carers. Dar Arka is a respite centre in Għajnsielem, run by Arka Foundation, which is a church-run, voluntary, non-governmental organisation that houses people with disabilities and promotes their welfare.  The centre, which was opened 25 years ago, also offers a wide range of services to people with special needs and their families, including a respite service. The government said in its statement that the authority had reported the alleged abuse to the police, who are investigating. The authority also launched its own internal investigation into the claims.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Car sprayer charged with selling vehicle he was meant to repair
Body: A car sprayer was on Monday charged with selling a vehicle that was entrusted to him to repair.  Charles Abela, 44, from Mellieħa, pleaded not guilty to misappropriating the car and defrauding its owner as well as the new buyer.  Police Inspector Ian Vella told Magistrate Rachel Montebello how the police received a report from the owner of the car that his car had been sold by the man who was meant to be repairing it.  Defence counsel Josette Sultana requested bail for her client but the prosecution objected, saying this is not the first time he had done it. The inspector said there were at least another three convictions of fraud so he clearly could not be trusted.  Magistrate Montebello granted Abela bail against a €2,500 deposit and a €3,000 personal guarantee. He was also ordered not to speak to witnesses in the case and sign the bail book three times a week.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man denied bail as Italian authorities seek extradition
Body: A man has been denied bail and remanded in custody as Italian authorities seek his extradition to serve a prison sentence after he was found guilty of charges related to document forgery and trafficking.  Tunisian national Ben Ali Hatem Samara, 51, was arraigned in front of magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo. The police presented evidence that he was a wanted man in Italy, asking the court to comply with a European arrest warrant and consent to Hatem Samara’s extradition to Italy.  Police Inspector Roderick Spiteri presented documents that included pictures and fingerprints of the accused that the Italian authorities sent to Maltese police.  A report from the forensic unit confirmed that the man’s fingerprints taken in Malta matched those sent over from Italy, Spiteri said.  The accused confirmed he knew why he was wanted by the Italian authorities. However, when asked by the court to confirm his name and personal details, he refused to answer, exercising his right to silence.  He further told the court that he did not give his consent to be extradited to Italy.  Legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia made a request for bail, saying that Samara is gainfully employed in Malta, has a fixed residence and holds bank accounts that tie him to the country.  The prosecution objected. “The crimes he was found guilty of are extraditable offences and it seems that he has already absconded from Italy,” Spiteri said.  “Had he committed the same things in Malta they would have also been very serious crimes and given the gravity of this we must strongly object to bail.”  The court denied bail. The case is set to be heard on May 23. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Man jailed after admitting to stealing phone from airport saleswoman
Body: A man who told court he could not believe his eyes when confronted with footage that showed him stealing a phone from an airport store was handed a 12-month jail term and placed under a treatment order. The theft took place at the Malta International Airport when a saleswoman reported that her Samsung phone had allegedly been stolen at around 8.30pm.  She had placed it behind the cash register. Since the whole area of the airport is closely monitored by security cameras, police soon tracked down the suspect.  Footage showed a man, wearing jeans and a black hoodie, stepping off a bus, entering the airport building and heading to the store. He first browsed through the store, stopping in front of some shelves before approaching the cash desk.  He picked up a book and opened it, pretending to read but then stretched out one arm, picked up the mobile phone and headed straightaway back to the bus stop, explained prosecuting Inspector Roxanne Tabone during the suspect’s arraignment today.  Police had obtained a still image from that footage and placed the man on the wanted list.  He was tracked down in Marsa.  The man, Khalleefah Ahmed Alhaaj Aljeel Aljamie, a 39-year-old Libyan national, had mental health issues which appeared to be made worse by mixing medication with alcohol.  After consulting his legal aid lawyer, the man, who is currently unemployed, admitted to the solitary charge of theft aggravated by the value of the item stolen.  He was also a recidivist.  Magistrate Victor George Axiak asked about the stolen phone.  “I was not conscious. I don’t remember anything. I could not believe it when I saw the video. I admit I’m guilty... I’ve been through trauma… When I take pills and drink, it’s like wires get loose,” the accused tried to explain.  As for the mobile, he had no idea.  “I don’t remember that part.”  When making submissions on punishment, the prosecutor said that the facts were clear enough. Although the law did not allow the court to apply a minimum punishment in light of the accused’s record, the man cooperated and needed treatment.  Defence lawyer Yanika Bugeja agreed with the prosecution that the accused needed help to reform, and treatment, requesting the court to advise his detention officers at Mount Carmel Hospital where he could receive help.  Upon the accused’s admission, the court condemned him to a 12-month effective jail term, coupled with a three-year treatment order and a three-year restraining order banning him from approaching the victim.  The court further ordered the man to compensate the victim €659 - the value of the stolen phone.  Inspector Roxanne Tabone prosecuted.  Lawyer Yanika Bugeja was legal aid counsel.

Title: Deutsche Bank to pay €69 million in Epstein victim settlement
Body: Deutsche Bank will pay $75 million  (€69 million) to settle litigation alleging the German lender financially benefited from supporting Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme, according to a report Wednesday. The settlement concerns an unnamed defendant who launched a proposed class-action suit in November 2022, alleging Deutsche Bank did business with Epstein while knowing he used funds in the account to support sex-trafficking activity, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday. The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said Deutsche Bank did not admit wrongdoing. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined comment. Deutsche Bank benefited financially by supporting Epstein's "sex trafficking organization to successfully rape, sexually assault and coercively sex traffic Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 and the numerous other members of the Class," said the original complaint, which was filed in US court in New York. Epstein, an American financier who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex crimes, began banking with Deutsche Bank in 2013 after JPMorgan Chase closed his accounts, the Journal reported. An unidentified woman - apparently the same as in the Deutsche case - and the US Virgin Islands brought separate suits against JPMorgan late last year, accusing the bank of facilitating Epstein's crimes by ignoring warnings and continuing to keep him as a client until 2013. According to court documents, subpoenas in those cases have targeted multiple well-known people whom Epstein possibly referred to JPMorgan as clients, including Elon Musk and Google co-founder Larry Page. The bank has denied the allegations, and has filed its own suit against a former executive for his ties to Epstein. Deutsche Bank in July 2020 agreed to pay $150 million (€138 million) to settle allegations brought by the New York Department of Financial Services for compliance failures connected to the bank's work for Epstein. "We acknowledge our error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes, and have learnt from our mistakes and shortcomings," Deutsche Bank said in July 2020. Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages, but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal. Later facing charges of trafficking underage girls for sex, he killed himself in a New York jail in August 2019. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Vince Muscat: judge misquoted my lawyers in Darren Debono HSBC case
Body: Vincent Muscat il-Koħħu is claiming that his fundamental rights were breached in proceedings where a judge has authorized his former co-accused Darren Debono, to testify against him over his alleged involvement in the 2010 HSBC attempted armed robbery. By means of a constitutional application filed on the eve of another hearing where Debono is scheduled to take the witness stand, Muscat’s lawyers have set up a fresh challenge, claiming that his fundamental rights have been breached in more ways than one. The whole issue originated from a last-minute admission by Debono on the eve when he was set to face trial alongside Muscat over the botched robbery. That admission, following a plea deal with the Attorney General, changed Debono’s position from co-accused to prime witness for the prosecution who immediately requested his name to be added to the list of witnesses. The move was objected to by Muscat’s defence. But the case was sent to the Magistrates’ Court for Debono’s testimony to be compiled and the records sent back to the Criminal Court for trial. However, matters took a complex twist when Debono declared, the minute he stepped onto the witness stand, that he would only testify against Muscat without mentioning any third parties, explaining that he feared for his own safety and that of his family. That surprise statement ultimately led to Debono’s prosecution for refusing to testify, earning him a six-month effective jail term and a €4600 fine. That punishment was subsequently halved on appeal over a legal technicality. Faced with a second request by the AG to have Debono added as a witness, Muscat’s lawyers raised fresh arguments, insisting that since Debono was reluctant to tell the whole truth he could not be administered the oath and was therefore not a competent witness. But Madam Justice Edwina Grima, presiding over the upcoming trial, turned down the defence’s arguments and sent the case once again to the Magistrates’ Court to compile Debono’s testimony. A sitting held earlier this month was taken up by hours of legal wrangling and a final decree by Magistrate Monica Vella ordering Debono to testify at the next hearing set for tomorrow. Now Muscat’s lawyers are claiming that Madam Justice Grima had not only “totally ignored” their arguments but had “misinterpreted and misquoted” them, attributing to them “imaginary and false submissions” which they had never expressed. The defence had never said that Debono was found guilty of perjury but had stated clearly that he was convicted for refusing to testify. Whilst bowing down to court decisions, it was “unacceptable” for the judge to misquote the defence, argued Muscat’s lawyers, pointing out further that most of their submissions had been based on the judgment delivered against Debono by Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja on appeal after his refusal to tell the whole truth. Such an attitude breached Muscat’s right to a fair hearing and amounted to inhuman and degrading punishment or treatment. His rights were further breached through the procedure followed when assigning his case to Madam Justice Grima.  Citing a recent judgment delivered against Yorgen Fenech about the selection of the judge presiding over the businessman’s trial, Muscat’s lawyers argued that the Justice Minister was never meant to intervene in the process. The correct procedure set down by the Constitution was for the Chief Justice to recommend a particular judge who is then nominated by the President of Malta. In this case, the assignment to Madam Justice Grima was “approved and signed as advised by the Minister for Justice and Governance…” along with the President’s signature. Whilst the Chief Justice followed the correct procedure the rest of the process is all vitiated and in breach of the Constitution, Muscat's lawyers have argued, stressing that this too breached the accused’s fundamental rights. Muscat asked the court to declare the breach and to provide adequate remedies as well as moral damages. His lawyers also questioned why the judge had not abstained from presiding over the case when she had presided over another trial of Muscat as well as the compilation of evidence in the HSBC case when Debono was still a co-accused. Lawyers Franco Debono and Roberto Montalto signed the application. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Pelin Kaya murder witness: accused stoned me, said he was 'king of Gżira'
Body: A woman has described how Jeremie Camilleri hit her in the head with a stone and declared he was "the king of Gżira" after mowing down and killing Pelin Kaya.  Fiona Brincat gave evidence in the compilation of evidence against Camilleri, who is accused of murdering the Turkish woman when he rammed his car into her while high on cocaine.  The witness told the court that she had run out of cigarettes and caught a cab to Gżira to buy a fresh supply. But she had barely got out of the taxi and approached a shop when she sensed someone walking towards her. She had just caught sight of a woman, later identified as the victim, lying on the street and was telling her partner, “poor soul! Jaħasra, miskina,” when the stranger walked up to her, whipped off his top and suddenly hit her on the head with a sizeable stone.    “Why?”was the only word Brincat could utter, taken completely off guard.  But all that her aggressor replied was, “the king of Gżira” and turned away, walking back to the BMW smashed into the glass front of the KFC shop on the other side of the road.  As soon as she felt cold blood trickling down her face, she left, seeking safety. “I escaped. There were no ambulances on site. And my head was smashed. He could have killed me,” said the witness, adding that the doctor who had treated her at the health clinic had put that down on the medical certificate.  Asked by the court whether she could identify her aggressor, the witness replied, “100%,” turning round and pointing directly at the accused seated at the dock next to his interpreter.  The witness said that Camilleri only hit her once but the wound was jagged and needed careful suturing.  She recalled how at the time of the incident, many people were shouting at the aggressor, saying  “what are you doing? Crazy!” and taking videos and photos of the man.  A police officer from the Sliema police station testified about the call that came through around 1.10am on the night of January, reporting that a woman had been knocked down on Testaferrata Street, Gżira. “To tell the truth, the sight of the victim continued to haunt me for several days,” said sergeant Sandro Mangion who described the scene of the incident which he soon realized was no ordinary traffic accident but most likely a murder case.  An emergency specialist had told the witnesses that the victim had little chance of survival.  Mangion then recalled hearing shouting.  It was Camilleri, handcuffed and arguing with RIU officers who had to taser him and were trying to calm him down.  A third party eyewitness told the sergeant that the BMW driver had thrown stones at his car, at people and also at the body of the woman lying on the ground.  Everybody on site was scared and all said that the driver had got out of his car and threw stones at them and at the victim. The sergeant also recalled how two days after the incident, a woman had turned up at the police station reporting how Camilleri had hit her on the head with a stone when she dropped by Gżira to buy cigarettes.  There were stitches on her head, explained Mangion who had taken down her report.  A Gżira resident who lived close to the incident site, had slept through the whole episode only waking up to the news on social media the next morning.  He went out to his car before heading to work around 8am, recalled David Buhagiar. He had parked it at the central strip near the Paul and Rocco petrol station the previous night and that was where he found it the next morning, its side damaged.  By that time, most of the debris caused by the crash had been cleared away.  All he saw was the broken glass front of the KFC outlet.  Police instructed him to obtain a quote for the damages but several panel beaters appeared reluctant to provide a valuation.  The car owner had finally decided to pay for the repairs, forking out €212.40 for which he produced a receipt in court.  The case presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello continues.  Inspector Kurt Zahra is prosecuting, assisted by AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett and Nathaniel Falzon. Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene Daramanin are defence counsel. Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi, Charlon Gouder and Ramona Attard appeared parte civile.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Editorial: domestic abuse system failures
Body: At the time Bernice Cassar was killed in what the police say is a femicide case, another woman was going through a very similar, if not identical, experience. When she decided to file a police report, she had to wait for more than two hours before being told to return the next day as they were busy. The report was finally made but nothing changed and she was forced to leave her partner who kept harassing her, even threatening that she and her child would “suffer for the rest of your life”. So, she filed another police report and also took a risk assessment within the DASH – the Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification – system. Her risk factor was rated at “medium”, scoring 11, just like Cassar. A restriction order against her partner was issued but the harassment persisted. Again, she reported him to the police and waited for some form of action to be taken. No wonder the news of Cassar’s murder left her devastated. “This is a complete farce,” the poor woman laments, insisting not enough is being done to support domestic violence victims. Some action was taken after Cassar’s murder. An inquiry concluded that the state system failed her, notably because of lack of resources and a heavy workload. Among other things, the inquiry had to determine whether the authorities were or should have been aware that Cassar’s life was in danger, which should really apply to all domestic violence victims going through her same ordeal. However, only the recommendations have been published so far.   Still, the retired judge conducting the inquiry did conclude that “in practice, nothing is done and things just keep going even though it is known that the system is not working… There are many proposals but the implementation is lacking”. One of the inquiry’s recommendations promises to take shape soon. The police have announced that the Santa Luċija station will be changed into a hub for the gender-based and domestic violence unit. The police also said they have just updated their internal standard operating procedure guidelines on domestic and gender violence in line with the inquiry recommendations. We are told the guidelines list officers’ responsibilities when responding to calls or speaking to victims and their role when dealing with temporary protection and protection orders. It does not seem that the guidelines themselves were actually published. They should have been for accountability’s sake but, more importantly, so victims would know exactly what to expect and demand. That would help determine whether measures and protocols in place or recommended are being implemented or not. As the inquiry into Cassar’s death concluded, implementation remains an issue. The failure to act on proposals made along the years has also been noted by those working with domestic violence victims. And it would be in order to point out that the victims go beyond those being physically, mentally or emotionally abused. Children, parents, siblings and next of kin may be in danger too. Neither should those willing to assist and support victims be ignored, as proven by the tragic case of Sylvia King, 36, who was burned alive in her car 30 years ago. If there is a lesson to learn from domestic violence cases is that time is of the essence. Systems need to be put in place as soon as possible to act fast against the perpetrators. Present domestic violence victims may not still be around by that time. Correction May 17, 2023: A previous version featured a photo that included Sylvia King. King was not a domestic violence victim and was murdered by a third party, not anyone related to her.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man arraigned for robbing taxi driver, then driving off with his car
Body: A man who allegedly held a weapon against a cab driver's head and then made off with his taxi, money and all, was arraigned and remanded in custody on Monday.  The incident allegedly took place at Valley Road, Msida on Saturday around 9pm. Mahmoud Moghrabi, a 33-year-old Tunisian construction worker pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft, holding the cab driver against his will, illegally carrying a weapon and stealing number plates from a third-party vehicle. He also denied breaching bail conditions, committing the alleged offences while under a suspended sentence as well as relapsing.  The driver had reported that a passenger got into the Peugeot 308, placed a weapon against his head, and demanded money. He then pushed him out of the driver's seat and drove off in the taxi.  Within half an hour the police tracked down the stolen vehicle and found the accused removing the car number plates to replace them with others he had allegedly stolen from another vehicle parked nearby.  The suspect was arrested.  He asked for medical assistance and was taken to Mount Carmel Hospital, from where he was discharged shortly before his arraignment.   His lawyers Mario and Nicholas Mifsud did not request bail at the arraignment stage.  Inspectors Lydon Zammit and Jonathan Ransley prosecuted.

Title: Nurse in Germany gets life term for killing two patients
Body: A Munich court sentenced a 27-year-old male nurse to life in prison Monday for murdering two patients by deliberately administering unprescribed drugs so he could be "left in peace". The nurse, identified only as Mario G., was also found guilty on six counts of attempted murder, a spokesman for the Munich district court in southern Germany said. During his trial, Mario G. admitted to injecting patients with sedatives and other drug cocktails while working in the recovery room at a Munich hospital. "I wanted to be left in peace," Mario G. told the court. Three of the attempts targeted the German intellectual and writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger in November 2020, but he survived. Enzensberger died two years later of natural causes, at the age of 93. The two patients who died as a result of Mario G.'s actions were 80 and 89 years old. According to prosecutors, Mario G. administered the drugs because he wanted to be left alone during his shift, when he was often hung over. The case recalled that of notorious German nurse Niels Hoegel, who was sentenced in 2019 to life in prison for murdering 85 patients in his care. Hoegel, believed to be Germany's most prolific serial killer, murdered patients with lethal injections between 2000 and 2005, before he was eventually caught in the act. In 2020, a Polish healthcare worker was sentenced to life in prison in Munich for killing at least three people with insulin.

Title: Woman accused of filing false rape claim gets bail
Body: A company director charged with falsely reporting being raped by a Bolt taxi driver and held in custody for almost two weeks has been granted bail. Earlier this month, a court heard that the 45-year-old, whose name is being withheld to protect her minor son, had booked a ride on the way back home in St Paul's Bay at around 3am.  She later claimed that the driver took a detour and raped her near a caravan site.  When confronted by the allegations, the driver denied the rape, claiming sex was consensual.  The vehicle trip record showed the driver had taken a different route than that alleged by the woman, who is pleading not guilty. The woman was charged with reporting the man for a crime she knew he did not commit, taking a false oath and fabricating evidence. She was denied bail in view of the serious nature of the offences, and the fact that civilians were still to testify.  When the case continued after her arraignment, the alleged victim - the Bolt driver - testified about the events of that night.  Following his testimony, the court, presided by Magistrate Astrid May Grima, upheld the accused's second request for bail against a deposit of €3,000, a personal guarantee of €10,000 and a curfew.

Title: 'Leave your abuser for your children's sake': domestic violence survivor warns
Body: A young woman who recently walked away from an abusive relationship has shared her story to encourage mothers to leave abusive partners, insisting that is the best decision for them and their children. All too often, women stay in abusive relationships for their children. This emerged in court this week when the sister of femicide victim Bernice Cassar – whose husband is charged with killing her in November last year – said that, for many years, Bernice wanted to stay in the marriage “to keep her family together”.   The woman – who is not being named to protect her child – came forward to share the message of hope to mothers who feared making the leap. “Going back is the easy way out,” she said. “I would get beaten every few weeks or months but, at least, I would not have to face all this hassle – the threats and the expenses. I am the victim, yet, in the past two years I’ve had to fork out thousands of euros in lawyers’ fees for something I did not do. "I also used to go to a psychologist every week for a couple of weeks to try and figure out what was going on and try to understand how someone else’s brain works,” she said. She explained how the violence started a few months into their relationship. Her partner beat her, then apologised and assured her that it was a one-off. She believed him because she loved him and, when she later became pregnant, she believed that would change everything.  RELATED STORIES  “I went to a psychologist. He told me something that stayed with me. He helped me see that my partner was behaving the way he was because it was normal to him – he was brought up in that environment. That was when it hit me: I could not let my child grow up thinking this was normal,” she said. So, the next time he hit her she went to file a police report. She took her toddler with her and had to wait for over two hours before she was told she’d better return the next day as they were busy. Sometime later she returned and filed the report. Things did not change and she eventually moved in with her parents and tried to rebuild her life by working full-time to save money to build a home with her child.   Meanwhile, the partner kept harassing her, saying he wanted her back and sending threatening messages including that she and her child would “suffer for the rest of your life”.   It was around that time that Cassar was killed. “I was at work when the news spread. I cried so much. It could have been me,” she said. She filed another police report about the threats and consented to take a risk assessment using the tool known as the DASH system – the Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification. Her risk factor resulted to be “medium” after she scored 11 – the same score achieved by Cassar. This emerged during the court case against the victim’s husband, Roderick Cassar, who was charged with her murder on November 22, 2022. “This is a complete farce. Her case was so much worse than mine,” said the woman, adding that, this time, the case against her partner was appointed to be heard as a compilation of evidence. He admitted to the charges and there is a restriction order to stop him from harassing her. Since then, the protection order was breached and she filed another report on this matter – she is waiting for action to be taken. The woman feels that not enough is being done to support domestic violence victims. The government plans to introduce legislation that allows a person to check if their partner has a history of abuse. “Does this make sense? For me, the answer is no. If one had to check and confront the partner that there were such cases, I can assure you that, somehow,  they will blame the victim and convince you that it was not their fault,” she said. She believes more has to be done to educate victims, by spelling out to them the reality they are in. “Are victims aware that almost 100 per cent of the time the perpetrator will do the same thing over and over again? Is there awareness or are we just telling victims to make the first step and file the report and, then, nothing? "It’s not easy for a victim to remain strong, especially when it takes months to go to court. Remember, the perpetrator will shower the victim with gifts, begging him or her to drop the charges,” she said.  RELATED STORIES  Her message is that the only way out is for the victim to take the step and walk away. “This is the message I wish to share: be strong, there is hope. Taking the decision to move out of such a relationship is the scariest thing ever as you’ll be going into the unknown. "However, once they make such a decision, even if it will take ages to find themselves again after being controlled by someone for months or years, they will realise that it will be the best decision for them and their loved ones.”   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man enters taxi, robs driver, throws him out of car, and drives off
Body: The police on Saturday night arrested two men just a few moments after one of them allegedly threatened and robbed a taxi driver. In a statement, the police said that a person booked the taxi and as soon as this arrived on site – at Triq il-Wied Tal-Imsida in Msida at 9pm, one of the two men who have been arrested entered the car, threatened the driver with a weapon and requested money. After the driver gave the thief the money, the latter ordered the driver out of the car and he escaped with it. The police immediately started searching for the car and around an hour later circled it in Triq il-Ħarrub. Next to it were two men – a 33-year-old from Msida and a 53-year-old from Mosta, one of which had allegedly committed the theft. Both were arrested and searched and they were found in possession of some items related to the case. They are currently being held at the police headquarters for questioning.

Title: YouTuber admits staging plane crash for views, faces up to 20 years jail
Body: A YouTuber pilot who bailed out midair and deliberately sent his plane crashing into the ground to bolster viewing numbers on his channel could be jailed for up to 20 years, US authorities said Thursday. In a video seen by nearly three million people and entitled I crashed my airplane, Trevor Jacob appears to experience engine trouble while flying over southern California in November 2021. The dramatic footage shows Jacob, 29, ejecting from the single-engine plane - selfie-stick in hand - and parachuting into the dense vegetation of the Los Padres National Forest.    Cameras placed all over the aircraft show its out-of-control descent into the forest and its eventual crash landing. Jacob films himself hiking to the wreckage where he appears dismayed to discover the water he packed has disappeared. Viewers see him bush-whacking through poison oak and over hills as he seemingly struggles to find civilization, giving regular updates about how thirsty he is, and how lost he feels. Finally, he stops to scoop water from a stream, and moments later comes across a vehicle and apparent salvation as night falls. In the weeks after the incident, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched a probe into the crash, and Jacob was ordered to preserve the wreckage. The YouTuber told officials he did not know where the plane had gone down, but, according to a plea deal lodged in Los Angeles, two weeks after the drama he and a friend winched the wreckage out of the forest with a helicopter, having earlier recovered data from the onboard cameras. Over the next few days, he cut up the plane into small pieces and dumped the parts in trash bins in and around Lompoc City Airport. The FAA, the body that regulates flying in the United States, yanked Jacob's pilot's license in April 2022. In a plea agreement, Jacob admitted he had intended to obstruct federal authorities when he disposed of the wreckage and had created the video to make money through a sponsorship with a wallet company. "Jacob further admitted he lied to federal investigators when he submitted an aircraft accident incident report that falsely indicated that the aircraft experienced a full loss of power approximately 35 minutes after takeoff," a statement from the Department of Justice said. "Jacob also lied to an FAA aviation safety inspector when he said the aeroplane's engine had quit and, because he could not identify any safe landing options, he had parachuted out of the plane." He has agreed to plead guilty to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation, a crime that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. The YouTuber is expected to formally enter his plea in Los Angeles in the coming weeks, and be sentenced at a later date. The video he posted attracted a lot of criticism in the weeks and months after it was published. Numerous pilots and aviation experts commented that Jacob had failed to take even elementary steps to restart his plane's apparently troubled engine. Others pointed out that he could easily have safely glided the plane to a landing spot, and that wearing a parachute while flying a small aircraft was highly unusual.

Title: Police and firefighters injured in explosion in Germany
Body: A 57-year-old man on Thursday sparked an explosion at a block of flats in western Germany, wounding 12 police officers and firefighters who had been responding to a call of distress, authorities said.  The blast happened inside an apartment in the high-rise building in Ratingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, police said on Twitter. Ten firefighters and two police officers were injured, some of them seriously, Herbert Reul, North Rhine-Westphalia's interior minister, told reporters. Emergency services had arrived after receiving a distress call. The door of the flat was open when police got to the site but the blast then ensued. "The man, after he caused this explosion, closed the door again, retreated and started to set the place on fire," said Reul. A lifeless body was also found in the flat, Reul said, adding that it may be that of the suspect's mother. Police on Twitter referred to a "major operation" at the site. The flat had apparently been doused with petrol or another flammable substance, Bild daily said. The arrested man was a suspected Covid denier, according to Der Spiegel magazine. Reul said it was "incomprehensible" to him that police officers and firefighters went on a mission to help and "ended up risking their lives".

Title: Repubblika seek commissioner's resignation over Pilatus revelations inaction
Body: Rule of law NGO Repubblika has demanded Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa's resignation following his "continued inaction" over revelations that claim the police staged a cover-up to refrain from prosecuting officials linked to the now-shuttered Pilatus Bank. In a book on the now shuttered bank published last month, Repubblika president Robert Aquilina features a series of e-mails the group says is evidence of the way three police inspectors discussed how they needed to justify the decision not to prosecute Pilatus Bank’s former risk manager and operations supervisor, despite a magisterial inquiry recommending money-laundering charges against them. In a press conference outside police headquarters in Floriana on Thursday, Aquilina said the police commissioner had shirked his responsibility to the public by failing to react to this “shocking and unprecedented evidence”.  “He is accountable to the public and should have given a public explanation about what I have revealed,” Aquilina said. “Instead he has behaved like a ghost and has run away from journalists and the people seeking answers from him.” While Gafa had said that he would be replying in court, Aquilina said this was unacceptable because the police commissioner knew proceedings were being carried out behind closed doors, where Repubblika did not have the opportunity to rebut his replies in a public forum. “Angelo Gafa is the biggest threat to justice taking its course in our country,” Aquilina charged. “In three years as police commissioner he had not charged any big fish that broke the law.  The only people who have peace of mind are the corrupt clique.” Gafa, he said, has consistently failed to take action on big cases such as Panama Papers, Electrogas, 17 Black, the Montenegro wind farms, the sale of Maltese hospitals or abuse and money laundering in Azerbaijan. “He had staged a cover-up on every one of these abuses through his inaction,” Aquilina said. Gafa had ended up with the same reputation of inaction as his predecessor Lawrence Cutajar. Aquilina urged Gafa to resign as police commissioner and step aside and leave it in the hands of people capable of leading the police corps with integrity and “out of the hole” that he had dug the country into.

Title: Russia, Ukraine report drone attacks as Zelensky visits ICC
Body: Kyiv and Moscow reported drone attacks Thursday including two that sparked fires in Russian oil refineries, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited The Hague to lobby for more support. Zelensky's surprise visit to meet top officials of the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Russian leader Vladimir Putin, came a day after Moscow accused Kyiv of a drone attack on the Kremlin. Russia has accused Ukraine of trying to kill Putin, but Zelensky denied his country was behind the Kremlin strike.   He is due to meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren and make a speech entitled "No peace without justice for Ukraine".   An AFP correspondent saw Zelensky arrive at the ICC under heavy security measures, as a Ukrainian flag was flown at the court. The Netherlands has pledged both financial and military support to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.  The country announced last month that it would buy 14 Leopard 2 tanks with Denmark to give to Kyiv, which is demanding more heavy weapons. The Ukrainian air force said Thursday that Russia had fired 24 attack drones overnight, of which 18 were downed. Authorities said there were no casualties. "The invaders launched up to 24 Shahed-136/131 attack drones... The Air Force of Ukraine, in cooperation with other air defence units, shot down 18 attack drones," the air force said on Telegram. Sergiy Popko, the head of the city of Kyiv's military administration, said that "all enemy missiles and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were destroyed over Kyiv by air defence forces". Popko said it was the third day of attempted strikes on Kyiv in May. "Our city has not experienced such intensity of strikes since the beginning of this year," he said, adding that debris from the downed drones had fallen on different parts of the city but there were no casualties. Russia on Thursday said a drone attack in the southern Krasnodar region's Ilsky settlement sparked a blaze at an oil refinery. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said the refinery fire had been localised to a 400-square-metre (4,300-square-foot) area and was quickly extinguished by emergency services. Shortly afterwards the governor of Russia's Rostov region, which also borders Ukraine, said a drone had hit a local refinery near the village of Kiselevka and caused an explosion and a fire. A similar blaze Wednesday at an oil reservoir in the nearby village of Volna engulfed 1,200 square metres, with officials also blaming a drone crash. That same day, Moscow said it shot down two drones aimed at Putin's residence and accused Ukraine of attempting a "terrorist act", with the Kremlin threatening a tough response. Ukraine has denied any involvement and the country's Western allies have also cast doubt on the report. "We do not attack Putin or Moscow," Zelensky said on a visit to Finland. "We defend our villages and cities." On Wednesday, Kyiv said Russian strikes had killed 21 people in the southern region of Kherson, including at a supermarket and a train station.  The spate of apparent sabotage attacks has been used to underscore Russia's exposure to enemy blows as the Kremlin gears up for important anniversary celebrations. The May 9 victory celebrations that commemorate the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II have become a central event during Putin's rule. Kyiv suggested that Moscow "staged" the attack, which came ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian spring counter-offensive. The US said the Russian report should be taken with a "shaker of salt".

Title: Suspect arrested in deadly Atlanta hospital shooting
Body: Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting five people - one of whom died - at an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday, authorities in the southern US city said. One person was killed and four were injured when Deion Patterson allegedly opened fire in a hospital waiting room just after midday (1700 GMT). Patterson then allegedly stole a truck that had been left running at a nearby gas station and fled.  A manhunt went into the night before Patterson was apprehended outside the city in neighbouring Cobb County.    "Law enforcement have taken the suspect into custody," Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said at a news conference Wednesday evening. "He will be charged and stand trial for his crimes." Patterson was detained "without incident," said Cobb County police chief Stuart VanHoozer. The victims, all women, were aged between 25 and 71, police said at an earlier news conference.   The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office later identified the woman shot and killed as Amy St. Pierre, 38, CNN reported. St. Pierre worked for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency told the broadcaster. Three other women were in intensive care and a fourth victim was in stable condition, CNN reported. Police chief Darin Schierbaum said local authorities received assistance in the search for Patterson from multiple agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service.   Patterson had been accompanied in the hospital waiting room by his mother, who was not injured in the shooting, Schierbaum said. CNN reported he became "enraged" during a visit before opening fire. It was too soon to know if any of the victims were targeted specifically, Schierbaum added. The suspect's family cooperated with the investigation, he said. As police were scouring the greater Atlanta area, they published a photo of Patterson, wearing dark pants, a hood over his head and a white surgical mask, wielding a handgun. Television footage showed police and other law enforcement officers deployed at the scene. Multiple ambulances were also present. The shooting sent several schools near the hospital into temporary lockdown.  "Out of an abundance of caution, we have dispatched officers at every school for today's dismissal," Atlanta Public Schools announced on its website once the lockdowns were lifted. The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed on the shooting. Spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the president's hands were tied on "more steps to deal with the violence that we're seeing in our communities or schools or churches." "American people should be able to feel free to go into a grocery store, to go to church," Jean-Pierre said. There have been more than 190 mass shootings - defined as four or more people wounded or killed - so far this year in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. With more firearms than inhabitants, the United States has the highest rate of gun-related deaths of any developed country: 49,000 in 2021, up from 45,000 the year before.

Title: Psychiatrists: Murder accused was convinced his relatives planned to kill him
Body: Updated 5.20pm with sister's testimony A man who is pleading insanity at the time he stabbed his mother and aunt to death at the family’s Għargħur home, was convinced that the pair were conspiring to kill him and his delusion persisted today, psychiatrists testified at his trial on Wednesday. Kevin Micallef is undergoing trial by jury to determine whether he was insane when he committed the stabbing early in July 2018 after allegedly hearing Maria Carmela Fenech, his aunt asking his mother, Antonia Micallef, whether “he had realized.” That comment, on the back of an almost sleepless night and an ever-present belief that the two were putting something in his coffee, had suddenly made him “click,” Micallef later told police. Putting aside his unfinished cup of strong coffee, Micallef told police he had grabbed a long knife from the kitchen and headed into the washroom striking his aunt with the weapon before turning upon his mother. The aunt was killed on site, while her sister passed away a few hours later after being rushed to hospital by an ambulance team dispatched to the crime scene following a call to 112 he himself made. Medico-legal expert Mario Scerri took the witness stand on Wednesday, giving a detailed account of the forensic evidence he had personally attested after he got to the scene at 7:40am. Fenech’s corpse lay face up on the patterned tiled floor, close to the washing machine that was splattered with blood. Her arms were spread out, knife wounds visible on the thighs and there was a pool of blood and more blood stains on the floor. The alleged murder weapon, a long-bladed pointed knife with one cutting edge lay blood-smeared on a white table outside the washroom in the inner courtyard, next to a potted plant, a bunch of keys and a glass. The accused’s mother had suffered lesions on the neck and had long cuts on her hands, indicating that she had tried to defend herself against the blows. The doctor had noticed the accused standing on the pavement outside the house that day. He looked scared and was trembling, recalled Scerri. His movements had immediately prompted the doctor to advise referral to Mount Carmel Hospital. Those movements, described in medical terms as ‘ballo di San Vito’ were symptomatic of Huntington’s disease. A blood test carried out at a laboratory in Germany subsequently confirmed that Micallef was suffering from that disease which caused erosion of brain cells and was irreversible. But at the time of the incident in 2018, he had not yet been diagnosed. “It’s rather ugly. There’s no cure for it,” said psychiatrist Maria Axiak, one of a line of specialists summoned by the prosecution on Wednesday.   Axiak said she had taken Micallef under her care at Mount Carmel Hospital's Forensic Unit where he was admitted hours after the crime on July 23, 2018. “He was still confused, still did not realize what had happened,” recalled the psychiatrist. As time passed and medication began to take effect, realization began to dawn on the accused, who was overcome by sadness. Micallef went through trauma, as reality sank in, missing out on sleep for months on end on account of flashbacks. When the blood test from Germany confirmed the “rather heavy” diagnosis of Huntington’s disease, family support was very important at that stage. That disease, coupled with psychosis, meant that at the time of the double attack, Micallef was acting under the “fixed false belief” that his relatives were conspiring to kill him. That belief or delusion was confirmed by all seven psychiatrists who testified on Wednesday. Two groups of specialists said they had assessed the accused and prepared two separate reports, all confirming that the man lacked “mens rea” (the will and understanding) when he committed the stabbing. “He saw no alternative. Unless he did something they would kill him,” explained psychiatrist Joseph Cassar who testified via video link. His colleagues, Ethel Felice and Nigel Camilleri, confirmed that Micallef had acted under that belief that was strongly ingrained in his mind. Questioned at length by the jurors, the psychiatrists explained that they had discussed whether Micallef was lying and was making up a story. “But his account was relatively consistent from A to B and then Huntington’s was diagnosed. It was very unlikely that he took all professionals for a ride.” The fact that he had dialled 112 instead of trying to escape, was in itself further proof of his insanity. Professor Anton Grech took the witness stand jointly with his colleagues George Debono and Anthony Zahra, likewise confirming that Micallef suffered from psychosis within the context of Huntington’s disease. His psychotic state originated months prior to the crime and when committing the attack Micallef was delusional and in a state of insanity. “He had no autonomy, no free will.” Consultant neurologist Malcolm Vella said she had examined Micallef some three years ago. The patient had complained of memory loss and hallucinations, saying that he heard voices controlling him. Certain defects in eye movement were indicative of his as-yet-undiagnosed condition. But the DNA test results from Germany left no doubt. The disease is present when results show 40 plus repeats, explained the witness. In Micallef’s case, the result was 44. The accused’s father and brother had also been similarly diagnosed and had passed away at a young age. Micallef’s sister, Karen Camilleri, testified that her brother was a “true gentleman” who always went out of his way to help his mother. But in the weeks before the murders, something had drastically changed, she recalled. “Kevin changed a lot. He began to fight with everyone,” his sister testified. She told the court that he had called his brother-in-law asking for money, and claimed she was jealous of him. The Wednesday before the murders, he had turned up at her husband’s workplace, armed with a metal bar and demanding €2000. “He was doubtlessly losing his mind,” she testified. On the day before the incident, Camilleri received a text message from her brother, telling her that he would “move out” of the family home so “that they could partition [the property].” “It was a nonsensical message,” said the witness, explaining that the siblings had never had any discussions about family property. “It was all in the mind…He imagined it all but nothing happened.”  “I always believed that he was a good man and I will do everything to help him until I die. I forgave him.” She said that she visited her brother at Mount Carmel regularly and were it not for those family visits, “he had no one.” “He’s got Huntington’s and that’s what caused all this.”   The trial now reaches its final stages. Defence lawyer Francois Dalli urged jury members to detach themselves from prejudice and bias and emphasised the fact that all psychiatrists had confirmed Micallef’s insanity. The tiredness the accused had complained of, the movements noticed by doctor Scerri immediately after the murders as well as his depression all added up. “Huntington’s is known as the Devil’s disease,” with symptoms similar to Parkinson’s, ALS and dementia, said Dalli. The fact that the accused had dialled 112 instead of trying to escape, showed his behaviour was not normal, the defence lawyer argued. "His paranoia had long been there. He believed his mother was the cause of his marriage breakdown, that she scared off any potential partners to keep him to herself. He knew that killing was wrong but the will not to do so was absent," Dalli argued. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera is presiding.

Title: Police in eight EU countries raid 150 addresses in anti-mafia swoop
Body: Updated 2.40pm  Police across Europe launched a vast, coordinated operation against Italy's notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia on Wednesday, arresting more than 130 people and seizing millions of euros in dozens of searches. "It is likely the biggest operation ever carried out in Europe against the Calabrese mafia," said a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutors' office, Eric van Duyse, which initiated the operation. European policing agency Europol said 132 alleged members of the 'Ndrangheta had been taken into custody during an "action day" involving 10 countries - eight in Europe plus Brazil and Panama. They are accused of crimes including mafia association, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, money laundering and tax fraud, following a probe that has uncovered the global reach of the wealthy organised crime group. The 'Ndrangheta is Italy's most powerful and wealthy mafia, controlling the bulk of cocaine flowing into Europe and operating in more than 40 countries across the world.   It has successfully expanded well beyond its traditional domains of drug trafficking and loan sharking, now using shell companies and frontmen to reinvest illegal gains in the worldwide legitimate economy. The majority of the arrests were in Italy, according to authorities there, with the others concentrated in Germany and Belgium. More than 2,770 police officers were involved in the operations in 10 countries, which also included France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Romania, Europol said. Operation Eureka "now stands as the largest hit involving the Italian poly-criminal syndicate to date", the agency said in a statement. Italian authorities said assets and property worth 25 million euros had been seized in Italy, Portugal, Germany and France. Belgian prosecutors said some 150 addresses were raided in eight European countries, in searches that involved 1,400 police officers in Italy and more than 1,000 in Germany. The operation was focused on a criminal network led by several 'Ndrangheta families based in the town of San Luca, in the southern Italian province of Reggio Calabria. A feud between rival clans from San Luca was responsible for a 2007 massacre in Germany, when six people were killed outside a pizzeria in the town of Duisburg. That crime for the first time helped raise public awareness of the 'Ndrangheta outside Italy. The network hit on Wednesday "was mainly devoted to international drug trafficking from South America to Europe, as well as Australia", Europol said. They had links with Colombia's "Gulf Clan" crime group and an Albanian-speaking group operating in Ecuador and across Europe, it said. The investigation also revealed an offer to sell a container of weapons via Pakistani intermediaries to Brazilian paramilitaries, in exchange for cocaine to be delivered to the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro. A spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor's office said it had launched the European investigation and had been working on the case for "four, five years", in cooperation with other EU states. Italian authorities confirmed they had begun their investigations in June 2019, at the request of the Belgians, focusing on one San Luca family active in the Belgian town of Genk. A Belgian police officer told a news conference in Italy how he and his team befriended suspects at a port in Belgium before being "invited to join them on their holidays in San Luca".    That friendship allowed them to gather key evidence against them, he said. The inquiry initially focused on international drug trafficking but was later widened to include money laundering, particularly in the catering, tourism and real estate sectors, and the arms trade, Italian authorities said. Based in Calabria, the region that forms the tip of Italy's boot, the 'Ndrangheta is considered one of the world's most powerful crime syndicates due to its grip on the cocaine import market.  It has extended its reach across all parts of the world, and it has long surpassed Sicily's Cosa Nostra as Italy's biggest mafia organisation.

Title: Contractor accused of VAT fraud owned lions, tigers and two Lamborghinis
Body: A building contractor accused of evading millions in tax owned dozens of exotic animals including tigers and lions as well as luxury cars including two Lamborghinis, a court heard on Tuesday. Details of those assets emerged in court at Martin Farrugia’s first court hearing.  The Rabat-based contractor is pleading not guilty to criminal association, making false declarations to the tax commissioner, money laundering and fraud dating back a decade. He has spent the past two weeks in jail after a court denied him bail after he was arraigned.  Farrugia is facing charges alongside Henriette Cassar, from Zebbug, registered as his full-time administrative clerk. Both were escorted back to court on Monday when the compilation of evidence kicked off.  Inspector Joseph Xerri told the court that suspicions about Farrugia were flagged by the VAT department. A number of clients had made claims for refunds on capital investments and the common denominator in those claims were invoices issued by Farrugia. Police stepped in and reviewed a number of claims. They finally identified 44 of Farrugia’s clients and summoned them for questioning. They also carried out inspections at various properties to confirm that the works had actually been done.  The main subject was Farrugia, a Maltese contractor living at Rabat with other properties at Siġġiewi and Mellieħa. He was married, had three children and had fathered three other children with his partner.  Farrrugia was registered for VAT purposes since January 2014.  When police checked manual fiscal receipts linked to the suspected fraud, various discrepancies came to light, explained Xerri.  For example, a receipt Farrugia issued to a client showed an amount of €70, 210 (grey receipt) whereas the book copy (yellow receipt) showed the amount as €702.10.  The handwriting on the customer and book copy was different.  The surname of one of the clients also did not match and the VAT number was missing in the book copy.  Although the papers in the VAT receipt book were carbonized, other details in the two kinds of receipts also varied.  For instance, one receipt was for “works carried out” while the corresponding book copy said it was for “finishings.” The inspector then delved into a breakdown of the claims made by each of the clients at the VAT department, the actual value of the investment and the suspected fraud, supporting each case with photographic evidence gathered during the inspections carried out to confirm the works.  Most of the works concerned excavation and building works at farms in various localities, with the construction of manure pits, cow sheds, garages and paving, stalls and storerooms. Most payments were effected in cash, with clients telling police that Farrugia would “insist on cash” and was “not too happy with cheques.” In certain cases, Farrugia had engaged third parties to carry out the works.  One client said that he sometimes witnessed Farrugia paying workers on site and in cash.  Among the clients questioned by police was a woman who used to run a beauty shop at Qormi as well as the operator of a boutique hotel in Valletta who had engaged Farrugia to rebuild the property.  During his testimony, Xerri also listed a number of exotic animals owned by Farrugia.  The list included seven lions, six tigers, eight pumas, two leopards, two black leopards and sixteen horses found at Farrugia’s farms in the limits of Rabat and Siġġiewi.  Farrugia had allegedly told police that he had to spend some €1000 a week to feed his exotic pets and was currently limiting their food supply to white meat.  Among Farrugia’s assets was also a fleet of luxurious vehicles including two Lamborghinis, two Porsche models, a Maserati, three Mercedes and two Land Rovers.  During Farrugia's arraignment, prosecutors told the court that they suspected Farrugia had defrauded the taxman of €4.2 million. Cassar became a suspect when investigators noted that she had deposited some €960,000 in cheques linked to Farrugia's business activities in her accounts, but had not declared any income with the Commissioner for Inland Revenue.  The case, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, continues.  AG lawyer Abigail Caruana Vella prosecuted, together with Inspector Joseph Xerri.Lawyers Etienne Borg Ferrante and Dominic Micallef are counsel to Farrugia. Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb are counsel to Cassar. Lawyers Stefano Filletti, Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri, Rebecca Mercieca and Noel Bianco appeared parte civile for various victims.

Title: Seven charged with terrorist-related offences
Body: A group of seven young men from Syria faced terrorism-related charges in court on Sunday. The men stand accused of spreading extremist propaganda, teaching others how to operate firearms and explosives and attempting to recruit people to commit acts of terrorism.   They were also charged with attempting to travel elsewhere in the EU to commit terrorist acts.   Ajil Al Muhsen, Adnan Maashi, Yazan Abduklaziz, Ahmed Kadas, Khalil Al Mahmoud, Ahmed Ahmed and Mohammed Mohammed all pleaded not guilty to the charges but did not request bail.   The men, who were greeted by a heavy police presence at the law courts, are aged between 21 and 27, with the majority living in Ħamrun. One man lives in Birkirkara while another one resides in Pietà.  Sunday’s court appearance follows an operation on Saturday morning carried out by the police in cooperation with Europol, the EU’s law enforcement authority that targets serious international crime and terrorism.   The prosecution’s request that the accuseds' assets be frozen was upheld and all seven were remanded in custody.   Duty magistrate Astrid May Grima presided over Sunday's hearing.

Title: Toddler, two boys among 101 rape victims reported to police since 2020
Body: Three boys aged two, five and nine were among the rape victims reported to police over the past four years, when an average of three rape reports a month were filed, according to police data. Information about rape cases reported to police showed a total of 101 rapes were reported since the beginning of 2020. The majority were women under 30. Three of the seven male victims were children: in 2020, police received a report about the rape of a five-year-old Maltese boy; the following year the rape of a nine-year-old Syrian boy was reported and, last year, the police received a report about the rape of a two-year-old Maltese boy. The data showed that in 2020 there were 18 reported rapes, 17 of which involved female victims. In 2021, the number rose to 31 (29 were female) and increased to 39 (36 females) last year. This year, so far, there have been 13 reported rapes (12 females). Throughout the same years, police received 157 reports of violent indecent assault: 39 reports in 2020, 42 in 2021, 68 in 2022 and eight so far this year. Violent indecent assault is the act of touching or the threat to touch a person’s body in a sexual manner without consent. For example, it can include unwanted touching of a person’s breasts, bottom or genitals. Rape is to force someone to have sex when they are unwilling, using violence, threatening behaviour, power or coercion. Rape can also occur when the victim is unable to give consent. Having sex with a minor ‒ a person under 16 ‒ is considered rape. A look at the ages of the alleged rape victims showed that 11 were under 15 years old and included the three boys aged two, five and nine. The rest were girls. Twenty-two victims were aged bet­ween 16 and 19; 31 victims were in their 20s, and 17 were in their 30s. Five of the victims were over the age of 60 and included a 70-year-old man. These figures are the tip of the iceberg, as research had shown that not all victims file a police report. In a recent interview with Times of Malta Victim Support Malta (VSM) director Karl Grech said that in 2022, 54 per cent of clients who experienced sexual assault did not file a report about the abuse as they felt the system was not on their side. Victims often do not file a report due to a number of reasons, some being due to experiencing a deep sense of guilt, shame, fear and re-traumatisation. In addition to this, the legal process is a long and thorough one which tends to discourage victims from report­ing the incident. The situation at the state hospital is also off-putting for victims. Last week, Times of Malta reported how rape and sexual assault survivors are often forced to wait for hours among other patients at Mater Dei Hospital before they are examined in their vulnerable state. The issue was first flagged by concerned doctors who spoke about the “urgent need” to address the lack of sensitivity and privacy in the way sexual assault and rape victims are being handled once they arrive at the state hospital. These views were backed by NGO Victim Support Malta (VSM), which reported an increase in sexual assault referrals made to them through Mater Dei Hospital this year. To date, in the first four months of the year, VSM has already received 12 referrals, compared to 28 throughout 2022, and 11 in 2001. Apart from the 12 referrals from Mater Dei this year, VSM received 13 other reports that were referred through other entities or self-referrals. Of the total 25 referrals received this year, 21 were women and four were men. The Health Ministry said it is working on extensive changes that include two rooms for the assessment of cases of sexual assault, so victims can be seen in greater privacy and comfort. This has now reached an advanced stage. If you have suffered a sexual assault and would like to access CVSA services, contact Victim Support Malta on 2122 8333 or email info@victimsupport.org.mt.

Title: How an HSBC manager perpetrated a modern-day ‘€1 million’ bank heist
Body: Updated with additional HSBC comments An HSBC manager has admitted to an audacious swindle involving unauthorised withdrawals from client accounts and forged signatures to fund an expensive Siġġiewi farmhouse, as well as his penchant for exotic birds. The bank is seeking to recover €1 million in misappropriated funds and damages from former mortgage protection manager Kenneth Gauci, who worked for the bank from 1989 until he was fired in August 2021. He was dismissed after complaints began to trickle in from HSBC’s clients over unexplained withdrawals and transfers, triggering an internal bank investigation and a criminal complaint. HSBC has admitted in civil court proceedings that to this very day, it has been unable to establish the full extent of the fraud, and there may be other clients who were impacted that they are not yet aware of. He also faces criminal charges of money laundering and fraud. Gauci is contesting the main charges by the police as well as the amount HSBC says was stolen. Gauci initially admitted to defrauding six clients, but a “complex” investigation carried out by the bank soon uncovered that many more had funds stolen or transferred without their consent. According to Gauci, he started carrying out unauthorised withdrawals and stealing cash deposits in 2019. The bank was only alerted to his actions two years later. HSBC describes Gauci as having been a “one-stop shop” for home loans. When the bank first caught wind of the missing client funds, it had spoken to bank tellers to try to establish how Gauci perpetrated the fraud. The investigation by HSBC was triggered by customer complaints about missing money from their account. HSBC quickly eliminated the possibility that the funds had been transferred out of client accounts due to some sort of administrative error. An HSBC investigator was told by bank tellers that it was normal for them to hand over cash to Gauci that had been withdrawn from a client’s account. Gauci would hand the tellers a document supposedly signed by HSBC clients authorising the withdrawal. Gauci would claim to the tellers that he was simply helping his clients avoid queuing up at the branch for their withdrawals, by handing them the money himself.  HSBC noted in its internal investigation that this blatantly breached bank rules, as cash withdrawals should only ever be given to clients directly, and not via a third party. When confronted about this, Gauci admitted to the bank that it was “indeed possible” that he had forged client signatures. Gauci also admitted that he would replace funds withdrawn from one client’s account by replacing them with funds illicitly withdrawn from another client’s account.   Predatory behaviour Gauci appears to have preyed on people who lacked formal education and may have not been technologically savvy. A family member of one of his victims told Times of Malta that his father, a pensioner who does not know how to read or write, trusted Gauci blindly. The man, who was still of working age at the time, would trust Gauci with cash deposits that were meant to be paid into his current account, yet the money given to the HSBC manager would not actually be paid in. Instead, Gauci would pay money into the pensioner’s account from other HSBC clients, to make it appear as if the cash had been deposited. The money would then be withdrawn again soon after, often the very next day, leaving just enough to cover automated monthly loan repayments that the man had. Banking records seen by Times of Malta appear to support the claims, with the account showing multiple deposits from third parties, which appear to have been Gauci’s attempt to cover the fact that the cash had not been deposited by transferring in money from other HSBC clients. The accounts also confirm that the money transferred in from other clients would often be withdrawn soon after. The pensioner has sued HSBC for damages, claiming that the bank only ever compensated him for a “small amount” of the money stolen by Gauci.   Expensive lifestyle Gauci says he started withdrawing customer funds in 2019, according to court filings. The funds, he told HSBC, were mainly used for the completion of a pricey Siġġiewi farmhouse, as well as funding his lifestyle and hobby of collecting exotic birds. Social media pictures of the secluded property indicate it plays host to a number of expensive pets, including birds and horses. Gauci admitted to also using client money to finance both his and his children’s living expenses. The bank manager described one of his victims as a “businessman and friend” who owned a pet shop. Much like the scheme used to defraud the pensioner, Gauci’s “friend” would give him cash to deposit, which the bank manager would then keep. To compensate for the theft, Gauci said he would debit other HSBC client accounts and deposit them into the pet shop owner’s account. As the net started to close in during the summer of 2021, Gauci sent an e-mail to HSBC colleagues, apologising for his actions. “I have worked with you all and you know that this is definitely not me. Not even I can understand what has happened,” he wrote, promising to “remediate” his actions. Two days later, the bank dismissed Gauci for gross misconduct, after initially having suspended him on half pay. In the disciplinary board hearing, Gauci was accused of falsifying and forging bank and client records, misappropriating funds, bringing the bank into disrepute, acting dishonestly and unlawfully, as well as serious procedural breaches.   Assets frozen by prosecutors Apart from their own internal probe, HSBC escalated the matter by referring the case to the police. The 51-year-old was quietly charged with money laundering and fraud last October, in an arraignment that went under the media’s radar. He denies the main charges. His assets were frozen by prosecutors, and HSBC’s separate civil case to recoup the claimed €1 million in misappropriated funds and interest is still ongoing. Gauci did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for HSBC said the bank is not in a position to comment on cases relating to individual customers or employees. “We take our role of protecting the interests of our customers and the wider financial system very seriously and expect our employees to adhere to the highest standards of conduct.” HSBC said it has “zero tolerance” for fraudulent activities and where there is evidence of misconduct, they take appropriate action, liaising with all parties concerned and informing the police and relevant authorities. In additional comments on Monday, the HSBC spokesperson said the bank's internal investigation has been concluded and all impacted customers identified and contacted.  "Appropriate action has been taken to safeguard our customers".  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Gunman on the run after five people shot dead in Texas
Body: Police were searching for a gunman believed to have shot dead five Hondurans including an eight-year-old child at a house in Texas, the local sheriff said Saturday, in the latest mass shooting to hit the United States. Investigators believe the gunman had been firing his AR-15 style gun in a neighboring yard when the victims asked him to stop, as they were trying to get a baby to sleep, US media reported. San Jacinto County Sheriff Greg Capers described a horrifying scene when authorities went to the residence after receiving a call about "harassment" around 11:30pm Friday. The victims, aged from eight to 40 years old, were strewn from the front door through the house to an inside bedroom, where two of them -- both women -- were found lying on top of two children who survived the massacre. "In my opinion, they were actually trying to take care of the babies and keep them babies alive," Capers told ABC's Houston station KTRK. All the victims had been shot "from the neck up almost execution style, basically in the head," he added. "He had been drinking and he says, 'I'll do what I want to in my front yard,'" Capers told KTRK. "All the victims were from Honduras," Capers told reporters, adding that 10 people had been in the house at the time.  He said that authorities believe they know who the gunman is, describing him as being from Mexico.  The sheriff's office said later on its Facebook page that the shooter was believed to have left the county. Residents were being asked to stay inside until the man is apprehended, KTRK reported.

Title: Mechanic recalls client driving car 'gas down' towards him
Body: A mechanic has recounted how one of his clients tried to run him over twice in quick succession, forcing him to first step aside and later leap onto the car’s bonnet as it sped towards him.  He also claimed that the accused’s brother offered him €10,000 the following day if he agreed to drop charges.  The incident happened following a heated argument between the two men in Cospicua earlier this month and led to the arrest of Zven Azzopardi, a 19-year-old Gudja shop owner. Azzopardi was subsequently arraigned and charged with violently threatening his alleged victim, causing him to fear violence and a string of other offences related to the incident.  He was denied bail upon arraignment after pleading not guilty.  When proceedings against him continued, a court heard from his alleged victim, mechanic Joseph Debono. Debono recalled how Azzopardi had brought two vehicles that needed repair to his garage in a Cospicua alley.  Then one evening, around 9:00pm, some two weeks before the final incident, Azzopardi had turned up outside his home, shouting, swearing and challenging him to fight. Debono said he told him to “go away and leave me in peace.”  Two days later, Azzopardi called him, telling him to get the repairs done. Other calls ensued and the two argued over a caravan and a motorcycle which Debono had sold to Azzopardi. Then that Monday afternoon, Azzopardi turned up outside the mechanic’s workshop. “At first he said that the works were good,” said Debono. But when the two started arguing, Azzopardi began to find fault with the mechanic’s work. “Just take your cars, take them away from here and don’t give me anything,” Debono had told Azzopardi, parking both vehicles outside his garage.  At that point, the accused got into one of the vehicles, a Kia, and drove further down the alley while hurling insults at the mechanic.  He then turned and drove back “gas down” in his direction, Debono recalled. Had he not stepped away, he would have been hit, the alleged victim testified.  Minutes later, Debono faced another incident. Having driven out of the alley, Azzopardi returned while the mechanic was still standing outside. As the speeding vehicle approached, Debono flung himself onto the bonnet, smashing the car’s windscreen with his hand.  Debono later filed a police report, claiming that Azzopardi had also held a revolver in his direction.  He told the court that the day after that incident, Azzopardi’s brother, Burton, had approached him while he was working outside the garage, offering him €10,000 to drop charges against Zven. However, Debono turned down the offer, saying that he “did not want to make a fool of the inspector.”  The alleged victim also recounted that second incident in separate proceedings against Burton Azzopardi, 21, who was charged with attempted tampering with evidence.  The youth was out on bail over his alleged involvement in a gang abduction at Rabat last year. Azzopardi is one of several men facing charges in that incident, among them car dealer Christian Borg.  Following the mechanic’s testimony and that other civil witnesses, both brothers were granted bail during separate hearings this week. Magistrate Gabriella Vella, presiding over Zven Azzopardi’s case, granted bail against a deposit of €2,000, a personal guarantee of €10,000, daily signing of the bail book and under strict condition of not going anywhere at Cospicua except to the police station where he was to sign in relation to separate bail conditions.  Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, presiding over Burton Azzopardi’s case, granted bail against a third-party guarantee for €5,000, a curfew between midnight and 5:00am and daily signing of the bail book.  Inspectors Darren Buhagiar and Kurt Farrugia prosecuted in Zven’s case. Inspector Gabriel Kitcher prosecuted in Burton’s case. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Title: 'Fake': Sexual abuse claims at YMCA are unfounded, commissioner concludes
Body: Allegations of sexual misconduct at YMCA Malta have been deemed “fake” by the Voluntary Organisations Commissioner, who said the claims appear to have been part of a frame-up. Two YMCA employees - the worker named in the abuse claim as well as the organisation’s CEO - have now been reinstated. The Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations, Jesmond Saliba, announced the end of his office's investigation into the claims in a statement issued on Saturday. “These fake allegations aimed wholly to build a frame-up and directed towards character assassination of said victims,” Saliba said. Saliba had announced last March that he had received a report of sexual misconduct concerning a top YMCA official. He said at the time that he had also informed the police of the report. The claims were never made public, though they are understood to have focused on alleged abuse carried out by a staff member which was ignored by senior management.  Sources at the time had said the claim was made by a former YMCA staff member.  After receiving the abuse report, Commissioner Saliba had appointed an administrator, Charles Cassar, to run the NGO until an investigation into the allegations was concluded. Weeks later, Saliba said it appeared YMCA had all the necessary safeguards in place to handle such allegations. He also introduced new rules that require all registered voluntary organisations to report all allegations of abuse to his office. The rules are intended to ensure that all such allegations are communicated to the police. On Saturday, Saliba’s office said the investigation into YMCA was concluded. The statement noted that the original claim was made by a person with a “fake identity” and that investigators had concluded that the claims were unfounded. “No incidents of sexual misconduct were found to any ongoings at YMCA,” Saliba said. “An operational review carried by the OCVO also showed that YMCA has very good policies in place on several areas, including safeguarding issues, both in terms of taking care of victims and in terms of establishing the veracity of allegations.” “These measures and their effective implementation by the senior management of YMCA were key for the OCVO to re-instate the organisation’s compliance within a few days from when the serious allegations which resulted in a fabrication were received by the OCVO.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Dutch policeman charged over shooting at farmer protest
Body: Dutch prosecutors said Friday they have laid an attempted homicide charge against a police officer who shot at a tractor driven by a teenager during a protest by farmers last year. Police and farmers clashed in July as tensions boiled over about government's proposed plans to cut nitrogen emissions - including by forcing farmers to reduce livestock numbers, and even expropriation in some cases. Images on Dutch and social media showed how police officers at a roadblock at Heerenveen in the northern Friesland province on July 5 trying to stop a tractor before it drives past them. At least two shots can be heard before the tractor, driven by a 16-year-old boy races off. No injuries were reported. A bullet hole was visible on the side of the drivers' cabin following the incident. "Based on this investigation, the Public Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute the police officer on suspicion of attempted manslaughter," it said. The case will be heard by a special chamber of the Central Netherlands District Court, that deals with cases of police officers using force to carry out their duties, prosecutors said in a statement. A hearing date has not been set yet. Although Dutch police are armed with 9mm pistols, these are seldom drawn and used. Prosecutors also warned that a picture and the name of a police officer, circulating on online media, was wrongly being used. "This man is not a suspect in the case," prosecutors said.   Last month, a political party backing the farmers' protest won a massive victory in key provincial elections, throwing the government's environmental policies into doubt. The upstart Farmer-Citizen Movement (BoerBurgerBeweging), set up only four years ago, won the majority of seats in the Dutch Senate on the back of the farmers' protests. The Dutch protests garnered global attention and reaped international support, including from former US president Donald Trump and a host of far-right figures.

Title: Inmate ‘was on right track’ before dying by suicide, says ex-prison boss
Body: Former prison boss Alex Dalli testified that Kim Borg Nicolas Virtù, the inmate who died by suicide in 2021, appeared to be “on the right track” when she was placed inside a “multipurpose” cell after discharging herself from hospital. A doctor had certified her as non-suicidal, he said on Thursday. Borg Nicolas Virtù was found unconscious in her cell the following morning, on June 16, 2021, and died at Mater Dei Hospital on July 4. Dalli stepped aside as head of prisons in November 2021 after a series of inmate suicides. The following month he was appointed as the government's special representative in Libya.   Dalli was testifying in the case against two former prison warders, Annabelle Cauchi, 52, and Alison Vassallo, 42, who are pleading not guilty to involuntary homicide and committing a crime they were duty bound to prevent. He confirmed he had never received any complaints about either of the warders. Cauchi had been a senior officer at the Corradino Correctional Facility with a career spanning 30 years of service and her advice had often proved valuable.   He had listened to “lots of [recorded] telephone calls” between Borg Nicolas Virtù and her mother, where the inmate would urge her mum to “speak to Annabelle” to see to any particular request. As for Vassallo, a sergeant major, Dalli recalled that she used to play volleyball with Kim. “Whenever there was some argument with an inmate, it would not last long. Tomorrow is another day,” he added. Dalli said Borg Nicolas Virtù had not been “on his radar” since she had not caused any extraordinary trouble. She had received “lots and lots of help” in jail and registered significant advances. Her prison file showed a substantial drop in methadone dosage for her drug dependence, with levels decreasing from “40 to 14”. She was also visiting psychologists and care plan coordinators, but it was not yet her turn to enter rehabilitation. “She was really on the right track,” Dalli said. While waiting for treatment in hospital, she suddenly got up and ran away but was caught by her guard in the hospital corridor. Later that evening she discharged herself against doctors’ wishes and was escorted back to prison. Her warders later told Dalli about the inmate’s allegedly “belligerent and arrogant” attitude. Since that was during the COVID-19 pandemic, anyone returning from hospital was placed in isolation for a number of hours by way of a preventive measure. “So was Kim put into that cell because of the yet-unconfirmed report of her attempted escape or for COVID reasons?” asked lawyer Rachel Tua, appearing for the family. “Both,” replied Dalli.  RELATED STORIES  The “emergency cell” was a “multipurpose room,” furnished only with a mattress which could be thrown away in case the inmate tested positive for COVID. Kim’s guard was told to file a report about the attempted escape in hospital. “Yet you locked her up. Perhaps she would not have done this had she not been locked in there,” remarked Tua, adding that the cell was filthy, with urine and no water in the sink and toilet. “It was not even fit for a dog!” said the lawyer. “On oath, I can confirm that that day I did not inspect the room. So I cannot say if it was spick and span. But under my watch, the prison smelt of cleanliness and during the COVID outbreak, the place was disinfected on a daily basis,” replied Dalli. He said anyone placed inside that emergency cell was given water to flush the toilet. The reason why there was no running water was to avoid intentional flooding. Sometimes, even a mattress had to be removed because “[inmates] would literally chew it up,” he said, describing a number of “common incidents” among inmates. “Had I known what Kim was to do, I dare say that I would have left her without clothes,” he added. The parte civile lawyer questioned why the victim was given non-tearable clothes that day. Prison stores were closed at the time she was escorted back from hospital and they were the only clean clothes available at the time, Dalli said. Asked about previous ‘superficial’ scratches on the victim’s hands, he said these had not been reported to him, unlike more serious cases of attempted self-harm which were reported “on the spot”. Moreover, a doctor had certified her as non-suicidal. Dalli went through Kim’s file later, even by way of “an examination of conscience to see if [they] could have done things better”. Recalling the morning Kim was found unconscious, Dalli said he got to the cell within minutes of the discovery by a staff member who was so shocked that she had instinctively shut the door again and rushed away. The victim was immediately administered CPR even before an emergency consultant and nurses arrived, since all prison officials were trained in first aid. “Kim still showed signs of life.” At one point, the victim’s father was asked to leave the court room after lawyer Mario Mifsud drew the court’s attention to “certain gestures” he had made in the direction of the defence lawyers. Times of Malta was later informed that the lawyers had filed a police report about him. Inspector Paul Camilleri prosecuted. Lawyers Mario Mifsud and Herman Mula were defence counsel. Lawyer Rachel Tua appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Italian police arrest 'Ndrangheta mafia boss on the run
Body: Italian authorities on Thursday announced the arrest of a top boss of the 'Ndrangheta mafia after almost five years on the run, who featured on the police's list of most dangerous criminals. Pasquale Bonavota, 49, had been wanted since November 2018, after escaping an arrest warrant for homicide and mafia association issued by a magistrate in Calabria, in southern Italy. He was arrested Thursday morning in the northern port city of Genoa, Italy's carabinieri police said in a statement. Local media said he had been leaving the city's cathedral when arrested and was carrying a fake ID. Bonavota is considered the brains of the 'Ndrangheta's Bonavota clan, which includes his two brothers, based in the Sant'Onofrio area of the Calabrian province of Vibo Valentia. The clan also operates around Rome, and in the northern regions of Piedmont and Liguria, which includes Genoa.  The 'Ndrangheta is Italy's most powerful and wealthy mafia, controlling the bulk of cocaine flowing into Europe. It operates in more than 40 countries around the world.  It has successfully expanded well beyond its traditional domains of drug trafficking and loan sharking, now using shell companies and frontmen to reinvest illegal gains in the legitimate economy. Bonavota went on the run just after being sentenced by a lower court to life in prison for two murders committed in 2014 and 2004, of a lower-ranking member of his own clan, and a rival boss of a nearby clan.  That sentence was overturned in 2021 by an appeals court, while he was on the run. However, Bonavota was the last remaining fugitive suspect implicated in the massive case against the Vibo Valentia 'Ndrangheta that led to the 2021 maxi-trial against more than 300 alleged mafia members and their helpers. The trial is still ongoing.  In that indictment, Bonavota is described as being a leader who "took the most important decisions" along with other top 'Ndrangheta bosses, and "looked after the interests of the association in the Rome area and in the gambling sectors and drug trafficking". The arrest of Bonavota comes three months after the high-profile capture of Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro.  The Cosa Nostra boss had been a fugitive for 30 years.

Title: Rape victims have to ‘wait for hours’ for forensic examinations
Body: Rape and sexual assault survivors are often forced to wait for hours among other patients at Mater Dei Hospital before they are examined in their vulnerable state, according to doctors and an NGO that supports victims of crime. The issue was first flagged to Times of Malta by concerned doctors who spoke about the “urgent need” to address the lack of sensitivity and privacy in the way sexual assault and rape victims are being handled once they arrive at the state hospital. These views were backed by NGO Victim Support Malta which reported an increase in sexual assault referrals made to them through Mater Dei Hospital this year. To date, in the first four months of the year, VSM received 12 referrals, compared to 28 throughout 2022, and 11 in 2001. “We are not even halfway through the year yet and are already almost at half of the referrals which we had last year,” said Kyra Borg, who heads VSM’s Care for Victims of Sexual Assault. Apart from the 12 referrals from Mater Dei this year, VSM received 13 other reports that have been referred through other entities or self-referrals. Of the total 25 referrals received this year, 21 were women and four were men. A sexual assault or rape victim is first seen at the hospital’s Accident and Emergency Department. The case is brought to the attention of the most senior nurse and doctor on the floor, according to the health ministry. The relevant specialists are called in to give clinical input on the case, such as treating injuries and addressing the risks of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. If the case is reported to the police, the duty magistrate is informed and may trigger a magisterial inquiry, appointing court experts to collect forensic evidence. “While such cases are prioritised due to time-sensitivity and the psychological trauma involved, limb-threatening and life-threatening situations still take precedence,” the ministry said. Borg elaborated that women are directed towards the Obstetrics and Gynaecological Ward, while men are kept at the emergency department and treated with other patients. Once at the Gynae Ward, women must wait in the waiting area with other patients. “They are usually traumatised and confused and often needing to wait for hours. If the case was reported to police, there would sometimes be police and other professionals from the forensics section around them, which makes other patients curious what is going on. “Sometimes the police speak to them in the waiting area while there are other patients around, while at other times there is a private room available,” Borg said. The ministry said that every effort is made for the victim to be seen in a closed room where dignity and privacy can be ensured. “However, in view of the significant caseload at the Emergency Department at peak times, victims sometimes have to wait in the waiting area or outside the gynae admission room until they can be seen.” As far as possible, the clinicians, court experts and police involved coordinate so that the victim is only required to recount their version of events and undergo intimate examination once to minimise re-traumatisation, the ministry said. Apart from the medical care and examinations at hospital, the victim is offered the assistance of the 24/7 Care for the Victims of Sexual Assault service. VSM operates a full service to victims of sexual assault including psychotherapy, psychiatry, legal representation and family therapy. Through a Public Social Partnership agreement with the Ministry for the Family, Children’s Rights and Social Solidarity, VSM manages a handful of crises workers who are deployed to meet the victim to offer support. “This in itself, has not been an easy feat as historically, these crises workers have not been contacted, not allowed near the victim or contacted hours after the victim has made the report,” Borg said, adding that in recent months the relationship between VSM and Mater Dei Hospital has grown more cohesive as a result of consistent and regular meetings. Malta remains in breach of the Istanbul Convention that stipulates that every European country should have one established rape clinic per 200,000 inhabitants.  In the past, VSM has made a number of attempts, with the support of the Ministry for the Family to home a one-stop-shop for victims of sexual assault to include the lifting of forensic evidence and police interview along with the subsequent therapy and related services. But Borg said that once the health authorities got involved, the project was stone walled. The Health Ministry said it is working on extensive changes that includes two rooms for the assessment of cases of sexual assault, so victims can be seen in greater privacy and comfort. “This also means that any reviewing specialists giving input on the case will review the patient in this room, instead of the victim having to move from the Emergency Department to another part of the hospital. This has now reached an advanced stage. Training for Mater Dei staff on managing cases of sexual assault is also being prepared. “Due to the need to amend clinical pathways and inter-agency procedures, these updates necessitate a process of extensive stakeholder discussion and feedback,” the ministry said.

Title: Kenya starvation cult 'massacre' toll hits 90 as search paused
Body: Warning: Graphic content The death toll from a suspected Kenyan starvation cult climbed to 90 on Tuesday, including many children, as police said investigators were pausing the search for bodies because the morgues were full. The discovery of mass graves in Shakahola forest near the coastal town of Malindi has shocked Kenyans, with cult leader Paul Mackenzie Nthenge accused of driving his followers to death by preaching that starvation was the only path to God. There are fears more corpses could be found as search teams unearthed 17 bodies on Tuesday, with investigators saying children made up the majority of victims of what has been dubbed the "Shakahola Forest Massacre".   Kenya's government has vowed to crack down on fringe religious outfits in the largely Christian country. "We don't know how many more graves, how many more bodies, we are likely to discover," Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki told reporters, adding the crimes were serious enough to warrant terrorism charges against Nthenge. "Those who urged others to fast and die were eating and drinking and they were purporting that they were preparing them to meet their creator." The majority of the dead were children, according to three sources close to the investigation, highlighting the macabre nature of the cult's alleged practices which included urging parents to starve their offspring. "The majority of the bodies exhumed are children," a forensic investigator told AFP on condition of anonymity. An officer from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) also confirmed that children accounted for more than half of the victims, followed by women. Hussein Khalid, executive director of the rights group Haki Africa that tipped off the police to Nthenge's activities, told AFP that the cult appeared to require children to starve first, followed by women, and finally men. He said 50 to 60% of the victims were children, whose bodies were found wrapped in cotton shrouds. "The horror that we have seen over the last four days is traumatising. Nothing prepares you for shallow mass graves of children," he said.   Investigators told AFP they found bodies squeezed into shallow pits - with up to six people inside one grave - while others were simply left exposed in the open air. As the fatalities mounted, the DCI officer told AFP that search teams would have to pause their efforts until autopsies were completed. "We won't dig for a couple of days, so we have time to do the autopsies because the mortuaries are full," he said on condition of anonymity. The state-run Malindi Sub-County Hospital had warned that its morgue was running out of space to store the bodies and was already operating well over capacity. "The hospital mortuary has a capacity of 40 bodies," said the hospital's administrator Said Ali, adding that officials had reached out to the Kenya Red Cross for refrigerated containers. Kindiki said 34 people had been found alive so far in the 325-hectare area of woodland. It is believed that some followers of Nthenge's Good News International Church could still be hiding in the bush around Shakahola and at risk of death if not quickly found. Kenya's President William Ruto has vowed to take action against rogue pastors like Nthenge "who want to use religion to advance weird, unacceptable ideology", comparing them to terrorists. As the investigation unfolds, questions have emerged about how the cult was able to operate undetected despite Nthenge attracting police attention six years ago. The televangelist had been arrested in 2017 on charges of "radicalisation" after urging families not to send their children to school, saying education was not recognised by the Bible.  Nthenge was arrested again last month, according to local media, after two children starved to death in the custody of their parents. He was released on bail of 100,000 Kenyan shillings (€672) before surrendering to police following the Shakahola raid. Nthenge is due to appear in court on May 2. The Kenya Red Cross said 212 people had been reported missing to its support staff in Malindi, out of which two were reunited with their families. The case has prompted calls for tighter control of fringe denominations in a country with a troubling history of self-declared pastors and cults that have dabbled in criminality.

Title: Substantial rise in domestic violence reports recorded
Body: A total 3,295 people made use of various services aimed at aiding those experiencing domestic violence in 2021, data published by the National Statistics Office (NSO) says. This marks an increase of 12.9% over 2020. Out of the reports filed, 2,600 (78.9%) were women while the remaining 695 (21.1%) were men. The services used include emergency shelters for victims, helplines and support. According to the NSO, the main services used by victims were the Domestic Violence Unit (DVU) within Aġenzija Appoġġ and the Police Department. Domestic violence cases have taken on a sharper focus since the murder of mother-of-two Bernice Cassar who was shot last November. Her husband has been charged with the murder. Following her death, a court heard that Cassar had undergone a risk assessment after she filed a police report last May 8, alleging that her husband placed a knife against her neck. Her level of risk was judged by social workers to be medium. She was killed six months later. The number of people seeking domestic violence services has been on the rise for some time. In 2020, 13.8% more people used such services than in 2019. Breaking down service users by age and nationality, statistics show that over half of the total registered cases fell between the ages of 30 and 49 with the majority of cases (85.3%) involving Maltese nationals. While the majority of victims identified as female, 162 (94.7%) abusers were male with only nine women making use of perpetrator services.

Title: Investment firm fined for failing to carry out checks on 6,000 clients
Body: An investment firm has been fined €133,000 for failing to carry out anti-money laundering checks on 6,000 customers.  The Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU) said in a public notice that Trive Financial Services Limited had acquired over 6,000 customers transferred to it by a foreign institution.   According to the notice, the company failed to show the FIAU any evidence that it had carried out the necessary checks to ensure that the foreign institution’s anti-money laundering checks on these customers were in line with the requirements under local legislation.  The company also failed to show the FIAU that it had examined a sample of the 6,000 customers to check that everything was in order.  While the company claimed that it carried out the necessary checks whenever a customer sought to transfer funds, the FIAU said its review of the customer files confirmed otherwise.  “Indeed, in a number of instances no review of the customer’s identification documents, or proof of address had been logged, even if the company accepted or transferred funds on the customer’s behalf or else allowed customers to withdraw funds,” the FIAU said.  The FIAU said Trive Financial Services had also shown an “inability” to understand its business risks and carry out the necessary mitigating measures needed to prevent financial crime.  Furthermore, the company failed to update its business risk assessment to factor in the 6,000 new customers it acquired from the foreign firm.  Failures were similarly noted in the company’s efforts to identify the origins of their clients’ funds and wealth.  The company also did not have sufficiently robust measures to ensure that it can effectively monitor transactions carried out for and on behalf of its customers, the FIAU said.  As a result of the failures identified, Trive Financial Services agreed on a remediation plan with the FIAU to improve its compliance with anti-money laundering legislation.  The FIAU said the company could face further penalties if it failed to implement this plan by the stipulated deadline. Last month, a court declared that administrative penalties imposed by the FIAU are unconstitutional and in breach of rights to be tried by an independent court.  The court judgment is expected to be appealed.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Reform to cut criminal court delays, trim prison terms for early admissions
Body: Lengthy procedures in the criminal court that often stretch up to 10 years will be limited to conclude within a year, according to a new bill announced on Tuesday. The process, known as the compilation of evidence, takes place at the very beginning of criminal cases. During the process, prosecutors must bring enough evidence to convince the court to accuse the charged person of a crime. Currently, pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases are especially long but this law would drastically shorten them.   If approved as law, the bill would also remove a bureaucratic process known as the referrals procedure, under which the case file keeps shifting from the court to the attorney general’s office with six-week intervals. The law would also allow persons accused of crimes to automatically get shorter prison sentences when they admit to crimes early on in the proceedings. Admitting to crimes that carry a maximum of a life sentence could shorten their incarceration to 40 years. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard and retired judge Antonio Mizzi announced the reform during a press conference on Tuesday. It includes a multitude of proposals that attempt to shorten the length of judicial proceedings, a controversial issue that has plagued the justice system for decades.   Compilations of evidence often drag on for many years, with figures published by the government showing compilations for drug cases take an average of four and a half years to be concluded and those of other criminal cases stretch to an average of 10 years. Malta had emulated the British legal system in laying down the need for a compilation of evidence to take place before a criminal trial. Britain has since removed this requirement to speed up the legal process. Those accused of criminal offences can spend years attending court sittings before their case even reaches the trial stage. Minister Attard said the reform is aimed at shortening long court processes while respecting the rights of both the victims and the accused. The reform also proposes that victims of crimes have the right to "actively participate during proceedings". The new measures, however, will only apply to criminal cases that start after the law is approved. The law would also allow magistrates to preside over criminal cases that carry prison sentences of up to 12 years. Presently, they can preside over cases that carry not more than six years. And in cases when a trial is not required, magistrates would be able to decide to do away with the process of compilation of evidence completely. "Magistrates deserve to be respected for the responsibility they bear," judge Mizzi said. "Don't ever think that sending people to prison is an easy job. We're talking about people's freedom here, and we cannot afford to be unsure of the decisions we make." Prosecutors currently get 40 days to present evidence of crime in court, but the law would give them a one-time extension of another 30 days.    The law also incentivises guilty people to admit their crimes earlier on in the case. If they admit immediately, they automatically get a sentence shortened by two grades. If the crime carries a maximum punishment of a life sentence or if they admit to the crime at some other point during the case, they automatically get a sentence shortened by one grade. The law would also spare magistrates the obligation of signing on each and every sheet of paper of criminal proceedings, the volumes of which, in some cases, can be as thick as the height of a human person, judge Mizzi explained.   The law also requires a small amendment to the constitution - a proposal that necessitates two-thirds of MPs' voted to get approval. A number of the proposals were first put forward 10 years ago by lawyer and then-PN MP Franco Debono when he was pushing for a justice system reform. Among other things, he had insisted that the referrals procedure wastes a lot of time and should be removed.

Title: No bail for man found with over 40 sachets of cannabis and synthetic drugs
Body: A man found in possession of over 40 sachets of cannabis and synthetic drugs was remanded in custody on Tuesday. Nuhu Mohammed, a 33-year-old construction worker from Ghana, was arrested last Sunday by police who noticed his suspicious movements while patrolling the area of Triq Dicembru Tlettax at around 4.45 pm. The man was spotted in Ġnien Patri Felicjan Bilocca before running off when catching sight of the police. The officers gave chase and caught up with the man. The suspect’s hand was glued to his jacket as the police grappled with him and during the tussle, some sachets filled with a greenish substance fell out of his pockets. A search of his person yielded 40 more sachets of a similar greenish substance. He was arrested and read his rights. During interrogation, Mohammed first said that he was a smoker and that the cannabis was for personal use. But he subsequently admitted that he sold drugs to earn money so that he could pay for his trip back to Italy, prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa explained. She had pointed out to the accused that he was not even supposed to be in Malta since he had no identification documents. The man had explained that his passport and wallet were stolen when he arrived in Malta from Italy. Mohammed was charged with possession of cannabis in circumstances denoting that the drug was not solely for personal use or within 100 metres of a place where young people habitually meet. He was also charged with aggravated possession of synthetic drugs and disobeying legitimate police orders. The accused pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Alfred Abela, did not request bail at the arraignment stage even in view of the fact that the accused apparently had no fixed address and was living in Malta without the necessary identification documents.

Title: US man, 85, charged with shooting Black teen who rang doorbell
Body: Prosecutors in the US state of Missouri announced felony charges against an 85-year-old white man after he allegedly shot and severely wounded a Black teenager who mistakenly rang his doorbell. Ralph Paul Yarl, 16, was in critical condition after he was shot twice, once in the head, last Thursday night when he rang the doorbell at the wrong house while trying to pick up his twin brothers from a friend's home nearby. Outrage rose over the case throughout the weekend, after it was revealed that the homeowner had been released without charges following 24 hours in custody. However, on Monday, Clay County prosecutor Zachary Thompson announced that the homeowner, identified as Andrew Lester, 85, had been charged with one count of felony assault in the first degree and one count of armed criminal action, also a felony. His bail was set at $200,000. The boy's aunt, Faith Spoonmoore, said on a GoFundMe campaign that her nephew was a gifted student who dreamed of studying chemical engineering. Deadly shootings are a regular occurrence in the United States, a country of around 330 million people that is awash with an estimated 400 million guns. But Yarl's case has sparked a particular outcry as the nation continues to grapple with a long history of missing accountability for violence against African Americans. The White House announced Monday evening that President Joe Biden had spoken by phone to Yarl "and shared his hope for a swift recovery." Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a Sunday night press conference that the information at the time "does not say that it's racially motivated, that's still an active investigation." "But as a chief of police, I do recognize the racial components of this case. I do recognize and understand the community's concern." Charges were also filed Monday in a similar case in New York state, though the victim of the shooting Saturday night did not survive. Police in New York state said a 20-year-old woman, identified as Kaylin Gillis, had been fatally shot by a homeowner on Saturday night when she showed up with three others at the wrong address when trying to find a friend's house. "While they were leaving the residence after they determined that they were at the wrong house, the subject came out on his porch for whatever reason and fired two shots, one of which struck the vehicle that Kaylin was in," said Jeffrey Murphy, the sheriff of Washington County, where the shooting took place. The 65-year-old homeowner who allegedly fired the shots was arrested Monday and charged with premeditated murder, the sheriff said. Meanwhile on Saturday in the state of Alabama, four people were killed and at least 28 others, mostly teenagers, were wounded in a shooting at a birthday party.

Title: Trial of suspected drug trafficker starts
Body: A man who was found in possession of 25 kilos of cannabis grass during a raid at a Sliema garage almost five years ago started undergoing trial by jury on Monday. Catania-born Davide Bonanno stands accused of involvement in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, importation and possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that the cannabis was not intended solely for personal use. The Attorney General is claiming that Bonanno imported the cannabis grass from Sicily. In September 2018 a tip-off had alerted police to a cargo of food and other items that was being transported on a trailer from Sicily. The trailer was driven to a Siġġiewi garage belonging to the haulier who was not aware of the illegal contents. A couple of days later, on October 1, a controlled delivery was effected and the drug, hidden in packets of tissue paper, was transferred to a garage in Matthew Pulis Street, Sliema where two other Italian men helped Bonanno move the merchandise into the premises. Neither of those two had any idea that the pallet marked as “merce alimentare” (foodstuffs) actually contained drugs. Bonanno accepted the consignment and was subsequently arrested. The drug was later certified as cannabis grass with a purity of 7% and a market value that ranged between €250,000 and €700,000. The trial by jury is presided by Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja. AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Andrea Zammit are prosecuting. Lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace, as legal aid counsel, is assisting the accused.

Title: Abduction, bags stuffed with cash - inquiry into No Deposit Cars sought
Body: A number of clients of No Deposit Cars Malta Ltd have filed a formal request for a magisterial inquiry into the company and its directors over various alleged episodes including an abduction and mysterious bags of cash at the airport. Lawyers for the clients of the car hire and purchase company filed an application on Monday formally requesting the duty magistrate to launch an inquiry and preserve all the evidence concerning the raft of allegations. The applicants said they were willing to testify before the magistrate alone so that the court could confirm that what they were saying was clear and credible.  RELATED STORIES  In a lengthy application supported by documentation, the applicants’ lawyers listed fraud, involvement in a criminal association, aggravated theft, violence against private individuals, stalking and VAT evasion among crimes allegedly committed by the car company, its directors Christian Borg and Joe Camenzuli, as well as other associates including Luke John Milton, Thorne Mangion, Tyson Grech and James Spiteri. One of the applicants recalled an episode which took place while driving through Naxxar one day in March 2021. His vehicle was blocked by Milton and Mangion who forcibly dragged him out of the car he had acquired on hire purchase from the company. They drove off in his car, telling him that he was late on payments. Next day, when he turned up at the company's offices explaining that he had fallen back on some payments because of COVID-19 and lockdown, he was told that the “contract is now cancelled, go home.” The woman for whom that car had been purchased received a letter from Princess Holdings saying that she owed them “lots of money.” She was so scared that she went and paid the sum “up to the last cent,” even though certain payments were not owed. Another episode referred to in the application allegedly took place some six years ago. The applicants claimed that Milton and Borg had instructed two men, a Serbian and a Maltese, to kidnap a Maltese youth to force him into signing some bills of exchange. The two hitmen pounced upon the youth while he was walking in the street, dumped him into the luggage boot of their car, tied his hands and placed a cover over his head. The youth was taken to an Mqabba garage where he was tied to a chair, beaten and ultimately forced to sign 18 bills of exchange for €18,000. (In a separate case in January last year, Christian Borg, Thorne Mangion, , Tyson Grech were among five men accused of abduction, holding the victim against his will, stealing up to €1,000 in cash, stealing a mobile phone, criminal conspiracy and making threats beyond the limits of provocation.) In Monday's application, it was also claimed that Borg and his associates were allegedly involved in a criminal web that included unidentified officials from LESA and Transport Malta. That organization was behind a number of crimes including bribery, corruption and misuse of electronic equipment, the applicants’ claimed. Borg was also allegedly involved in a number of suspicious manoeuvres concerning “black bags, like garbage bags,” stuffed with cash, all euro banknotes. This allegedly happened after 2019 when Borg would turn up outside the airport in his black Land Rover, soon to be joined by his associate Grech. Black bags, stuffed with cash “definitely far above” the €10,000 statutory limit in terms of cash control regulations, would be transferred to Grech’s car. This suspect operation allegedly took place once or twice a week, claimed the applicants, linking that to alleged money laundering activity by Borg and his associates. The applicants drew a parallel to similar requests for a magisterial inquiry made by NGO Repubblika in relation to the Vitals deal and another one over alleged trading in influence in passport sales. The application was signed by lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Spain premier apologises to victims over rape law loophole
Body: Spain's prime minister on Sunday apologised to victims for a loophole in a landmark law aimed at fighting sexual violence that has allowed some convicted offenders to reduce their sentences. The law, dubbed "Only yes means yes", came into effect in October, reforming the criminal code in a bid to define all non-consensual sex as rape. But since then, at least 104 offenders have been released and another 978 have seen their sentences reduced, according to latest government figures.  In an interview published on Sunday in the El Correo newspaper, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that "I ask victims for forgiveness for these undesired effects". "I don't think any deputy, including those parliamentary groups who voted against the 'only yes means yes' law is okay to lower sentences of sexual aggressors," he was quoted as saying. "That's why I am asking for forgiveness."  Under the law, the lesser charge of sexual abuse was dropped and all violations were grouped as sexual assault, which carried stiffer penalties. The law simultaneously reduced the minimum and the maximum punishment for certain types of sexual crimes, and hundreds have applied to have their sentences revised. In Spain, sentences can be modified retroactively if a change in the penal code benefits the convicted. As a result, many of those convicted have seen their sentences reduced, provoking outrage in the country. The left-wing government has introduced modifications designed to close the loophole, which parliament is currently examining. "We will put a solution on the table to resolve these problems," Sanchez said. Spain is due to hold municipal and regional elections at the end of May and legislative polls at the end of the year.

Title: Alfred Sant in stark warning on corruption, low-tax regime and climate change
Body: Former prime minister Alfred Sant took to the stage on Sunday to offer stark warnings on corruption, Malta’s low-tax regime and climate change. Addressing the closing of the PL’s general conference, Sant said that the government's economic success would naturally lead to temptation for bribery, corruption and people putting their snouts in the trough. He said Labour should not make the same mistakes the Nationalist Party made while in government, by ignoring the problem or denying it even exists. Sant said people forming party of the Labour ranks should not see it as a career opportunity, bur rather use it as a platform to advance Labour ideals. “Ask not what Labour can give to us, but what we can give to Labour. No one is bigger than the party. No one is bigger than the country”. Sant also sounded a warning on Malta’s low tax regime, saying other EU countries were rightly fed up with the wealthy using the country to avoid tax. He said a common tax base would impact the financial services sector in Malta, which is a key pillar of the economy. On climate change, Sant said rising temperatures and sea levels have the potential to ravage Malta’s way of life. He said that to mitigate this pending disaster, measures at EU level will require sacrifices and big changes in the way the country is led. Sant expressed his confidence that prime minister Robert Abela is the right man to lead the country through these challenge.  He also paid homage to his “good friend”, former Labour leader Joseph Muscat. On the economy, Sant reminded how Labour’s core values were always about protecting the most vulnerable members of society. He said one cannot combat poverty and ensure social justice without taking care of the economy. The ex-PL leader, however, did not mince his words on the economy’s dependence on low-paid workers. “We must not forget the foreign and Maltese works on a miserable pay. It is a truth that our economy is dependent on low wages. This injustice must be fixed. No one should be forgotten,” Sant said.

Title: Indian ex-politician, brother shot dead live on TV
Body: Gunmen seemingly posing as journalists shot dead a former Indian member of parliament and his brother live on TV as they were being taken in handcuffs to hospital by police, authorities said. Atiq Ahmed, 61, who had been jailed since 2019 and was convicted of kidnapping, was answering reporters' questions late Saturday when he and his brother Ashraf were shot at close range, the television images showed. "According to preliminary information, three persons posing as journalists approached them and opened fire... The attackers have been held and are being questioned," police official Prashant Kumar said. The TV clip in the northern city of Prayagraj shows the assailants shouting Hindu slogans after the brazen attack.  The two victims were from India's Muslim minority but police did not say whether they were investigating a possible sectarian motive in the killings.  The brothers were deeply involved in India's criminal underworld -- the ex-MP was reportedly facing more than 100 different cases -- and press reports said the attackers were petty criminals. The pair were being taken to hospital for medical examinations and were surrounded by police officers at the time.  Local media reports said one of the gunmen was even carrying a television camera and another a microphone with the logo of a television channel. Several days earlier police in the same state of Uttar Pradesh said they had shot dead Ahmed's 19-year-old son and his accomplice in a shootout. Both were wanted in a case of murder. Scores of people facing charges have been killed in the state in recent years in similar so-called "police encounters", which rights groups say are often extra-judicial executions. Ahmed, who had been facing charges of murder and assault, last month had claimed in a petition to India's top court that his life was under threat from the police. Following his shooting, gatherings of more than four people were banned Sunday across the crime-rife northern state of 200 million people that is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. The shooting sparked outrage among opposition parties accusing the BJP of ruling by fear. Hundreds of politicians belonging to all parties across India have criminal cases pending against them, with poor Uttar Pradesh a particular hotspot. These include nearly half of government ministers in the state including the state premier, according to independent monitoring group the Association for Democratic Reforms.

Title: Priest told bank €10k deposit was repayment for cash given to entities in need
Body: Former Marsaxlokk parish priest Luke Seguna told a bank that two cheques for €10,000, deposited in his personal account, were repayments for cash he had handed out to an elderly parishioner to distribute to entities in need. HSBC bank officials had called the priest to ask about two APS cheques which had been deposited into his personal account, triggering further investigation into other transactions. Details about that bank-client correspondence were later requested by police who then charged the priest with misappropriating €500,000 given to him by some 150 parishioners over a 10-year span. Prosecutors claim those funds were intended for the Church. Seguna denies all claims of misappropriation and money laundering, arguing the donations were given to him personally. Many of his former parishioners have testified about their donations to him and the parish, insisting they did not consider themselves victims. The prosecution questions how Seguna could deposit thousands of euros in various bank accounts and own a collection of five motorbikes and two cars on a clergyman’s salary.  RELATED STORIES  The court has also heard about €148,000 that went to payment processing companies linked to three pornographic websites. After a “verbal quiz” to confirm that the priest was the account holder, the bank asked Seguna about two APS cheques totaling €10,000, Timothy Zammit, head of financial crimes investigations at HSBC, testified on Friday. He said Seguna explained he had given that amount in cash to one of his parishioners who would visit him in church asking for money. The APS cheques were repayments for the cash amounts Seguna had given to the parishioner. There was no corresponding withdrawal, since the €10,000 had been accumulated through monetary gifts. Seguna said he received cash gifts on his priesthood anniversary, birthday and also when celebrating weddings and other occasions. He preferred saving the cash at home since it was inconvenient for him to go to the bank’s Paola branch when the Marsaxlokk ATM was out of order. The bank always encouraged customers not to accumulate funds at home, Zammit pointed out. When checking other transactions concerning the priest, the bank had come across a number of online payments linked to a website, DDITServices.com, all for the same amount.   An online search showed it could be a scam. However, when Seguna was questioned by the bank, he said he knew about those credit card payments and confirmed he had effected the transactions when buying apps, posters and online videos. Faced with that confirmation by the client, the bank did not undertake further verification. The defence objected to questions asked by prosecutors about these transactions. Lawyer Matthew Xuereb argued that in line with EU case law, such personal private data could only be disclosed if proportional and necessary. Anything short of that could result in a breach of the accused’s right to private and family life. The prosecution’s line of questioning could impinge on the accused’s fundamental rights and besides, was not relevant to the charges at hand, added lawyer Jose’ Herrera. The court, presided over by Magistrate Natasha Galea Sciberras, took note of those objections and authorised the prosecution to proceed with questions about information contained in the bank documents presented as evidence. Following criminal charges and a freezing order issued against Seguna, the bank informed the client last October that his accounts were being closed and then sent him an exit letter. A digital forensic analyst tasked with extracting data from three devices seized from the accused’s possession testified that one was password locked while the iPad appeared to have been “wiped out”. Under questioning by defence lawyer Alex Scerri Herrera, the witness clarified that there had either been no data at all or any data had been wiped out. No assumptions were made one way or the other, added the witness. Another witness on Friday was a Marsaxlokk parishioner who helped out at a charity cake sale and sold lottery tickets during a fundraising meal organised by volunteers. Asked about her involvement, the woman replied, “Nothing! I never had anything to do with money.” She told the court she had simply shared a post about the fundraising activity and sold tickets at the event, handing over the money to another parishioner who was the organiser. The case continues in May. AG lawyers Andrea Zammit and Ramon Bonnet Sladden prosecuted. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera were defence counsel.

Title: Man arrested after burning ex-girlfriend alive on square in Peru
Body: A man who burned his ex-girlfriend alive on a town square in Peru has been tracked down in Colombia and arrested, the government in Lima said Wednesday. The man, Venezuelan Sergio Tarache Parra, 19, stands accused of dousing 18-year-old Katherine Gomez with gasoline and setting her alight on a central square in Lima on March 18. She had broken up with him days earlier. Gomez was admitted to hospital with burns to 60% of her body and died after six days of agony in a case that shocked Peruvians. Peru's interior ministry said Tarache would be transferred from Colombia to Peru to be tried. Security cameras had captured Gomez's attacker fleeing the scene of the crime, and Peruvian police offered a reward equivalent to $12,500 for information leading to his capture. An Interpol red notice had been issued for Tarache's arrest, according to Peru's consulate in Bogota. Peru, a country of 33 million, registered 136 femicides in 2022 and similar numbers in previous years, according to official data. In 2018, a man boarded a bus in Lima, poured gasoline on his ex-girlfriend Eva Agreda, and set her alight. She died days later.

Title: More women accuse France's Depardieu of sexual violence
Body: More than a dozen women have accused veteran French actor Gerard Depardieu of sexual violence, with some allegations going back decades, according to a report from French investigative news website Mediapart. The 74-year-old actor, long a star in France whose 1990 film "Green Card" turned him into a Hollywood celebrity, was already facing a charge of raping a French actress. Depardieu has, through his lawyers, categorically denied any wrongdoing. The Mediapart investigative website reported on Tuesday that 13 other women had come forward to accuse Depardieu of molesting them on the set of 11 films or series that came out between 2004 and 2022, or in locations off set. Contacted by AFP, the prosecutor's office on Wednesday said it had not received any new complaints but that their investigation was ongoing into accusations he had raped French actress Charlotte Arnould in 2018. The new accusations range from "a hand in underwear, on the crotch, on the buttocks or on the breasts" to "obscene sexual remarks" and "insistent grunts", Mediapart reported. Even when the alleged abuse happened on set in front of witnesses, when women complained, crews often laughed it off, saying it was just the actor's way, the investigative website reported. Arnould filed her complaint in the summer of 2018 when she was 22, saying she had been raped twice by Depardieu in his Paris mansion a few days earlier. The actor - a friend of Arnould's family who had known her since she was a child - was charged in December 2020 but not jailed. He has dismissed the charges as "baseless", and unsuccessfully tried to have them dropped last year. None of the 13 women have filed official complaints, Mediapart said, but three have given testimony to the judiciary. One of them, who asked to remain anonymous, said she did so "to help Charlotte Arnould" and break the silence on such incidents in the filmmaking sector. She told Mediapart she was an extra on 2015 film "Big House" when Depardieu suddenly slipped his hand into her dress and she "felt his fingers trying to... reach my knickers". After the 24-year-old pushed it back, "he became aggressive. He tried to get past my underwear... I understood he was no longer acting. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have succeeded," she said. Another woman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Depardieu repeatedly tried to grope her when she was working on set with him on the 2007 Edith Piaf biopic "La Vie en Rose". She said she was constantly having to brush him off but did not openly confront him as she feared losing her job. "I needed to work, to eat, so I kept quiet," said the former actress, who was 39 at the time. In 1991, Time magazine asked Depardieu about a 1978 interview in Film Comment magazine in which he described his rough childhood and was quoted as saying "I had plenty of rapes, too many to count". Asked if he had participated in the rapes, he told Time that he had. "But it was absolutely normal in those circumstances," the actor said. Depardieu later denied making the remarks and threatened to sue the magazine, but Time refused to retract the passage, saying the interview had been recorded on tape. As well as countless French films, Depardieu has also acted in global productions, including Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet", Ang Lee's "Life of Pi" and Netflix's "Marseille" series.

Title: Four inmates test positive for drugs after one of them returns from prison leave
Body: Four prison inmates tested positive for cocaine last week, shortly after one of them returned from prison leave, senior prison sources told Times of Malta. They said the inmate managed to smuggle cocaine on his return to prison and then distributed it to the other three inmates. Prison authorities ran drug tests when some officials suspected that the inmates were under the influence of drugs. Sources said other inmates were tested as well but only those four inmates' tests returned positive. Disciplinary action has been taken against the inmates, the sources confirmed. Questions sent to prison authorities have not yet been answered but, on Wednesday, Maltatoday reported that prison authorities said that no drugs were found on prison grounds and that this was an isolated case. They said that out of the 721 drug tests that prison officials ran since January, only these four tested returned positive. The issue of drugs inside prison has been a hot potato for decades. Former inmates say that for many years, drugs would seep into prison fairly easily, and drug dealing within prison walls was common. Some former prisoners even say that, at times, drugs were more accessible in prison than on the street. That seemed to have come to a halt in 2018 when a former army pilot, Alex Dalli, took over prison and instituted a regime of zero-tolerance for illicit substances. Inmates and officials alike admit that drugs truly and remarkably vanished from prison during his tenure, but the controversial boss also ran the prison with highly questionable tactics. After 14 inmates died on his watch in three years and an investigation called for an overhaul of the prison system, Dalli resigned. Sources also say his successor, Robert Brincau, sustained the zero-tolerance policy successfully before having to step down earlier this year, and the young, new chief who took the seat just over two months ago is striving not to lose the streak. Prison leave has also recently become controversial after it was revealed that one of Daphne Caruana Galizia's convicted killers - George Degiorgio - was granted a few hours of prison leave to attend a family baptism party escorted by prison guards. The law allows prison authorities to let inmates attend specific family events - like baptisms and marriages - for a maximum of 12 hours, but critics and Caruana Galizia's family argued Degiorgio should have never been allowed out, since he continues to face charges on other serious crimes and is said to have ties to criminal circles outside of prison. Drugs in prison remain controversial since most inmates in Malta's prison are serving time for crimes related to drug abuse, trafficking, or for other crimes related to drug addiction, such as stealing with the intention to buy drugs to sustain the addiction.

Title: Former teen idol alleges sex abuse by Japan music mogul
Body: A former teen idol on Wednesday said he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Johnny Kitagawa, the founder of Japan’s biggest boyband empire, in a rare public allegation against the late mogul. The talent agency Johnny and Associates, which was established by Kitagawa and has dominated the country’s showbiz industry for decades, did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AFP. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan, which hosted a press conference by the accuser, Kauan Okamoto, said the company also failed to respond to its invitations to comment. Kitagawa died of a stroke aged 87 in 2019, having engineered the birth of J-pop mega-groups including SMAP, TOKIO and Arashi, who amassed adoring fans across Asia.   His young recruits were known collectively as “Johnny’s Jrs”, and flocked to Kitagawa in the hopes of making it big in the lucrative J-pop industry. Japanese-Brazilian singer Okamoto said he was molested by Kitagawa “15 to 20” times during his four-year stint in the agency until 2016, starting when he was just 15 years old. He is one of the first people to publicly address Kitagawa’s long-alleged history of sexual abuse against young boys, a controversy that resurfaced after a recent BBC documentary. “I hope other victims will also come forward, all of them,” said Okamoto, who believes most of the “100 to 200” young recruits he worked with at the agency were similarly assaulted by Kitagawa. “I also want the agency’s top management, and Johnny himself if he were here today, to acknowledge what took place and make sure such things won’t happen again.” The musician said it was common for Kitagawa’s younger talents awaiting a mainstream debut to spend the night at his penthouse apartment equipped with a jacuzzi, bar and a karaoke machine. Okamoto, now 26, said the first time he was assaulted by Kitagawa, the mogul came into his bed and proceeded to touch his genitals and perform oral sex on him. He said Kitagawa gave him 10,000 yen (now $75) the following day, without specifying what the money was for.   Allegations of child abuse and sexual exploitation have surrounded Kitagawa for years, but accusers have mostly remained anonymous. The Shukan Bunshun weekly magazine in 1999 published a series based on accusations made by several boys managed by the entrepreneur. Kitagawa was awarded damages for defamation following the reports but the verdict was partially overturned on appeal, with the court ruling the magazine had sufficient reason to publish the allegations, according to Kyodo News. Kitagawa, however, was never criminally charged. And Okamoto said he had no plans to ask police for a posthumous investigation of Kitagawa. “Thanks to Johnny, my life did change,” he said.  “But I also believe what Johnny did – performing sex acts on me when I was 15 – and to the other juniors, was a bad thing.” The singer said there was a “general awareness” among the boys under Kitagawa’s management that rejecting his advances would hurt their chances of success, though the mogul never explicitly said so. Kitagawa’s words carried such decision-making power that “some juniors even said, ‘you have to be at his place to succeed’,” Okamoto added.

Title: Belgian MEP in EU graft probe released to house arrest
Body: A Belgian court agreed Tuesday to release a European parliamentarian charged under the so-called "Qatargate" graft inquiry from pre-trial detention, on condition he wear an electronic tracker.       The imminent release of Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella will mean former European Parliament vice-president Eva Kaili is the last suspect still held in custody awaiting eventual trial on corruption charges. Kaili's bail request will be heard on Thursday, when she will discover whether she will be allowed to return home to house arrest after four months in preventative detention. Prosecution magistrate Antoon Schotsaert, said the Brussels advisory chamber - the court that decides on the terms of detention - had agreed to release Tarabella, who was detained on February 11.  Tarabella's legal team confirmed they had learned he would soon be free, under electronic surveillance, and stressed he remains available to investigators and continues to deny all charges.   Tarabella and Kaili are accused of having used their influence in the European Parliament to push the interests of Qatar, in exchange for cash payments from a Brussels political network. The government of the Gulf emirate has denied any wrongdoing. The alleged leader of the graft network, Italian former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri has confessed to organising the payments, allegedly from agents of Qatar and Morocco, and is now cooperating with the prosecution.   Another suspect, Italian MEP Andrea Cozzolino, is being held under house arrest in Italy and is fighting his extradition ot Belgium. An appeal hearing is due in Naples on May 2.   Kaili's partner Francesco Giorgi, a parliamentary assistant close to Panzeri, was released with an electronic bracelet at the end of February. He and Kaili were among the first arrests in the probe on December 9 last year, when Belgian investigators seized 1.5 million euros in cash during a series of raids on residences in the Brussels area.

Title: Christian Borg, car companies claim 'orchestrated smear campaign' against them
Body: Christian Borg and his car-hire companies on Tuesday categorically denied  allegations made against them by a group of customers last month and said this was all part of “an orchestrated mud-slinging campaign” against them.  Princess Holdings Ltd, No Deposit Cars Malta Ltd, and their directors Christian Borg and Joseph Camenzuli, filed a counter-protest in court on Tuesday morning, rebutting all claims made by the customers. Some 26 clients had filed a judicial protest calling for a police investigation into alleged tax evasion and fraud by the companies from which they had bought their vehicles, also seeking to rescind the relative hire-purchase agreements. The protesting parties claimed that Borg and his businesses were involved in a criminal conspiracy whereby customers were forced or induced to pay hundreds of euro in fake fines through “fraud and lies.” They also claimed that the company would issue 1 cent receipts against payments amounting to hundreds of euro, thus implying that Borg and the company were defrauding the state. Others said that they made monthly payments for over three years but never saw the car which they were paying for. But Borg and Camenzuli, as directors of the two companies have now hit back at those allegations, saying they were “both factually and legally unfounded,” based on “generic” terms lacking precise information. The judicial protest, they said, made reference to “several” customers who were allegedly “forced or induced” to pay fake fines running into hundreds of euro, without specifying which customers or fines. Nor did the protesting parties produce evidence in support of their claims. On the contrary, Borg and his associates said they were producing a sizeable list of fines issued by LESA in respect of one of the customers who had signed the judicial protest. That list of contraventions, covering the period between June 1, 2021 and February 13, 2023, amounted to €2,388.88. The car company, they said, had to shoulder those fines because the relative vehicle was still licensed in its name although in possession of the protesting party who held it under title of “lease to buy.” And that was how it remained until the purchase price was settled in full. The customers had also targeted other alleged illegalities in the contracts including an obligation for them to accept that vehicles bought or rented from Borg or his companies would be fitted with a tracking device and under 24-hour surveillance. Borg countered that the protesting parties’ claims were contradictory since on the one hand they spoke of a contractual clause about data tracking devices, and on the other hand they claimed that such devices had been installed behind their backs. Moreover, Borg’s lawyers pointed out that such contracts were similar to others drawn up by “tens” of other car companies in a similar context. Whilst rebutting all allegations as totally false, both directors and companies said that this was “nothing but an attempt by the protesting parties to try to escape from their contractual responsibilities.” In fact, the companies had obtained an executive title against a number of those customers who had signed the judicial protest. One of those parties had even directly approached the company, dissociating himself from the protest which had been filed in court, explaining that his name had been included among the list of customers without his personal consent. It was truly shameful for those customers to allow themselves to be drawn into this “orchestrated mud-slinging campaign,” Borg and his companies countered. Whilst categorically denying all allegations, they held the protesting parties responsible for making a false report as well as for damages for defamation on a personal and commercial level. They also reserved the right to take any further legal action accordingly. Lawyers Giannella de Marco and Charles Mercieca signed the counter-protest.

Title: Five killed, including suspect, in Louisville shooting
Body: Updated with details 6.50pm Four people were killed and at least eight others injured on Monday in a shooting targeting a bank in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, according to US police who said the suspect -- believed to be an ex-employee -- died in the assault. P Police said calls had come in around 8:30 am (1230 GMT) for an "active aggressor" at the Old National Bank in Louisville, the largest city in the southern state, and that officers were on the scene within "minutes." Officers "encountered the suspect almost immediately, still firing gun shots," Louisville police deputy chief Paul Humphrey told a press conference, adding that the shooter had died at the scene. "We're trying to confirm if that suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or was killed by officers," Humphrey said. At least four other people were killed in the bank and eight were being treated for injuries at University of Louisville hospital, including two officers who were wounded in the exchange of gunfire, Humphrey added. Police had initially given a death toll of five, but subsequently clarified that that figure included the shooter. Two people were in critical condition, including one of the officers. "It is clear from the officers' response that they absolutely saved people's lives," said Humphrey. Police were working to identify the victims, as well as establish the shooter's link to the bank.  "We believe this is a lone gunman involved in this, that did have a connection to the bank," Humphrey said, adding that "it appears he was a previous employee." Humphrey reiterated that there was no longer an active threat and urged residents to stay clear of the scene during what was expected to be a long investigation, likely to go "into the night." The incident triggered a massive police deployment outside the Old National bank building. CNN reported that some people had been able to take refuge in the bank vault and lock themselves in -- contacting police from inside. Fox affiliate WDRB cited a witness saying she heard multiple gunshots and breaking glass while in her car at an intersection near the site of the shooting. "Gunfire erupted, like, right over my head," said the woman, who gave her name only as Debbie. "When I turned, I saw that one of the windows in the bank had been blown out," she added. Governor Andy Beshear tweeted that he was headed to the scene, adding: "Please pray for all of the families impacted and for the city of Louisville." The United States, a country of around 330 million people, is awash with some 400 million guns, and deadly mass shootings are a regular occurrence.  Efforts to tighten gun controls have for years run up against opposition from Republicans, staunch defenders of America's constitutional right to bear arms. The political paralysis endures despite widespread outrage over recurring shootings. In the latest illustration of the deadlock, two Tennessee lawmakers were expelled from the state legislature last week after staging a floor protest calling for tougher gun control, in the wake of a deadly mass shooting at an elementary school in Nashville. Monday's mass shooting in Louisville was the 146th of the year according to data from the Gun Violence Archive -- defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot or killed, excluding the assailant.

Title: Ahead of Trump court date, NY police 'alert' and 'ready'
Body: Policing the "city that never sleeps" is no easy task even on a typical day -- so New York law enforcement agencies are taking no chances ahead of Donald Trump's high-profile court appearance next week, bracing for protests for and against the first indictment ever of a former US president. The city's police department has ordered its 36,000 officers to be in uniform and ready to deploy next week, NBC News reported Friday, citing official sources. Asked by AFP about their posture ahead of Trump's arraignment, a New York Police Department (NYPD) spokesperson said Friday that "officers have been placed on alert," and stand ready to "ensure everyone is able to peacefully exercise their rights." Trump, 76, is to be booked and fingerprinted and have his mugshot taken at a Manhattan courthouse on Tuesday afternoon before appearing before a judge. While the specific charges remain under seal, the case brought by New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg is widely believed to revolve around a $130,000 hush money payment Trump gave a porn star ahead of his successful 2016 election. Protests on both sides of the issue -- which the president and his supporters have decried as "political persecution" -- are expected to grow in the city, raising fears of unrest. Trump supporters, including Republican member of Congress Marjorie Taylor Greene, have announced plans to protest outside the courtroom during his appearance. For now, the NYPD spokesperson said, there are "no current credible threats to New York City." 'Politicized judicial systems'  Outside Trump's eponymous skyscraper on Fifth Avenue, a dozen or so people had already taken position on Friday with signs and banners that said, "Arrest Trump" and "Tick Tock, Times Up!" Another sign read, "No one is above the law." A man in a Trump costume made an appearance, and took pictures with a couple of the former president's supporters, who carried a banner supporting his 2024 campaign.   Outside the district attorney's heavily guarded office, Susan, a 60-year-old lawyer who declined to give her last name, had no qualms about saying she supports policies that Trump espouses, although "I don't like his personality." The expected charges against Trump are overblown, at best "a misdemeanor, not a felony," she said. "This is ridiculous -- politically motivated. I am ashamed of this justice in America that looks like that of other countries with politicized judicial systems," she said. Earlier in the day, three friends from San Sebastian in Spain's Basque country passed by to take in the scene before heading to a tour of Chinatown. "It seems strange to us," 72-year-old Pilar Banos told AFP. "The fact that they will put him in the car with his head bowed gives him prominence and votes because it will seem like an injustice to many people." Trump has called the investigation a "witch hunt" and denied having any relationship with the porn star known as Stormy Daniels.  The next chapter in his legal travails will come Tuesday, when the court reveals the actual charges pending against him.

Title: Fact-check: Is crime really on the decline?
Body: A recent announcement that Malta’s crime rate has dropped to its lowest level since 2004 was met with surprise, with many arguing that this does not tally with their daily lived experience. Some took to the media to pour scorn on the data, whilst MPs raised the issue in parliament, asking why record drug hauls are not yielding more court arraignments. Official crime data is collected through the Annual Crime Review, a report published by the CrimeMalta Observatory, a body run by criminologist Saviour Formosa. The report sources its statistics from the National Police System (NPS), a centralised database that records each crime report received by the police. This is similar to the data collection methods used internationally, where local law enforcement agencies register crime reports within a centralised database that is then used to extract national data. Malta’s crime statistics have been collected in the same way for several years. Yes, data shows that Malta’s crime rate has dropped in recent years. However, this data refers to reported crime and does not capture instances of crime that go unreported. Just under 15,000 crimes were reported to the police in 2022, the lowest number since 2011, when 14,289 crimes were registered (excluding 2020, which was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic). 2005 was the single year with the highest number of crimes in the past two decades, with just over 18,500 crimes recorded. Using the population data presented in the crime review shows that this amounts to some 28 crimes per 1,000 people in 2022, the lowest since data started being recorded in 2004, aside from 2020. Examining the data against more accurate population data presented in the recent census reveals a similar trend, with the number of crimes per 1,000 people decreasing from just under 46 in 2005 to 34 in 2011 and finally just over 30 in 2021.   No, different types of crimes have increased dramatically over the years, whilst others have experienced sharp decreases. In general, violent crime - which includes crimes such as bodily harm, domestic violence and murder - has doubled, going from three to six crimes per 1,000 people between 2004 and 2022. This is largely due to the increase in domestic violence, which has risen from merely 116 cases in 2007, when it first started being recorded, to 1,830 in 2022. On the other hand, bodily harm has decreased slightly over the years, while the murder rate has remained broadly stable. Likewise, white-collar crime such as fraud, money laundering and computer misuse has gone from under one crime per 1,000 people in 2004 to just under four last year. The increase in fraud is particularly significant, growing from a total of 160 cases in 2004 to almost 2,400 in 2021, before shrinking to under 1,600 last year. Drug-related crime, including possession, trafficking and importation has fluctuated from year to year, experiencing spikes in 2017, 2018 and, most significantly, 2021, when over 600 cases were reported. Last year’s rate is broadly in line with that recorded in several other years since 2007.  The overall decrease in crime rate is primarily driven by a decline in theft, which has dipped from over 11,000 in 2004 to just 4,500 in recent years. Speaking to Times of Malta, Formosa attributed this gradual decline in theft to several factors, ranging from improved home security systems and CCTV coverage which reduces the opportunity for theft, to the disruption of international pick-pocketing rings which has seen reports of pick-pocketing plummet tenfold from almost 2,500 in 2016 to just 250 last year. Law enforcement authorities around the world sometimes also use court statistics to give a broader indication of the changes in crime from one year to the next. Malta’s court records show that there were a total of 11,933 criminal arraignments last year, a figure almost identical to the 11,877 arraignments in 2021. This would suggest that there are an average of just under 1,000 criminal arraignments each month, although these are not spread evenly throughout the year. In both 2021 and 2022, criminal arraignments dipped noticeably in the August, during which only around 500 arraignments were carried out in court. Criminologist Sandra Scicluna suggests that this might be the case, citing several reasons why some may be reluctant to report a crime they have suffered, including the possibility of further victimisation, the belief that it’s not worth their while to report a crime and the fear of not being believed or having their plight minimised. “We know that certain socio-economic groups are more reluctant to report. There could also be a cultural change happening. If foreigners do not feel understood by the police they are more likely not to report. We have seen this in some domestic violence cases where foreigners report.” However, both local and EU data suggests that the public’s trust in the police is relatively high. A recent NSO survey found that over half of respondents held a positive opinion of the police, far outweighing the 9% who view the police force negatively. Meanwhile, a 2023 Eurobarometer study found that 70% of Maltese tend to trust the police, a figure that is in line with the EU average. Scicluna also points to a phenomenon called police discretion, where police at a busy station “might not be entering all the crimes as they need to decide where to dedicate their time”. According to Scicluna, police discretion “happens everywhere” and is particularly common when it comes to petty crime. PN MP Joe Giglio touted this possibility in parliament, questioning whether authorities are “playing with the figures to fool people”. The possession of small amounts of cannabis was decriminalised in December 2021, allowing anyone over the age of 18 to carry up to 7g of cannabis without risk of arrest or confiscation. The data does show that there were fewer drug-related reports in 2022, particularly in terms of drug possession, which reached its lowest recorded level since 2007 following a spike in drug possession reports in 2021. While data specific to cannabis possession for 2022 is not yet available, Malta’s National Drug Report shows that there were 82 arraignments for cannabis possession in 2021 and a further 87 in 2020. This would suggest that even if 2022 saw fewer cannabis arraignments than previous years, this alone would not explain the decrease in drug-related crime or other related crime such as theft. Scicluna dismissed the suggestion that cannabis decriminalisation could have a significant impact on Malta’s crime rate, arguing that “marijuana is a rather cheap drug so we would not have seen a decrease in theft or fraud because of marijuana legalisation”. Formosa warned that it is too early to determine the impact of cannabis decriminalisation on crime statistics. Drawing a parallel with instances where legal amendments resulted in initially inconsistent data, Formosa said “before stating that the numbers decreased because of lesser enforcement based on legal changes I would wait for the next two years and watch those trends”. According to Scicluna, “people perceive crime according to their feelings, according to what they hear, according to what is reported in the media”. This could suggest that the perception of widespread crime is partly fuelled by more comprehensive news coverage of crime and criminal proceedings. “The more violent crime reported the less safe people feel.  We know that all homicides and almost all serious bodily harm is reported.  But we know that rape is often not reported. So the perception of the people is based on what they hear. The closer to home the crime reported the more people panic and feel unsafe”. Formosa echoed this, warning against a “moral panic” based upon individual crimes that, although shocking, may not be representative of a wider trend. "Crime changes as society morphs. Offenders seek new opportunities to commit crime, especially more serious crimes. As society changes there will be new opportunities for crime that the police need to be prepared for," he said.  Scicluna argued that while official crime statistics are crucial in understanding the state of criminal activity within the country, there is also a need to measure the degree of unreported crimes, known as the "dark figure of crime", through a Crime Victimisation Survey. “These surveys shed light on what is not being reported by comparing them with what is reported,” she said.

Title: Watch: Round of a-paws for Peter after four years of sniffing out crime
Body: After a four-year career that saw him uncover contraband tobacco, drugs and more than half a million euros in undeclared cash, Peter the customs sniffer dog, is enjoying retirement. The seven-year-old Irish Cocker Spaniel’s harness has been packed away and he spends his days enjoying belly rubs instead of helping to fight crime at Malta International Airport.  RELATED STORIES  But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t like to show off his skills. “We can either make him find this cigar or one of his favourite toys,” his new owner tells Times of Malta during a recent visit to meet the one-time winner of an Animal in Uniform award. Sitting patiently on his bed, Peter is put to the test. He sniffs the cigar and waits while his owner places it in another room under an artificial plant. “Find Peter find!” After sniffing in the kitchen, dining room and sitting room, it isn’t long until Peter finds what he was looking for, sits next to the plant and waits for his reward – a fuzzy yellow tennis ball. Peter sniffed out an impressive 84 hits in his career – a rate of almost two finds a month. Around a third were related to cash seizures and he has detected a total of €598,859 in undeclared cash.   His biggest hit involved intercepting €33,164 at the airport. He also sniffed out 150kg of tobacco and detected three narcotics cases – one cannabis and two cocaine seizures. Back in 2019, his name also hit the international headlines when The Guardian reported a claim that one of his finds was linked to the ultimate arrest of the alleged middleman in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder case. The story of Peter’s alleged role was never confirmed. During his strenuous career, Peter committed just one crime – stealing the heart of his handler.  “Peter spent half an hour looking at me, our eyes locked,” said his handler, whose name cannot be revealed for security reasons. “Eventually, when I joined the section and the trainer asked me which dog I wanted, without any doubt, I told them Peter picked me, not the other way around.” After a three-month training period and spending time together to strengthen their bond, Peter and his handler got to work. “The work we do is more of a passion, if you don’t like dogs, you cannot do this sort of work,” he explained. Customs dogs are not merely tools but are important members of the unit. An item furtively packed into the lining of a suitcase can be sniffed out by a highly trained dog like Peter in minutes. It would take hours for a human customs officer to open and search through bags before they would find the contraband.  According to his handler, Peter was loved by anyone who would meet him, aside from those whose undeclared cash or contraband he had sniffed out. “Whenever you see him, you fall in love with him. He wants to spend time with you and cuddle with you,” he said. “He has a very unique character.” Peter also has a trophy to prove his popularity. In 2021, Peter was a winner of Malta’s first Animal Awards. “That was definitely a highlight in our career,” his handler said. When asked what led to Peter’s retirement, he said dogs are not “machines” and, just like humans, when they are ready to stop working, they do.   Peter’s replacement at the customs department is one-year-old Dezerto, also known as Dez. The happy young Springer Spaniel is full of energy and curiosity, the best qualities any customs dog should have, according to the official customs dog handler instructor, Hilary Fenech. Fenech said that although, ideally, the dogs’ history and breed are known, any dog can become part of the eight-strong canine unit, if they have the drive. “We see this when we play a game of ball. When you see the dog’s energy and drive to play and retrieve, that is one of the most important things,” he said. Labelled ‘green dogs’, the animals begin their training at the age of 11 months and that is when they start training alongside the instructor for 12 to 13 weeks. Fenech said a dog will learn how to indicate his findings, obedience and who is the leader in the pack. A normal training session includes Fenech hiding a piece of a toy in concrete blocks or luggage and asking the dog to sniff it out. “This is all a game, you make sure that the dog is happy whatever he is doing, otherwise he will not work well.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Ex-porn star Stormy Daniels 'proud' over Trump charges
Body: Stormy Daniels, the ex-porn star embroiled in the sex scandal behind Donald Trump's indictment, said in a UK newspaper interview published Friday that the criminal charges show he is "no longer untouchable". Daniels, a 44-year-old former adult movie actress, told Britain's The Times that the indictment issued Thursday against the ex-president was "monumental and epic".  "I'm proud," Daniels said, in an interview the paper said was conducted from an undisclosed location in the United States. "Trump is no longer untouchable," she said. "The other side of it is that it's going to continue to divide people and bring them up in arms. He's already gotten away with inciting a riot, and causing death and destruction. "Whatever the outcome is, it's going to cause violence, and there's going to be injuries and death," she warned. Daniels, whose birth name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges she had sex with Trump in 2006, just months after his third wife, Melania, had given birth to their son Barron. A New York grand jury indicted Trump over a $130,000 hush-money payment made to buy her silence during his 2016 presidential campaign. The legal case relies on whether it counted as an illicit contribution to his campaign.  In predicting his indictment, Trump has called for protests and warned that it could lead to "potential death and destruction" for the country. In her interview, Daniels admitted to being frightened "for the first time ever" over the long-running case, "because Trump himself is inciting violence and encouraging it". She claimed that within hours of Thursday's indictment, threats of extreme violence and murder began arriving to her social media, email and phone. "It just takes one crazy supporter who thinks they're doing God's work or protecting democracy," she added.  RELATED STORIES  However, the one-time adult movie star revealed she would be willing to testify in court against Trump if asked, but noted that she had not been called to so far. "I've seen him naked. There's no way he could be scarier with his clothes on. "I'm not afraid, I have nothing to hide, and I look forward to telling everybody what I know." The New York investigation is the first to reach a decision on charges, out of three major probes into the ex-president. Daniels told The Times the indictment was a "vindication".  "But it's bittersweet. He's done so much worse that he should have been taken down (for) before." You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Police bust multi-billion dollar Brazil-Europe drug ring
Body: Brazilian and European police have busted a drug-trafficking ring that shipped more than 17 tonnes of cocaine worth billions of dollars from South America to Europe, authorities said Friday. After a two-year multi-national investigation, police arrested 15 suspects Thursday in a series of raids and seized more than €80 million in assets, said Brazilian federal police and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol). "In a significant victory for the war on drugs, law enforcement in Latin America and Europe have taken down one of Brazil's most active drug trafficking organisations inundating Europe with multi-tonnes shipments of cocaine," Europol said in a statement. The cocaine was produced in Bolivia, trucked to Brazil by a Paraguayan supplier and sent to Europe via two large shipping companies based in the Brazilian ports of Rio Grande and Itajai, police said. The drugs were hidden inside legal cargo shipments, then distributed in various countries on arrival, they said. Authorities in France, Germany, Spain and Paraguay also took part in the investigation, they said. Brazilian federal police began investigating the group in March 2021, after authorities in Hamburg, Germany seized 316 kilos of cocaine shipped from southern Brazil. The investigation culminated in Thursday's raids, in which more than 200 officers took part, seizing 87 properties, 173 vehicles and a plane across several Brazilian states and in the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion, police said.

Title: ‘After 22 years waiting, a court valued my murdered mother’s life at €62,566’
Body: The son of a woman who was murdered while carrying out her duties as a traffic warden has expressed disappointment and frustration after a court awarded €62,566 in damages.  Fortunata Spiteri was killed on August 10, 2001, when a person wearing a mask from the horror film Scream stabbed her multiple times while she was working in Għarb.   Two men, John Attard and Benny Attard, were convicted of Spiteri’s murder while a third man, Giuseppe Farrugia, was also named in the proceedings but died before they were concluded.  Spiteri’s husband, Joseph Spiteri, later took the three men to court seeking to find them civilly responsible for his wife’s death. The case was assumed by his son Marvic after John died in 2021.    In a sentence handed down by Magistrate Brigitte Sultana on Thursday, the court found John Attard and Benny Attard responsible for Sultana’s death and ordered their heirs to pay Spiteri €62,566 in damages.  In comments to Times of Malta on Friday, Spiteri, however, found the outcome to be disappointing when weighed against the years that his family has fought to seek compensation for the loss of his mother.  “After 22 years of upheaval, a court decided that the value of my mother’s life was €62,566,” he said.  “While I would say it's better than nothing, I don’t feel that justice was done. This was 22 years of going in and out of court, being constantly deferred and running after lawyers. Not to mention the years that Benny spent running around the country as if he hadn’t done anything wrong. That’s what I’ve had to live with.”  Spiteri said that he intends to appeal the decision as he feels that the damages that were awarded are not enough to make up for the ordeal that he has had to endure.  “There are people who are injured on a job site who have received better compensation,” he said. “We haven’t done anything wrong and yet the burden of their actions have all fallen on us. Why has it taken so long to come to a conclusion? Is it an appropriate amount to value the life of a human being?” During criminal proceedings, Benny Attard had told investigators that John Attard wanted to kill Spiteri for issuing too many fines. Attard, who drove a bus at the time, had felt that Spiteri was picking on him.  The two men had met on a bus and mutually agreed to carry out the murder.  Benny Attard testified that John Attard knew Spiteri would be in Gharb that evening and drove to the location with Benny’s sister Maria and a man known as Il-Ħaxxiex. Benny Attard was jailed for 30 years after admitting to his involvement in the killing. John Attard received a life sentence for the same crime and died in prison in 2020.  Following Attard’s death, Fortunata’s brother, Charles Galea, told Times of Malta he feared that the true mastermind of the murder would never be caught.

Title: Posts intimate photo of his ex, returns to jail after just two weeks
Body: A man has been remanded in custody for posting an intimate photo of his ex girlfriend online without her consent, just two weeks after being granted bail in a different case.  Lamin Samura Seguba, 37, who lives in St Paul's Bay, pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included breaching the conditions of a previous release, and threatening the woman.  Magistrate Ian Farrugia denied his request for bail due to the seriousness of the case and also because of the real danger that the man would tamper with evidence, especially since the woman had not testified yet.  Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri insisted that the Gambian man's laptop and mobile, where the indecent photos were stored, were being held by the police so there was no way he could tamper with the evidence.  But police inspector Omar Zammit said the accused had refused to provide the police with passwords to access the equipment.  The court refused the request and the man was remanded in custody.  Just two weeks ago, Seguba was granted bail after he was accused of smashing the windshield of a man's car during an argument. He was also charged with falsely accusing the police of stealing €20,000 and with damaging items at Mater Dei when he went into a rampage after waiting for too long to be seen by a doctor.

Title: Man has a change of heart after admitting fraud
Body: A man who stands charged with defrauding several people of more than €9,000 retracted a guilty plea in court on Thursday when he was given time to reflect.   Mark Mallia, 35, from Zabbar, at first insisted on pleading guilty but then changed his plea when asked to confirm it.  He was charged with defrauding several people of varying amounts when he duped them into paying deposits for the rental of apartments in Zabbar which were not even his. This happened in November last year. He was also charged with defrauding a cab company when he managed to access its online booking system. He was further charged with misuse of communication equipment.  Mallia paced nervously in the dock as Magistrate Ian Farrugia explained that his guilty plea could see him going to jail for a considerable time.  After the magistrate gave him time to reconsider his plea, Mallia consulted defence counsel Sue Mercieca and then said he was pleading not guilty to the charges.  He did not request bail and was remanded in custody.  Police Inspectors Darren Buhagiar and Keith Xerri prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Customers demand police investigation of No Deposit Cars, Christian Borg
Body: A group of No Deposit Cars customers have called for a police investigation into tax evasion and fraud by the company from where they bought their cars. In a judicial protest filed in court on Thursday, the 26 clients also asked the court to rescind the hire purchase agreements they had signed with the hire purchase company. The judicial protest was filed against No Deposit Cars, its parent company Princess Holdings and the company’s owner Christian Borg.  RELATED STORIES  According to the clients, Borg participated in a criminal conspiracy and forced them to pay more than €1,000 in contraventions. They asked for Borg to be investigated by the police for having “promoted, constituted, organised or financed an organisation with a view to commit criminal offences which are punishable by imprisonment for four years or more.” The clients also claimed that the company issued receipts of just 1c when they would have paid hundreds of euros, indicating that Borg and the company were defrauding the state. Some said they were paying for a car they had not even seen and had not yet driven. "Nobody can do anything to me because I have very powerful people backing me up," the clients alleged that Borg had told one customer who complained about Borg’s refusal to hand over the car’s logbook. “If the police stop you, tell them that the car belongs to Christian Borg and they won't do anything to you,” he allegedly said. The protest, signed by lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta, also called on the court to rescind the contracts which contain a number of clauses that they claimed were illegal and order the payment of damages. Among the illegalities, they said, was a clause that obliged them to accept that the vehicles they had bought or rented from Borg or his companies would be fitted with a tracking device and be under 24-hour surveillance. The customers said that they had not known about the tracking devices hidden inside the vehicles which they had only found by coincidence. On Wednesday, the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) was asked to investigate Borg and his car hire company over reports that it was making customers sign contracts accepting that their car may have a GPS tracking device installed. PN MP and consumer rights spokesperson Rebekah Borg said she asked the authority to investigate Borg's firm 'immediately' for an alleged breach of consumer protection rights. The story first emerged when Times of Malta reported that Christian Borg's car hire-purchase firm - No Deposit Cars Malta - makes customers sign contracts accepting that their car may have a GPS tracking device installed. It says the devices can then be used to track customers if the company suspects they have breached the car purchase agreement. Some 21 customers have taken the company to court for a range of complaints, including employing unfair terms in its customer contracts. Borg is facing separate criminal charges for allegedly abducting a man last year. Information and Data Protection Commissioner Ian Deguara had told Times of Malta that the data tracking clauses in the contract break data protection laws. He said the clauses are “absolutely abnormal... not acceptable... [and] very invasive”. He said the terms used in the contract run contrary to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, an EU law introduced in 2018 designed to safeguard personal data. Asked by Times of Malta about the practice, the MCCAA had said these terms “may potentially be deemed unfair”. But when a bitten customer sought help from the authority, he said they told him that although they can attempt to apply pressure on the company, previous attempts to do so have been unsuccessful.

Title: Consumer authority asked to probe Christian Borg firm over car hire contracts
Body: The Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) has been asked to investigate alleged kidnapper Christian Borg's car hire company over reports that it was making customers sign contracts accepting that their car may have a GPS tracking device installed.

Title: Illegal casino case falters over wrong address in charges
Body: A man accused of operating an unlicensed casino from a Marsa garage 12 years ago has been let off the hook over a technical error by the prosecution, which indicated the wrong address in the charges.  Raymond Schembri, now 60, was targeted in a raid by police who turned up at the unnumbered garage in Marsa one October afternoon in 2011.  Following that raid, Schembri was charged with operating an unlicensed casino, allowing the premises to be used for illegal betting without the necessary permit by the relative authority.  He pleaded not guilty to the raft of charges.  When the case reached the judgment stage on Wednesday, the court pointed out an error in the charges which the prosecution had failed to correct.  While the charges stated that the alleged illegal activities took place in a new street in Triq it-Tigrija, all prosecution witnesses referred to an unnumbered garage on a new street in Triq is-Serkin.  All witnesses described the raid, which took place at around 3.30pm on October 24, 2011, at the garage on Triq is-Serkin.  Citing jurisprudence concerning a similar error, but with respect to the time of the allegations rather than the place, the court, presided over by Magistrate Natasha Galea Sciberras, declared that the principle was one and the same.  In this case, the prosecution never corrected the error in the address.  Nor did it produce evidence to explain why the charges referred to that address when witnesses testified that the activities took place elsewhere.  Moreover, two of the charges were contraventional in nature and thus time-barred upon the lapse of three months.  In light of such considerations, the court pronounced an acquittal.

Title: Man accused of setting fire to a car in Qormi
Body:  Updated with arraignment details 1.45pm A suspected arsonist was remanded in custody upon arraignment on Wednesday after being tracked down as the person seen on footage wearing a distinctive headband torch at the site where a BMW was set on fire. Jonathan Zammit, 37 of Mosta, pleaded not guilty to wilfully setting fire to the car and also wilfully damaging another two vehicles. He also denied breaching bail conditions amd recidivism. The incident took place in Guze’ Duca Street, Qormi in the early hours of March 20. Prosecuting Inspector Mario Xiberras said CCTV footage was collected from the area and the police also received confidential information about the suspect who appeared to be living at the Marsa stables. The suspected arsonist was seen in the footage wearing slippers, jacket and a headband torch. The police searched his living quarters and found the slippers, jacket and torch seen in that footage, as well as two bottles of fuel. When arrested and interrogated, the man denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, Alessandro Lia, did not request bail at this stage. Magistrate Gabriella Vella upheld a request by the prosecution to issue a protection order barring the accused from approaching the alleged victims. The man was remanded in custody. AG lawyers Daniel Tabone and Joseph Camilleri Azarov prosecuted, together with Inspectors Mario Xiberras and James Mallia. Lawyer Alessandro Lia was defence counsel.

Title: Owners of Valletta PL Club property seek eviction, compensation for forced lease
Body: The owners of the building housing the Labour Party Club in the heart of Valletta have instituted court proceedings seeking eviction of the tenants and compensation for a breach of rights suffered through the forced lease.  In an application filed on Wednesday before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, the owners - a group of several families - explained that the premises on Republic Street had been altered by the tenants without their consent, changing the nature of the premises. In terms of the current legal regime regulating such protected leases, the owners are bound to renew the rent and cannot regain possession of the property. The real rental value of the property was also much higher than that to which the owners are entitled to at law, the applicants said. In light of such considerations, they argued that there is no fair balance between the interests of the owners and the general interest. Protection of tenants under the current legal regime signifies that the fundamental rights of owners are trampled upon.   Consequently, their right to peaceful enjoyment of their property in terms of Article 1 Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been breached, argued the applicants.  They called upon the court to declare a breach of their rights and to award them compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. Moreover, they requested the court to order eviction, citing a similar case concerning the Naxxar Lions Football Club where the court had declared that the tenants could no longer rely on the current laws to retain possession of the premises at Victory Square, Naxxar.  The case was filed against the State Advocate, the Labour Party and the Valletta PL committee. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta signed the application.

Title: Minister urges banks not to 'close the door' on reformed prisoners
Body: Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri has urged local banks not to "close the door" on reformed prisoners by refusing to open an account for them.  Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, the minister said a person he got to know while he was serving a prison sentence had undertaken great efforts to turn his life around after committing a crime.  However, after embracing the straight and narrow path by cooperating with prison officials and attending rehabilitation sessions, learning a trade and finding an honest job, the man was turned away after attempting to open a bank account.  "When I met him again after some time he told me, 'Have I made all this effort for nothing?'," Camilleri said.  The minister said that after making an effort to rehabilitate and rejoin society, people who have served a prison sentence should not be made to feel as if their efforts were wasted.  "What are we telling this man? That his effort was worth nothing and that he should go back and embrace the black economy?" he said.  "This person wants to work, pay his taxes, and maybe buy a house one day. He wants to do things that any person, even I myself, hope to do with their life. But unfortunately, he was met with injustice."  Former prisoners who acknowledge their unjust behaviour and pay their debt to society by trying to be good prisoners and make efforts to reform themselves should be incentivised to continue to lead a normal life, he continued.  Having a bank account is a basic right that former prisoners should be able to access in order to hold down a dignified job and continue providing for themselves and their families.  "I make this appeal to all of our local banks, let's not close the door in the faces of people who have made a mistake, because if we do, we will all suffer the consequences of sending them back to their old lives," Camilleri said.  The minister pledged in parliament that he would write to local banks to explore how they could work with the government to facilitate access to banking services for former prisoners who turn their lives around.

Title: Watch: Nashville school shooter planned to attack 'multiple' locations
Body: A woman who shot dead six people including three children at an elementary Nashville school on Monday had planned to attack several different locations, the US city's police chief said. The suspect left behind a manifesto that "indicates that there was going to be shootings at multiple locations, and the school was one of them," Nashville Chief of Police John Drake told NBC News in an interview, adding that officials also recovered a map of the school which detailed its surveillance and entry points. The police on Tuesday released images of the woman blasting her way into the school and looking for people to shoot at.    A former student at the school, the woman carried two assault rifles and a pistol.  Chief of Police John Drake named the suspect as Audrey Hale, 28. She was shot dead by security officers.  The suspect was "prepared for a confrontation with law enforcement," a police chief told reporters following the latest outburst of gun violence in the United States. US President Joe Biden in remarks soon after the incident again called on Congress to take decisive action to control gun crime.        © Agence France-Presse                  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Flamingo poacher spared jail, as appeals court rules bird is not endangered
Body: Updated 4.20pm with Birdlife reaction A poacher who shot down four flamingoes has been spared jail by a court of appeal, which ruled that the protected species is not endangered.  Miguel Zammit, 24, had been sentenced to a year in prison and banned for life from holding a hunting licence when a court last September convicted him of having killed the four birds at Qawra Point in October 2021. The incident sparked widespread anger and prompted the government to ban hunting in the area.  Zammit was arrested close to the site after an eyewitness reported the flamingoes being shot down and contacted the police. Investigators told the court that he insisted he had been aiming at a duck.  He filed an appeal after a court convicted him of the poaching crime and handed him an effective jail term.  On Monday, a court of appeal presided by judge Neville Camilleri relaxed his punishment. The court dismissed Zammit’s plea that there were other people in the area who could have been responsible for shooting down the birds and concluded that Zammit was clearly the one responsible. When delivering judgment the court observed that although the punishment appeared to be harsh, that alone did not mean that the court was to vary it.  The court made reference to Subsidiary Legislation on Conservation of Wild Birds Regulations which laid down a number of factors to be considered when assessing the seriousness of offences under those regulations. Those included the impact on the conservation status of the affected species, the protected status of the site where the incident takes place and the possible damage to the ecological balance in that area. The impact of the offence on the general public, the intrinsic value of wildlife, the socio-economic benefits of wildlife, the public interest and the potential quantum of the illegal gain were also to be considered.  Basing itself on testimony given during the proceedings and on data under the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species the court observed that flamingos were categorized as of “least concern.” According to the IUCN, bird species classified as being of 'least concern' do not qualify to be categorised as critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened.  The court thus concluded that the impact of such offences on the species was “low.” Since flamingos were migratory birds, their impact on the ecological balance in the area where the incident took place was low. It, therefore, struck off the jail term imposed on Zammit by the lower court and instead sentenced him to a one-year prison sentence, suspended for two years. The court emphasised that Zammit would be made to serve time, should he commit another crime within the period of his suspended sentence. Zammit’s lifetime ban on holding a hunting licence was confirmed by the court. In a reaction, Birdlife Malta CEO Mark Sultana said he found the court's reasoning to be confusing.  "While one can debate if a jail term was just or not, the reasoning the court gave today is rather baffling," he said. "A protected bird is protected irrespective of its status and just because it is not at risk of being extinct, does not mean that its protection, or the consequences of illegally killing it, should be less. I fail to see the logic. It’s like saying that stealing from a rich person carries a lesser punishment than if you steal from a poor person."

Title: Jeremie Camilleri threatened policemen after killing Pelin Kaya, court told
Body: The motorist who killed pedestrian Pelin Kaya before crashing into a KFC outlet in Gżira last January threatened to track down the policemen who arrested him, a court heard on Monday. He warned them he would not forget their faces and would “pay them back.”  Jeremie Camilleri had already been handcuffed and was being treated by paramedics at the crash site when patrolling officer sergeant Andrea Zahra got there shortly after being alerted to the incident at around 1.08am on January 18. The driver kept up his aggressive stance even after being tasered, so much so that doctors advised that he was to remain handcuffed for everyone’s safety. The man was dangerous and appeared to be acting under the influence of some illicit substance, Zahra recalled when testifying in criminal proceedings against Camilleri. Camilleri, 33, who holds French and Maltese citizenship, is pleading not guilty to the wilful homicide of Pelin Kaya, a 30-year old Turkish interior designer who was killed while walking down Testaferrata Street when the BMW driver ploughed into her before crashing into a petrol station and the KFC Gzira restaurant.   Zahra recalled the scene when he got to the incident. The victim, he said, was being treated by paramedics as she lay on the street. Doctors were applying a defibrillator but emergency specialist Michael Spiteri told police that there was a 99% chance that she would not make it to Mater Dei Hospital.  Camilleri threatened policemen, challenged them to a fight Further away from the victim, Camilleri was wrestling with police, trying to remove his handcuffs, whilst challenging the officers to fight. He even threatened to “find them” once it was all over. He would “not forget their faces” and would “pay them back,” police later recalled. However, they ignored his threats and got on with their job. The officer said that as Camilleri was taken to hospital, he kept up his aggressive behaviour and threats throughout the ride in the ambulance and even at Mater Dei where he also directed his aggression towards hospital staff. That was why it was safer to keep him handcuffed, explained Zahra who had escorted the ambulance to Mater Dei. Camilleri shouted at police and medical staff, hurling insults at a nurse because of her skin colour. It was only after an hour and a half after he was tasered that Camilleri began to calm down enough to be transferred to another ward. Asked by defence lawyer Alfred Abela, Zahra confirmed that Camilleri’s behaviour had swayed from hyper to low, but he remained aggressive all along.  PC Daniel Schembri said that when he went to hospital and introduced himself as an officer from the Homicide Squad, Camilleri, who was lying on a stretcher at the emergency department cut short any further conversation. “I will not talk to you,” he told him. Just then, the victim’s boyfriend arrived in hospital seeking news of Pelin. He had just flown in from Turkey and was on his way to meet her, as she was celebrating her birthday that day. It was not easy breaking the news that his girlfriend had died, the officer said. “He needed time to process that news.”    RELATED STORIES  The officer said that since the man did not speak English fluently, he had called one of Pelin’s friends to translate. She told police that earlier that evening Pelin was at her place celebrating her birthday and was to meet her boyfriend later. She was very excited and looking forward to his arrival in Malta so that they could celebrate her birthday together. The witness said he was also tasked with gathering footage from the crash site. That footage showed “something flying,” Schembri testified. Unfortunately that was later identified as being the victim. A LESA representative presented a speeding ticket from a speed camera issued against the BMW that night shortly after midnight. The vehicle was driven at speed through Birkirkara in the direction of Msida, said the official, exhibiting the speed certificate calibration as well as the speed camera image. The case, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, continues next week. Inspector Kurt Zahra prosecuted, assisted by AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett. Lawyer Alfred Abela was defence counsel.

Title: Russia opens criminal probe into ICC after Putin arrest warrant
Body: Russia said Monday that it had opened a criminal investigation into International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan after the court based in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin. "The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case against the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Ahmad Khan" and several ICC judges, the Investigative Committee said, based on their "unlawful" decision to seek Putin's arrest. Khan is being investigated on the grounds of "criminal prosecution of a person known to be innocent... and preparation of an attack on a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection," the statement from the Investigative Committee said. The ICC on Friday announced an arrest warrant for Putin on the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. The Hague-based ICC said it had also issued a warrant against Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's presidential commissioner for children's rights, on similar charges. Moscow dismissed the orders as "void". More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the February 24, 2022 invasion, according to Kyiv, with many allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes.

Title: Man walks free after prosecution fails to produce witness in 20 years
Body: A man facing charges of theft, fraud and circulation of fake currency, has been acquitted after his case dragged out proceedings for almost 20 years, their only witness being the prosecuting officer. Nazzareno Dalli was first charged in September 2004 after police traced him as one of the suspects allegedly involved in a series of thefts from fuel service stations in the south. His case was initially led by Ian Abdilla, who at the time was an inspector. Abdilla would go on to lead the police's economic crimes unit before being removed from that post and then suspended. The case against Dalli began when the economic crimes unit received reports about fake currency being used at automated machines at fuel stations. Three suspects were identified, one of them Dalli who was allegedly captured on stills from security camera footage from the Paul and Rocco station at Marsa.  A third party had also lodged a criminal complaint after allegedly being paid in false currency by Dalli, Abdilla had testified.  The suspect was charged with forging banknotes, possession and use of Maltese counterfeit money, fraud, theft of diesel and petrol as well as handling stolen goods.  In 2004 proceedings kicked off with Dalli pleading not guilty to the charges.  In February 2006, the prosecution declared that they had only one other witness to produce. But that witness did not wish to testify since he too was undergoing criminal proceedings. By September 2007, the situation remained unchanged and the stalemate continued up to 2012 when the court declared that it was granting one last deferment for the prosecution to wrap up its evidence. Yet, the status quo persisted until the court finally put off the case indefinitely (sine die) following the umpteenth fruitless sitting in November 2013. In 2019 the case was assigned to a new magistrate. A new police officer took over the prosecution and filed an application for the case to be put back on the court’s list for hearing. But in the meantime, that sole pending witness had passed away.  In January 2023, the defence requested the court to declare the accused’s statement, released in 2004 without any legal assistance, inadmissible in evidence against him. When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by magistrate Victor George Axiak, observed that this was “another classic example of unnecessarily dragged out proceedings” when the prosecution had only produced one witness in almost 20 years, namely the prosecutor himself. Other than that, the prosecution came up with an ongoing refrain, repeating over and over that the only remaining witness wished not to testify since criminal proceedings were still pending in his regard. The prosecution could have summoned other witnesses.  And even that single witness could have been summoned to make his declaration to not testify, openly in court. Instead, the prosecutor who was handling the case at the time persisted in such behaviour which the court tolerated until it finally put off the case indefinitely.  As for the accused’s statements, the court followed a line of established caselaw which declared inadmissible those statements released by a suspect without legal assistance prior to February 2010, when Maltese law did not yet grant such right to the accused in the pre-arraignment stage.   In light of the fact that the prosecution had produced no evidence, the court had no option but to acquit Dalli of all criminal liability.

Title: Why youths join gangs – Maria Mifsud
Body: The family is the most important agent of socialisation in our society, especially for children and adolescents. This process can be briefly defined as the way in which a culture’s values are transmitted from one generation to the next. If a culture values human life, that value will be transmitted from parent to child through this process. Other individuals, groups and social institutions participate in this socialisation process such as schools, peer groups, mass media and faith, among others. Adolescence is a period in which individuals explore different roles, personality traits and belief systems in order to develop their personal identities. An appropriate aspect of this exploration is the development of a peer group. However, it may be concerning to parents if their young son or daughter gets involved in peer groups that promote antisocial values such as gangs. An adolescent may seek involvement with a gang in order to feel the security of belonging to something greater than oneself. For parents or guardians to understand why their child is involved with gangs, it is important for them to be aware of the demographics and structures of gangs that are considered as risk factors. Let’s get into it. Risk factors for joining gangs can be the type of neighbourhood one lives in, family difficulties, school dropout or association with friends who engage in problematic behaviour. Adolescents may be interested in joining gangs because of their supportive features. They can offer a sense of confidence, individuality, family and connection to something greater than oneself. Gangs also provide an organised structure similar to that of a family, where there are smaller systems interrelated with boundaries. Gangs may also provide the adolescent with the protection and support that they lack at home. As a result, it is important to ensure the structure of the family is functionally stable so that adolescents will not feel the need to go elsewhere. Adolescents who involve themselves in gang activity are at a risk due to several factors that may affect their psychological well-being and family involvement.   Families who are aware of the risk factors leading to gang involvement and their psychological impact on the adolescent and family may seek help and support as a preventative measure. There are a number of things that can help. Given the stressors that certain situations can bring to families, parents may need support and guidance in order to provide a sense of stability to their children. Therapy helps families to shift their organisational structures, so that parent figures are placed in a position of leadership for their children. Engage children from a young age in healthy and extracurricular activities. Spend quality time with your children. Even when they may appear to be shutting parents out, stay in touch with their world and let them know that you care. Show your affection. Be a positive role model. Set the right example. Take a firm stand against illegal activity. Never accept money or gifts that may have been obtained illegally. If you do, you are indirectly giving them permission to engage in crime and sending them the wrong message that it is acceptable. Instil positive life skills. Children and adolescents who know how to handle peer pressure, resolve conflict and solve problems are less likely to become gang members. Explain the consequences. Talk to your child and teen about the dangers (to them and the community as a whole) of gang involvement. Increase parental supervision. Interventions should be done in conjunction with the greater systems in which the adolescent is involved as well, such as the school, the neighbourhood and the community. If the parents join forces and cooperate with them, they can help facilitate the boundary-making for the child to be protected, thus helping the parents feel empowered in the supervision of their child.

Title: Two people caught red-handed trying to steal from Cospicua establishment
Body: A hooded man and a woman also hooded, were caught red-handed by the police trying to steal from an establishment in Cospicua early on Sunday.T The police said in a statement the incident happened at an establishment in Triq San Franġisk at 2am. They had been informed of suspicious movements around the place so they went on site and realised that the establishment’s lock was broken. After taking all the required precautions, the police went inside and came face to face with a hooded man and a woman who were carrying some tools. The man is 31-year-old and is from Marsa, the woman is 29 and is from Żabbar. Both were immediately arrested and searched. A pen knife, a torch and cash, as well as other items, were found in their possession. While investigating, the police also found the car the couple were using parked at Triq it-Tlett Ibliet. In it, the police found some levers. The couple are currently being held at the police lock-up in Floriana for further investigations. An inquiry is being held.

Title: Victims of policeman accused of rape suffered 'fear and shame' say prosecution
Body: Th trial of a former police officer accused of rape and sexual harassment continued on Friday, with the defence's continuing closing arguments maintaining that the accused was "transparent and genuine" in his version of events. The prosecution in their rebuttal pushed back at the notion and said that it was a case characterised by "fear" for the victims.  The 33-year-old officer, who cannot be named by court order, stands accused of twice raping a female officer and sexually harassing her at the Msida police station where they both worked. He is further accused of sexually harassing another young female recruit on different occasions, including one time inside a police car while out on night duties and another time while waiting in the car outside the Valletta law courts. As the trial entered its closing stages on Thursday evening, the defence sought to poke holes in the prosecution’s case, casting doubt upon the veracity of the victim’s version of events as well as her character. The woman had testified that in spite of her months-long ordeal, she had filled in a request form for a transfer but never sent it.  When asked why that was so, the woman said that she feared that she might not get used to the change, prompting the judge to remark that such change would have been for the better.  All the witness could say was that she “didn’t know what to do,” defence lawyer Franco Debono said. Most of her former colleagues at the Msida station testified that the alleged victim was a rather difficult person, recounting a number of work-related episodes, with the only police witness to sing her praises being an ex-policewoman working at the Sliema station.  That officer had described herself as the younger woman’s “mother figure,” earning the label of “guardian angel” by defence lawyer Franco Debono. This witness had testified that the alleged victim was a team player and also described how, a few days before she told her about the sexual abuse, she had sensed a change in her. Yet, the alleged victim had not opened up with her “mother figure” first, opting instead to tell her male colleagues in Msida.  Details had also emerged about the female officer’s apparent involvement with other male colleagues, including one whom she had kissed. “It took five years to get her to state that she kissed the other officer,” said Debono, pointing out that during the compilation of evidence she had insisted that the two were “just friends.” The woman, Debono said, was “hard-headed” and appeared to “fear everything.” She feared asking for a transfer or speaking out because the accused threatened to drag her “before a board.” She also came across as highly suspicious of her colleagues, claiming that she was “bullied,” that the police corps offered her no help and that the Police Commissioner had not “even bothered to phone her.” Nor had she cried out for help when the instances of the alleged assault were taking place. “He [the accused] threatened me,” she explained.  As for the second victim, who evidently had a stronger character, the woman had made it clear that she would not have reported the accused had her colleague not roped her in, Debono continued. That victim, who was allegedly touched, kissed and offered a weekend break by the accused - who claimed to be “infatuated” with her after noticing her “bottom,” - had testified that she thought “that she could handle” the situation. The woman had felt in control and took the unwelcome advances in her stride, the defence said, and while she had spoken to a superior about it, she never meant to file a formal report.  It was only when her Msida colleague shared her experience that the recruit “re-evaluated the situation in a different light.” “However the danger of it all was that her colleague was not telling the truth,” argued Debono. “There is one truth. They [the victims] both told the truth,” AG lawyer Angele Vella hit back during lengthy submissions on Friday morning. “The keyword of this trial is fear,” the prosecutor continued, adding that victims who found themselves in such circumstances had to battle “fear and shame.”  This case unfolded in a scenario where alleged rape and sexual abuse were committed by a police officer against his colleagues inside a police station, a crime that the accused was duty-bound by oath to prevent, Vella stressed, reading out the oath for emphasis.  This was compounded by the fact that the victim found herself in a predominantly male environment and found little support from her male superiors when she tried to speak up.  When the victim's former male colleagues testified, all most of them could say was that things were "normal" at the Msida police station and that the only person who went against the grain was the "guardian angel" ex-policewoman, who took decisive action by reporting the alleged abuse.  The rest were part of a close-knit nucleus, each covering up for the other, then claiming to have been traumatized by the whole incident. “The victims were still traumatized,” said the prosecutor. The rape was aggravated by the fact that it was repeated, violent and took place inside a police station, therefore punishment should lean towards the maximum.  “The victim should never have suffered all this. The police station should have been secure,” Vella continued, driving home the fact that the victim’s career within the police force had gone up in smoke. The woman tried to hang on but ultimately resigned, unable to put up with the “labelling” and still struggling with the trauma of the ordeal. “Irrespective of the outcome of this trial, his plan succeeded.” The other victim, though stronger-natured, should never have been subjected to the sexual comments, the kiss, the touch and the accused’s unwanted offers for a massage or a weekend break. “You cannot touch a woman’s body at the workplace….it’s a crime, it’s unacceptable…The police officer cannot deem himself untouchable,” stressed the lawyer, sending out a message in favour of all those who faced such harassment. The trial will continue with a final reply expected from the defence. A judgement is expected next week.  Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera is presiding. The accused is represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Edward Gatt, AG lawyers Angele Vella and Darlene Grima are prosecuting with lawyers Lara Dimitrijevic and Stephanie Caruana appearing parte civile.

Title: President urges politicians and journalists to avoid hate speech
Body: President George Vella urged politicians, journalists and social influencers to avoid hate speech whether online or offline. Addressing a conference called Hate Speech: Challenged in Schools, Vella said hate speech concerned him “quite a bit”. “I urge politicians, journalists, social influencers, employers and people of prominence to always consider their words and actions,” he said. “In particular I urge you to avoid this type of language when it comes to politics.”   Vella's comments come hours after fiery exchanges in parliament, as the house deliberated on the PN's motion to condemn the hospitals' deal struck down by a court last month. The debate was characterised by heated exchanges and accusations.  Speaker Anglu Farrugia was forced to suspend the sitting after Prime Minister Robert Abela accused PN MP Adrian Delia of lying to the courts.  On Thursday evening, the Institute of Maltese journalists meanwhile noted that the level of respect towards journalists was continuing its downward trend as authorities and politicians continued to "denigrate the sector with certain comments targeting journalists". The IĠM addressed the issue in a statement condemning "despicable acts' outside parliament, urging the police to investigate a man who spat at ONE journalists. President Vella himself had called on Abela and Grech to stop a politically motivated hate speech in 2021. On Friday he warned that unity could not be built on fighting, teasing, disrespect and threatening words. This brings division, exclusion, and disgust. Hate should never win over mutual respect.” According to Maltese law, hate speech is a threat or insult directed at a member of a recognised minority group. It is punishable by up to 18 months in prison, along with hefty fines stretching into thousands of euros. Specifically, hate speech is classified as harmful or threatening remarks to attack a person on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability.  Hate speech is a predominant issue locally. According to a Eurobarometer survey in 2018, Maltese people were the most likely of all EU nationals to come across hate speech online. Between 2019 and 2021, the majority of hate crime reports filed with police were of a racial and political nature. Vella added that while people disagreed between them, respect should still be shown towards Maltese, Gozitans and foreigners who lived and worked here.  “We need to create a sense of empathy, love and respect towards one another through our words and behaviour. Even towards those whom we disagree with.” He said the island’s diversity and multiculturalism should enrich society, strengthen its values and create equity. Vella said the scope of the conference is to understand what hate speech means, understand the root of what causes such discourse and how it can be stopped.  “We know that most of the time, such hatred comes from a lack of education and information, but a lack of education cannot be used as an excuse for people to use hate speech," he said. Vella said while he believed respect should be taught from birth, compulsory education held an important role in the solution to hate speech: schools, especially at a primary level, must suppress jealousy and hatred among children, and sprout the seeds of diversity and tolerance. He said young children did not discriminate on colour, race or gender.  "Children make friends with everyone and play together - they do not insult one another. But as they grow up, they begin to absorb words and begin to distinguish between themselves." He said that while educators must be given the necessary information and tools to teach the dangers of hate speech, students must be given the space to understand what hate speech is and the damage it can cause to others.

Title: 'She is my girlfriend': Pelin Kaya's inconsolable boyfriend wailed at crash site
Body: A man who witnessed the aftermath of the Gżira crash that killed Pelin Kaya in January recalled on Thursday the anguish of a man who, wailing “she is my girlfriend,” begged for news of the victim who had just been rushed to hospital. The man - Kaya’s boyfriend - reached the scene after the 30-year-old Turkish victim was killed when a black BMW ploughed into her as she walked down Testaferrata Street early on January 18.  A number of eyewitnesses testified about the aftermath of that fatal episode when proceedings continued on Thursday against 33-year-old Jeremie Camilleri who stands accused of wilful homicide.  The accused was drunk and high on cocaine when he swerved onto the pedestrian, then hit the petrol station and crashed into the glass front of the KFC restaurant, court heard.  A Maltese Mazda driver, who that night was driving from Msida to Sliema recalled seeing the dark, crashed BMW, stones scattered across the street and a tall man throwing bricks at a woman on the pavement.  He called the police for help and headed home.  A Pakistani national who was working late and was heading to the Paul and Rocco service station to refuel said he suddenly spotted the accused shouting and kicking up a commotion. “That guy,” said the witness, turning and pointing in the direction of the accused seated at the dock. Someone had warned him not to approach the aggressor who was beating up people. A couple of bystanders tried to tackle him and restrain him. The witness also recalled a man who arrived at the scene later, asking people about the victim, crying: “she is my girlfriend". Police tried to communicate with him, seeking details that could help them identify the victim. But communication was hampered by the fact that the man did not speak English. That was when the witness intervened, calling a Turkish friend who helped to translate police questions. The victim had already been rushed to hospital and it was very difficult to break the news of her death to the man, who sobbed and banged his head against a table in grief. The witness, who had seen the victim, lying unconscious with blood on her face, said the alleged aggressor was "very hyper, very high and jumping”. He threatened that if police approached him, he would fight them. People looked on, some filming the incident, he said. The witness too had a video and was asked to produce a copy in evidence.  Another witness - a Moroccan national who was returning home after waiting in vain for several hours to get treatment in hospital - said he saw the accused attacking people, throwing rocks at them and “football cheering". The accused shouted “1, 2, 3 vive l’Algerie,” said the witness. He then saw the accused throw a sizable stone at the figure on the ground, said the witness as Pelin’s mother, sitting two rows behind the accused, wept in court, consoled by relatives. The witness saw the accused attack a black Peugeot vehicle at the corner of the petrol station and also took a video of the episode.  “We were all in shock. All in shock. I never saw anything like that in my life.” Another man was having a coffee break and was chatting to an employee at a nearby pastizzeria when he spotted a BMW approaching from the direction of Msida at high speed, crashing right opposite him.  “There was no braking,” recalled the witness, explaining that at first, he did not realise that someone had been hit. The driver got out and headed in his direction. “Give me water,” he told the man at the pastizzeria, then turned and punched a guy who happened to be washing his car nearby.  The BMW driver then began to bang on cars that happened to drive by, attacking drivers. He was very agitated and disoriented, recalled the witness.  Fearing that he might end up in some scuffle with the aggressor, the witness reversed his vehicle and parked further up the street, watching the scene at a distance as the accused continued the rampage. The man flung stones at people who tried to intervene to help the victim. He also threw a stone at the victim, added the witness, indicating the size of the stone with both hands.  At one point, the aggressor sat down on the pavement, doing nothing, as though he was waiting for the police. When the police arrived, they had to taser the accused and wrestle him to the ground.  At the end of Thursday’s sitting, the court, presided over by magistrate Rachel Montebello, upheld a request by the prosecution and authorised lawyer Martin Bajada as court expert to compile an audiovisual timeline of all digital data gathered in the investigation, including bodycam footage showing the state of Camilleri’s Lija home.  The case continues next week. Inspector Kurt Zahra prosecuted, together with AG lawyers Nathanial Falzon and Kaylie Bonett. Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin were defence counsel.

Title: Police officer's rape confession can't be used as evidence in trial, judge rules
Body: A statement from a former police constable in which he confessed to raping his colleague cannot be used as evidence in his trial, a judge has ruled in an unexpected move on Thursday.  The typed statement from the 33-year-old, given to his police interrogators in 2018, was read out in court on the third day of the trial. The former police constable denies raping one of his colleagues and sexually harassing another.  In the statement, he had said he was very sorry, adding that he realised the gravity of what he had done and confirmed the victim's version, confessing to the rape. “If I could turn back time I would not do it. I had time to think things over and I wish to apologise to her for any damages she might have suffered. I was going through a rough patch but that still does not justify what I did," the statement had said. However, his defence lawyer Franco Debono moved to strike the confession from evidence, saying that it was not legally valid because of a change in the law concerning how an arrested person should be cautioned.  When the law was amended in November 2016 to introduce the right to legal assistance during interrogation, the caution had also been changed.  The interrogation took place in March 2018, yet the caution read out and typed “in the smallest ever font size” on the statement was not in line with the 2016 amendment, argued Debono.  After a brief break, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera upheld the defence's request, declaring it inadmissible because police gave him a caution that was not the correct format according to law. The caution given to the accused included the inference rule, namely that whatever he omitted to state could lead to inferences against him. Police had thus restricted the accused in what he said.  That inference rule no longer applied in 2018. The court also observed that the caution had been written in small print which was "not at all appropriate". "This is not some disclaimer clause in an insurance policy," remarked the judge. "The court must do justice with both victims and accused," she said. "Neither must suffer because of any procedural defect. The scales of justice must be applied scrupulously." The defence then informed the court that the accused will not be testifying.  The prosecution had questioned such a request to remove the statement as evidence had not been made in the five years leading up to the trial.  Even if the caution was not properly formulated, the accused had not been denied his rights to legal assistance and disclosure, argued Attorney General  lawyer Angele Vella.  “They claim that this is a matter of public order, but we claim justice for the victims,” said the lawyer, forcefully objecting to the removal of the statement.  “We are all here for justice. But how can justice be done if inadmissible evidence is allowed?” rebutted Debono.  In her decree, the judge said that prosecution must prove the accused's guilt and statements released not according to law are not admissible.  It's true that the defence could have flagged it earlier in the pre-trial stage, but the court cannot fail to lend an ear to the defence's argument, she said. The statement had been made a day after the accused had given a starkly different account in an audiovisiual statement.  During that statement, recorded in a small office at the Vice Squad in the presence of a lawyer who was assisting the suspect five years ago, the policeman spoke at length about how he first got to know his female colleagues, fielding questions about his alleged criminal wrongdoing.  The 33-year-old, who cannot be named because of a court order, said he met the female orderly some year or so before the allegations surfaced in 2018, when the two worked on the same shift at the Msida police station.  Their conversation was work-focused at first but eventually they began to speak about personal matters. She was a mother of a newborn and he was going through a difficult patch because of trouble with his girlfriend, he told police. During one of those conversations, the accused had asked her about her apparent “fancy” towards another male colleague whom he had observed during a social event organized among shift colleagues.  But she explained that she was not too impressed with the other officer. Then one day soon after that conversation, while washing his hands at the Msida police station toilets, he caught her smiling at him.  That was when he went up to her and kissed her on the lips, he said. He then led her to the sergeants’ room where the contact became more intimate and they each partially removed their own trousers before having sex.  The second episode happened during night watch.  Another officer who was on duty that night had gone for a nap on the sofa inside the sergeants’ room. What followed was more or less a repeat of their previous sexual encounter, he explained.  Later, he and the alleged victim had discussed the matter and agreed to keep it a secret between them “so that no one would get hurt.” Asked about the second female officer, a 19-year-old newcomer at Sliema police station, the accused admitted that he was “somewhat infatuated” and was attracted to her. Asked about two particular incidents of sexual harrassment about which the teenager testified earlier on at the trial, the accused confirmed that he had joked about his hand slipping off the gear lever when she once sat next to him in the service car.  But he denied making physical contact. Nor had he offered her a massage on another occasion when she complained to him about her backache. He also denied inviting her on a weekend break, insisting that he had only suggested meeting up. He did not deny complimenting her about her looks.  His other female colleague with whom he said he had had consensual sex, once remarked about his attention towards the newcomer.  “Ħeqq! What’s wrong with that? She’s pretty, no,” he had replied. “I don’t know,” the alleged rape victim responded.  However, since the time of those allegations, everything had changed, the accused explained under interrogation. “I was going through troubled times and I was very weak. I gave in. I fell for her as anyone else might. But I feel nothing in her regard,” he said, when asked about the alleged rape. He said he was sorry if he hurt her by fancying someone else.  As for the other woman he had allegedly harassed, he was over her too because he had since patched things up with his girlfriend, he told officers. “I just wish to get on with my life and work. I don’t want this trouble,” he concluded. AG lawyers Angele Vella and Darlene Grima are prosecuting.Lawyers Edward Gatt and Franco Debono are defence counsel.

Title: 'I'll behead you in front of your father': Bernice Cassar's dad testifies
Body: Bernice Cassar's father told a court on Thursday that his daughter's alleged killer had threatened to behead her in front of him. Testifying in the compilation of evidence against Roderick Cassar, Joseph Cilia also said that a few days before the murder, the victim's daughter requested a birthday party in August, to which she replied: "I would probably not be around by then". Bernice Cassar was shot dead on November 22 in Corradino, with her estranged husband becoming the first person ever charged with willful femicide, an aggravated version of the homicide offence. He is pleading not guilty.  On Thursday, Cilia recounted how Roderick Cassar had called him on his phone twice after fatally shooting Bernice to inform him he had murdered his daughter. To make sure he had not misunderstood, Cilia called his daughter's phone. Roderick Cassar took the call, asking him: "Didn't I already tell you that I killed her?" That was when he fainted with shock. In his testimony, Cilia said Roderick and Bernice's relationship deteriorated over time, taking a turn for the worse at the beginning of 2022. The father received a call from his daughter on New Year's Day of 2022 during lunchtime. "She was crying and told me to go for her as soon as I could," he recalled. When he arrived at the couple's house in Qrendi, Cilia found a big mess, with broken plates and food spread across the floor.  When Roderick Cassar appeared and he asked him what had happened, the man replied: "I'm not like you... I'm a volcano", before grabbing his son and taking him into the bedroom.  The father said Roderick told Bernice she could go with her dad if she wanted to, but the son was staying with him. "He always used the son as a weapon to ensure Bernice returns home," the father said.  Afterwards, she told him the argument erupted when she passed a comment that she was fed up. She said Roderick had grabbed a knife and told her he'll use it to kill her.  "She spent the day with me and then went back home because of her son as she didn't want to leave him with Roderick," he said.  Cilia said that in March or April, Roderick started going out in the evenings,  returning home drunk or high on cocaine.  On Mother's Day in May, his wife told him that Bernice had not called for two consecutive days. She called her sister and while they were on the phone, Bernice turned up at her aunt's house crying because there had been another argument, this time because her husband wanted to go to Gozo with his family. When Bernice said she did not want to go to Gozo, he started to hit her in the head and pull her hair.  "He placed a knife against her neck. She urinated out of fear when he told her he'll slit her throat," Cilia recalled. After that incident, together with their children, she had gone to live with her parents. The first two weeks were quiet but then Roderick started calling her father to send her back home.  One day, Roderick turned up outside the parents' house, saying he wanted to apologise to her and to Cilia. However, Cilia told him he did not want to risk sending Bernice back because if something were to happen to her, it would weigh on his conscience, the man told Magistrate Joe Mifsud.  Matters escalated as Roderick Cassar did not want the children to live with the grandparents. He wanted Bernice to rent her own place but when she asked him to pay the rent, he told her he would pay for a stay at Mater Dei hospital.  In July, Roderick was hospitalised and when Bernice took the children to see their dad, there were some incidents outside the hospital. During one of the arguments, Roderick told her: "If I don’t get to enjoy my kids, no one will", the father testified.  "That statement preoccupied me a lot and we never let her go anywhere alone except to the therapist and to work - where he eventually killed her." Cilia added that Roderick often drew the sign of the cross on his wife's car windows and "would hit the car instead of hitting her". On the insistence of her lawyer, Marita Pace Dimech, Bernice Cassar had requested a protection order. "Towards the last week of her life, she was very scared. She reported him but nothing happened. "He posted 'revenge is a must' on the eve of the murder. He had told her he'll behead her in front of me," Cilia said. The father said his daughter had taken up her lawyer's advice to start compiling an affidavit with her life story. She had not managed to conclude it as her life was cut short, he said. Defence asks for public inquiry report At the end of the sitting, defence lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono asked the court to order the prosecution to present a full copy of the public inquiry into the death of Bernice Cassar. The inquiry was conducted by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia. The prosecution asked for some time to file a reply to the request and was given 10 days. Footage captured beating - expert Earlier, court expert Martin Bajada told the court he had been appointed to gather CCTV footage from cameras in Corradino and Qrendi. He said he also downloaded footage shot by a person who happened to be passing by on November 22. Bajada said the footage showed that the accused's car had stopped Bernice's car before he assaulted her violently and then shot her.  The case continues next month. Attorney General lawyers Angele Vella and Darlene Grima assisted Inspectors Wayne Camilleri, Shaun Pawney and Paul Camilleri.

Title: Man admits assault over missing cash later found in his own pouch
Body: A man was remanded in custody on Thursday after pleading guilty to seriously injuring a man from whom he was meant to purchase a van.  Leighton Farrugia, a 30-year-old driver from Qormi, admitted to seriously injuring Frankie Apap on Tuesday evening following a "misunderstanding" about cash he believed was missing from his pouch.  Times of Malta reported on Wednesday how Apap suffered multiple head injuries after he was attacked with a metal bar and spade at Bulebel industrial area.  Apap was selling his van to Farrugia when he assaulted him after accusing him of stealing his cash.  Apap suffered five head wounds, all of which required stitches and a rib injury that put him in hospital overnight.  Farrugia's lawyer, Ishmael Psaila, said the incident was "blown out of proportion" when his client thought he had missing money. The money was later found in another compartment of the same pouch. During the altercation, the van suffered €3,000 worth of damage. Two printers, four monitors and a coffee machine were also damaged.  Psaila told Magistrate Noel Bartolo that his client would pay for the damage. He also asked for a pre-sentencing report. His request for bail until the report is compiled was turned down by the court in view of the seriousness of the incident as well as fear that Farrigia would not appear in court.  Police inspector James Mallia prosecuted while lawyer Herman Mula appeared  for the victim. The case was deferred to May 8.

Title: European prosecutor ‘shut out’ of magisterial inquiries in Malta
Body: A European prosecutor is getting shut out of magisterial inquiries due to gaps in the way EU rules were implemented in Malta. European prosecutor Yvonne Farrugia said these implementation gaps, together with a lack of police resources, are slowing down the pace of investigations by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). Farrugia says she is pushing to ensure the necessary legal changes are made to allow for cooperation between inquiring magistrates and the EU anti-graft agency. At present, EPPO is getting shut out of such inquiries, which are carried out under a veil of secrecy, even if the case falls within its remit. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard presented a draft law to increase EPPO’s power in December, only to withdraw the bill from parliament the following month.  Multiple requests for comment sent to the justice ministry throughout last week went unanswered.  Times of Malta revealed last year how an EPPO probe into the €40 million Marsa junction project faced obstacles, as both the police and an inquiring magistrate refused to hand over data from murder suspect Yorgen Fenech’s phone. Fenech was promised €2 million in success fees for helping a Turkish bidder on the verge of bankruptcy win the Marsa bid. Farrugia says she is determined to oversee an effective office, ensuring that laws are not merely applied on paper. Malta has gone from zero EPPO investigations in 2021 to having Europe’s highest rate of per-capita probes. EPPO’s annual report, published this month, revealed that Malta ended 2022 with 14 investigations at the EPPO’s office over projects worth a total of €123.5 million. Three of those cases concern VAT fraud investigations of projects worth a total of €70.5 million. Four cases include cross-border investigations, another four concern corruption, two are about procurement expenditure fraud and one concerns money laundering. While expressing her satisfaction with the increase in investigations, Farrugia said she is insisting on further improvements, including a dedicated EPPO unit within the police.   She said it is no secret that the police need further investigative resources. Due to a lack of executive powers, EPPO’s two investigators, known as delegated prosecutors, are totally reliant on the police cooperating and carrying out their orders. Farrugia acknowledged that police investigators often have their own priorities and tasks, necessitating the need for a dedicated police unit to work on EPPO investigations. Last year, the EU’s chief prosecutor Laura Kövesi raised concerns that Malta was only supporting her office with words, “not with facts”. “I visited Malta, I had meetings with the national authorities and after two days it was very difficult for me to identify the institution that is responsible to detect the crimes because all of them said: It’s not me, it’s them.” Farrugia says that following meetings with the authorities, the problems identified by Kövesi have been addressed and a new cooperation agreement drawn up. The anti-fraud agency is a relatively new body, having only formally started operations in 2021. Malta intitially declined to join in 2017 but reversed its decision after an international spotlight was cast on the government’s failure to fight corruption after Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination.  It had said in October 2017 that the decision not to join the EPPO was based on “sound technical reasons” based on the principle of subsidiarity, where countries have a right to keep certain sectors under its control. Five months later, then justice minister Owen Bonnici announced a change of heart and Malta’s participation in the EPPO was formally approved in August 2018.

Title: Grieving family and friends of Pelin Kaya plant trees, unveil memorial in Gżira
Body: A memorial plaque has been installed at the spot in Gżira where Pelin Kaya was mowed down and killed in a horrific car crash in January, soon after the young Turkish woman turned 30. Kaya, an interior designer, was walking in front of Paul & Rocco petrol station in Gżira at 1am on January 18 when she was struck and killed by a black BMW. The car then crashed through the glass frontage of the KFC restaurant next door. Jeremie Camilleri, who was behind the wheel, has since been charged with her murder.   On Wednesday, family members of Kaya, along with Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manche, friends and members of the Turkish community also planted tree saplings and tulips at the locality's Independence Gardens. The mother of Jean Paul Sofia, the 20-year-old who was killed in a building collapse in December, was also present during the planting.   Friends and family faced strong winds, grabbed shovels and planted the saplings. Olive, lemon, orange, and mandarin trees were planted in Kaya's memory.  In February, an oak tree that was planted in the Ta’ Xbiex public gardens in memory of Kaya was uprooted by vandals.  Later, her grieving mother Çiçek prayed in front of a memorial plaque set up outside the eatery. Those present joined the heartbroken mother and an imam in prayer, as she kissed photos of her late daughter. Her sister Derya said she feels exhausted but remains strong and will continue to fight for justice: "we will see justice, I believe it". The prime minister's wife Lydia Abela was also at the memorial, where she spoke to Kaya's mother and sister.   Family members of Kaya first visited Malta days after her murder. They recalled that the young woman had felt safe living in Malta.  Her mother had also visited the site of her murder, and her office, hours before the compilation of evidence against Camilleri kicked off.

Title: Man 'attacked with metal rod and spade' as he tried to sell van
Body: A man has been left with multiple head injuries after he says he was attacked with a metal bar and spade in the Bulebel industrial area on Tuesday night.  Frank Apap was in the middle of selling his van to a Facebook marketplace customer when the buyer assaulted him, his lawyer Herman Mula told Times of Malta. The 40-year-old victim also posted pictures on Facebook of his injuries, telling his friends that he was "brutally beaten".  He suffered five head wounds, all of which required stitches and a rib injury that put him in hospital overnight, his lawyer said.  Mula said his client had advertised the van online.   When the prospective buyer showed up at Apap's factory, where the van was parked, the two chatted casually before a concern was raised about one of the van’s tyres, which was flat. As Apap began to change the tyre, the prospective buyer allegedly began accusing him of stealing the money that was going to be used to purchase the van. But Apap, reassuring the buyer that nothing had been stolen, urged him to check CCTV footage.  The two walked over to view the footage, however, Apap claims he was hit in the head with a metal rod that is used to pump car jacks. Disorientated, Apap was then assaulted with more items as the aggressor shattered two mugs over Apap’s head and smacked him with a metal spade. During the scuffle, one of Apap's CCTV monitors was also broken, the lawyer added. Mula said that following the assault, the aggressor took to the streets shouting, informing passersby that Apap had stolen from him. When the police and medical assistance arrived on site shortly afterwards, both Apap and the aggressor were still there. Mula said that while Apap was taken to Mater Dei Hospital to receive medical assistance for his injuries, the aggressor was questioned by the police.  RELATED STORIES  Mula claims that as the alleged aggressor spoke to the authorities, he allegedly pulled out the pouch of money that he thought Apap had stolen and began to show remorse. Mula said he has also been informed by police that this is a common stealing tactic, however, the odd nature of the incident and its timeline left the lawyer lost for words.  “I have never encountered something like this," he said. In a Facebook post, Apap thanked everyone for their support including the police and medical practitioners who took care of him. “I cannot respond or reply to everyone quickly, but thank you for the support that you are sending,” Apap wrote.

Title: Top mafia boss Maria Licciardi jailed 13 years in Italy
Body: An Italian court on Wednesday sentenced Camorra boss Maria Licciardi, one of the few women to lead a mafia clan, to almost 13 years in prison, media reports said. Licciardi, 71, known as "the little one" because of her small stature, was arrested in August 2021 while attempting to fly to Spain, apparently to visit her daughter. She was found guilty of being the leader of a Camorra clan founded by her brothers and handed 12 years and eight months in jail, ANSA news agency said. She took over the clan in the Naples suburb of Secondigliano following the death of her brother Gennaro in prison in 1994. Italy's interior ministry has also described her as a leading member of a group of families dubbed the Secondigliano Alliance, which is said to control a large part of the organised crime in Naples. She had previously served eight years in jail. Licciardi was the inspiration for the chain-smoking female mob boss in the TV series Gomorrah, according to journalist Roberto Saviano, who wrote the book about the Naples mafia on which it was based.

Title: Abner Aquilina laughs as court hears how he confessed to murder
Body: Abner Aquilina confessed to having murdered Paulina Dembska to his prison cellmates, a court heard on Wednesday. Aquilina reportedly “bragged and laughed” about how he had raped and murdered Dembska, recounting the January 2022 crime in graphic detail. He also told fellow inmates that he had secured a 20-year sentence as part of a plea bargain deal – something prosecuting inspector Jonathan Ransley staunchly denied when testifying on Wednesday. Ransley told the court that Aquilina appeared to delight in recounting the crime, in an apparent attempt to “impress new inmates”. Among other things, he had explained how he used a bandage on his arm to strangle her and also sexually assaulted her with a car key. The description tallied with autopsy findings, the prosecution said, and Aquilina was seen moments before the murder while holding a key in between his fingers. Aquilina told cellmates that he knew Dembska and said that on the day of the murder he had quarrelled with his girlfriend but stopped short of killing her because her father would have killed him, the court heard. He also reportedly scribbled details concerning the murder on his cell walls, a court heard. But when investigators got wind of that and ordered a search, they discovered that the cell’s walls had recently been whitewashed. As a female police officer searched his cell, Aquilina reportedly revealed his genitals, telling her “What are you looking for? Why not seize my penis as evidence, because that’s what was inside her.” That search was recorded using police bodycams.  Aquilina was arrested in Balluta a short while after Dembska’s body was found close to the Sliema promenade in the early hours of January 2, 2022, in a violent murder that shocked the nation. A court has heard that he confessed to the crime to arresting officers. The confession was recorded on police bodycams. He is however pleading not guilty to charges, with his defence seeking to have him declared insane. Testifying on Wednesday, inspector Ransley said police first got wind that Aquilina may have spoken about the crime to his cellmates on January 23. His cell was searched on February 2, after police spoke to two of his former cellmates. Inmates who shared a cell with Aquilina had also heard him vow to kill more people once released from jail. They once overheard him on the phone saying he would kill his mother and lawyer. A diary seized during that cell search, which opens by noting that it is the diary of “Abner the chosen one” and his “adventures at the forensic ward” also included references to “bad things happening to cat feeders”, the court heard. Dembska, a 29-year-old Polish student, was a cat lover who often spent time feeding strays. She was killed at Sliema’s Independence Gardens, a spot often frequented by stray cat feeders. While Ransley testified and recounted the details, Aquilina laughed hysterically while in the dock. His mother, visibly troubled, sat behind him. When the prosecution asked the court to minute the accused’s behaviour, the defence leaned into its insanity plea. “What do you want to minute? That he’s insane, confirmed by three psychiatrists,” argued defence lawyer Mario Mifsud. Mifsud said his client needed to receive treatment before he could face judicial proceedings. “And if he said he’d kill a lawyer, then the prosecution should inform the chamber of advocates, for the protection of its members,” he added. Justice must be served but treatment must be given to him too, stressed Mifsud. He said that Mount Carmel is much better than the forensic ward at prison, where Aquilina is currently being held. The case continues. Magistrate Mars-Anne Farrugia is presiding. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Lara Dimitrijevic are appearing parte civile. AG lawyers Anthony Vella and Darlene Grima are prosecuting together with inspectors Jonathan Ransley, Wayne Camilleri and Shaun Pawney.

Title: Policewoman describes repeated sexual advances by colleague
Body: A young policewoman who was allegedly sexually harassed by a male colleague, told a court on Wednesday that she had blocked his unwelcome advances and taken control of the situation, not thinking of taking the matter any further. The now-24 year old sergeant was testifying at the trial of the police officer, who stands accused of sexually harassing her and also twice raping another policewoman in 2018. The sergeant was a young recruit at the time, assigned as beat officer at Sliema police station. She said the first signs emerged during one night shift when she accompanied the accused in a police car to serve notice of summons after normal hours to a female prostitute in the Msida area. After they failed in a first attempt to effect delivery, they stopped near Manoel Island to book a man who was urinating in public and then proceeded on their way, planning to attempt delivery. She said that throughout that drive, the accused’s hand found its way to her leg, just above the knee, as she sat in the passenger seat, while he joked that his hand “slipped from the gear lever.” “My hand slips too….I’ll hit you,” she flung back, later recalling how she had taken those unwelcome advances in her stride. “He grabbed my leg. It wasn’t just a one-off accident. It happened at least three times,” she recalled. But matters did not stop there. Whenever she stepped out of the car, the accused would comment favourably about her bottom and he placed his hand on her seat so that she would sit on it. She would repeatedly hold herself up and order him to remove his hand. She tried to block his advances, saying that they were both on duty, both in uniform and she was still a newcomer to the corps. But his only reaction was to smile. Once back at the police station, she told her superiors about what had happened. “I thought I was handling it. I was a new officer. I didn’t want to get into trouble. I didn’t want to be labelled,” she said.  Soon after that night shift, the witness said she and the accused were  delivering files to their superior and ferrying another officer back from court to Msida station. While in the car, seated behind the accused, he occasionally slipped his hands behind the seats, touching her ankle. She told him to stop and saw him smile in the driver’s mirror. He again commented about her bottom when she stepped out of the car to deliver some files in court. When she complained of backache, he offered her a massage which she refused, saying that she’d rather get a professional massage. He also offered her a weekend break. “I didn’t give it much thought. I thought they were normal things I would come across on my shift. I just did my duty and went home,” she said.  The accused later showed her a text message on his mobile, renewing his offer for the weekend break, saying it “was not for sex but to get to know her better.” “Forget it,” she said. He looked at her and smiled. She said the accused had once kissed her cheek as she straightened her back after bending down to pick some items from a vending machine at the Msida police station. “Don’t do that again,” she warned, turning away and walking out of the room. “I had no interest in the man. My main concern was not to get into trouble, having just joined the corps at the time.” As for the other alleged victim, the officer said that the two had spoken when their shifts overlapped. To date, she still did not know any details about what allegedly happened to the other victim. “She just told me that he [the accused] had harassed her and she told me to be careful not to go through what she herself had been through.” She said the two could not be described as friends but just colleagues.  Under cross-examination, the witness described the alleged rape victim as somewhat “strange” and “aloof” keeping herself away from others on her shift. Work-related clashes were normal on shift and there was always a competitive streak. “You were roped into this story by the other alleged victim. Would you have been here otherwise?”asked lawyer Edward Gatt, handling the defence together with lawyer Franco Debono. “Up to those incidents, no. But perhaps as women we found courage in each other,” said the witness. The trial continues. Names were not published by court order.

Title: Student fined €15,000, handed suspended sentence over Ġgantija damage
Body: A student was on Monday fined €15,000 and handed a suspended sentence after engraving letters on a main Ġgantija doorway. Heritage Malta said the 18-year-old Italian student was visiting the site on a school trip. He was caught in the act by a security officer and the police were summoned to the site. It "unreservedly condemned" the "act of vandalism", saying the student caused "irreparable damage". The youth was arraigned during an urgent session in Gozo on Monday. He admitted to the charges brought against him and was sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for four years - the maximum period permitted by law. He was also fined €15,000. "Heritage Malta, having invested considerably over the past months in the enhancement of security at its museums and sites, voices its satisfaction at the timely intervention of the security officer involved in Monday's incident," the agency said in a statement.

Title: Barman claims he was attacked by customer, may face prosecution for false oath
Body: A man charged with assaulting a barman who claimed to have ended up bruised and sore for a month has been cleared of all criminal liability while his alleged victim faces the prospect of being prosecuted for taking a false oath.  Mohamad Altuoma was charged during a Qawra district sitting over the incident, which had taken place in the very early hours of February 7 at a bar in Triq l-Imrejkba, St Paul’s Bay.  Neil Bugeja, who ran the commercial establishment at the time, claimed to have been attacked by the accused who had turned up with his cousin, insisting on being served in spite of being told that the bar was closed. A couple of days before the incident, the same man had been turned away by the barman when he came along with a group of friends.  The party of friends would stir up trouble, the bar owner subsequently testified. On the day of the incident, the accused and his cousin had allegedly attacked him and a friend of his who happened to be present at the time. The onslaught had left him badly bruised, the alleged victim testified, describing how “all his ribs were purple and he was in pain.” The accused also chose to testify in the proceedings, giving a very different version. When he asked for a drink at the bar that night, Bugeja had allegedly turned him away, punching him in the face.  As he fell down, the alleged victim grabbed a chair and beat him with it.  After the incident, Altuoma headed straight to the Floriana health centre from where he was directed to Mater Dei Hospital where he underwent ultrasound tests. When discharged a few days later, he filed a police report, denying that he was drunk at the time of the incident or that he had attacked the barman.  On the other hand, under cross-examination, the alleged victim denied having punched the accused in the face and kicking him in the stomach.  Bugeja said that when Altuoma threw a stool in his direction, he had simply flung it back at him.  Considering the entire framework of facts and the parties’ conflicting accounts, the court deemed the accused’s version more credible.  If the alleged victim had truly been hit on the chest with a stool, why had he waited three days to see a doctor, asked the court. Bugeja had gone to a health centre only after being approached by police. A doctor certified that although the alleged victim bore no visible signs of injury, he was in pain when touched and “tender over the left sixth rib”. Contrary to what he had claimed about being bruised and barely being able to move for a month or so, Bugeja produced no evidence of such bruising, nor any X-ray results. Nor did he preserve CCTV footage from the night, saying it was cancelled after 48 hours.  If the barman had truly been attacked, then he had the best evidence in hand. However, he chose not to preserve it, observed Magistrate Charmaine Galea. When all was considered, the court concluded that Altuoma had likely not left the bar when told to do so, but believed that it was Bugeja who had attacked him and not the other way around.  That meant that the alleged victim had taken a false oath and consequently, the court ordered that the judgment was to be communicated to the Police Commissioner for any opportune action accordingly.  The accused was cleared of all criminal liability.  Inspector Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri were defence counsel.

Title: Homeless man who reduced elderly host's savings to €5 denied bail
Body: A homeless man, who allegedly robbed an octogenarian of thousands of euros after the elderly man welcomed him into his home, has been denied bail. Joseph Sciberras, 46,  was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to reducing his host’s bank savings to just €5.  The man, who works at a bakery, had been offered shelter by the elderly Żabbar resident after being kicked out of his family home and roaming from one address to another.  He landed under police suspicion when his host, aged “well over 80", turned up at the Żabbar police station to report suspected theft. The old man had tried, in vain, to withdraw money from an HSBC ATM. Thinking that there was something wrong with the card, he checked matters with the bank, only to be told that many withdrawals had been effected from his account.  Further checks confirmed that his funds ranging between €4,000 and €5,000, had been reduced to €5.  Investigations revealed that most of the withdrawals had been made at the BOV ATM at Mediatrix Place, Żabbar. Amounts of €100, €150 or €250 were withdrawn regularly between January 27 and February 18, explained prosecuting Inspector Darren Buhagiar, who charged Sciberras in court on Tuesday afternoon. When police asked the alleged victim about his bank card, the man said that he had lost it.  He said he was hosting a homeless man who, however, had denied taking the card. The homeless man had said his host had handed over his card.  When questioned by police, Sciberras insisted that the withdrawals had been made with the alleged victim’s consent.  Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft to the detriment of a vulnerable victim.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution who pointed out that the accused had been kicked out by his mother after quarrelling with his brother who suspected that the accused had taken his money.  Sciberras then changed his address three times.  The man had a drug and alcohol problem as well as a gambling habit, explained the prosecution. Moreover, the accused had abused the generosity of the victim who had offered him a place to live, argued prosecuting Inspector Kurt Farrugia.  Although the accused has since moved in with someone else, he still lived and worked close to the elderly man’s residence and therefore there was a real risk of tampering with evidence.  “The old man gave him a home but the accused exploited him, squandering his monies and abusing his genuineness,” argued Farrugia. The man’s legal aid lawyer, Martin Farrugia, rebutted that the prosecution’s comments about the unrelated family episode and his alleged lack of a fixed address were “capricious.” Bank data was preserved and the accused, still presumed innocent, could do nothing to alter those records.  After hearing submissions the court, presided by magistrate Elaine Mercieca, denied bail in view of the gravity of the crime and the fact that civilian witnesses, including the alleged victim who was a vulnerable person because of his age, were still to testify.

Title: Person caught defacing protected Għar Lapsi twice in just one week
Body: A person has been charged with defacing a protected Għar Lapsi site for the second time in a week, the Malta Ranger Unit (MRU) said on Monday. The suspect was one of two individuals seen burning and scattering chipboard, which releases toxic formaldehyde, at the protected Natura 2000 site in Siġġiewi on Sunday, March 5. He was caught red-handed just hours after he had been served with police charges for a similar offence also committed in Għar Lapsi just a week earlier. On February 26, rangers saw the individual together with another person empty a still-hot BBQ onto a Mediterranean thyme plant, in broad daylight. They are also alleged to have left behind a significant amount of litter and left behind a “large bag of garbage,” the MRU said in a Facebook post.   “They were aware of the charges when they came a second time,” an MRU spokesperson said. “It has become clear that education is not enough”. The spokesperson said the volunteer-run MRU has now turned to monitoring sites, a decision that involves “hours and hours of watching and waiting.” They thanked the police’s environmental protection unit for their swift response after rangers alerted them to the crimes. The EPU has already charged two people over the February 26 incident and will now issue further charges in relation to the March 5 one. In total, three people will be charged. Fines for littering fall between €150 to €300 yet, according to subsidiary legislature 549.40, those charged may receive an additional fine of €300 to €1000 “due to the historical and environment importance of the site.” The MRU is currently in the process of registering itself as an NGO, the spokesperson said as currently, “we are just a group of people who care about the environment.”  Its volunteers witnessed the environmental crimes while keeping watch at the site together with environmental activist group 7R Lifestyle Malta You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man who threatened to throw acid at ex, burn and shoot her, denied bail
Body: A man who vowed to throw acid at his former partner's face, burn and shoot her has been remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to threatening her. The couple had been in a seven-year relationship and had a young daughter.  Ever since breaking up in December, the man started sending his ex messages, threatening to harm her and her relatives, prosecuting Inspector Colin Sheldon told a court on Monday.  The man allegedly threatened to throw acid in her face and burn her.  She reported the matter to the police, saying that she also sometimes spotted the accused near her home when their daughter returned from school.  The final report was filed on Friday when the alleged victim went to the domestic violence unit with her lawyer Marita Pace Dimech.  The 39-year-old heavy plant driver from Żebbuġ proved difficult to track down and was placed on the police's wanted list over the weekend. He was eventually located, arrested and taken in for interrogation.  He admitted sending messages but insisted that it was "in the heat of the moment", adding that he never lifted a finger.  The man said he simply wanted her to hand back some earrings and other jewellery that he had gifted her. Once she gave back those items, he would never look at her again. On Monday he pleaded not guilty to harassment, insulting and threatening his ex, causing her to fear violence and misuse of electronic communications equipment. He was also charged with breaching bail and recidivism.  Bail was objected to in view of the fact that the alleged victim was still to testify.  The woman's lawyer pointed out that the accused had even threatened to shoot his ex.  Defence lawyer, Jason Grima, countered that the accused's threats were "all empty words", adding there was a long story behind the alleged messages.  The situation possibly escalated when the alleged victim acted out of jealousy, claiming that her ex was having an affair with his secretary. When arrested, he cooperated fully with the police, his lawyer added.  Besides, the couple no longer lived together and it was important for the accused to keep his job so as to pay for the child's maintenance, he said. After hearing submissions, the court, presided by Magistrate Victor George Axiak, denied bail, stating that objectively and at first glance, the court lacked peace of mind that the accused would abide by court conditions.

Title: Sexual abuse, slave labour: trauma of Maltese child migrants sent to Australia
Body: Following World War II, Malta was under extreme economic stress as businesses shut down and parents lost their jobs. The impact was felt heavily among large families. So a scheme was set in motion that would see over 300 Maltese children migrate to Australia where they would be brought up under the guidance of Christian Brothers. Three of those children were Raphael (nine), Manny (13) and Peter Ellul (15) – three brothers who found themselves on a ship to Australia in 1960, all of their belongings stuffed into a single suitcase shared between them. Who Would You Tell? tells their story in the first feature-length documentary directed by Dery Sultana, a Maltese filmmaker who moved to Australia.   “It was like a holiday,” Manny recalls of the siblings’ one-month sail. When they made port in the land down under, the boys were led off the ship “like we were cattle”. After a few weeks of separation when Raphael was sent to a facility for younger boys, the three were reunited in Tardun, in the middle of the sprawling outback to the west. Home to about 60 children and 12 Christian Brothers, Manny estimates, St Mary’s College would be the boys’ ‘sanctuary’ for the coming years. The intended programme would see them learn English and the skills to become a farmer. “[You] couldn’t speak your native tongue because if you did, you got belted for it,” Raphael says. Not only were they punished for speaking Maltese but were left behind in their education as all lessons were taught in English, with none of the Elluls able to speak it and no one teaching it. Meanwhile, their ‘education’ saw them worked to the bone. “It was absolutely slave labour,” says Manny. His workday on the farm started at 7am and finished at 9pm, and that did not include morning chores for the college such as chopping wood.   In 1959, rumours of abuse began reaching Maltese shores, which prompted Mgr Philip Calleja, the director of the Emigrants Commission, to visit Tardun among other Australian institutes. While there, he was “surprised” at the foreign mentality as he saw boys wash together and sleep in massive dormitories, yet there was no abuse to be seen. Yet, like most things sinister, the abuse was hushed and hidden. Manny recalls the first night in Terdun: “I was lying in bed and I felt someone’s hand going underneath the blankets and trying to touch my private”. The 13-year-old pushed his aggressor off him in shock, which would make him a less frequent target for future attacks. Raphael was not so fortunate. “Compared to what Raphael endured, Manny’s abuse was vanilla,” Sultana said. “After 12, that’s when things started to change,” Raphael recalls as both he and Manny would become part of various sexual rituals. Brothers would push them up against walls, hold them down and even blindfold them. “They used to get children to masturbate… they used to make children masturbate other children,” Manny says. “There’s two things that I will never forget: he smelt, and his semen was very salty,” Raphael recalls, estimating that he was molested two to three times a week until the age of 15. Although many of the institute’s wards were going through the same experience, Brothers would tell them that it was “our little secret”. This contained each incident as children felt it was their duty to keep quiet. This, however, did not stop the two younger Elluls from speaking up. When Raphael approached a police officer about his molestations, the supposed protector smacked him. “He said to me, ‘Don’t you dare tell lies about those good Christian men, they’ve done nothing but help ya’.”   Yet, while Manny describes St Mary’s as “today’s prison”, Peter’s memories of his time in Tardun paint a different picture. “I had lots of energy and I worked hard and loved it. Best place I’ve ever been,” Peter said, one of the many differences in recollection that would eventually drive a wedge between the siblings. “It’s crap,” Peter says, explaining that any time he reads stories regarding sexual assault: “I reckon it’s been exaggerated”. Peter arrived at St Mary’s at the age of 15 – the same age Raphael was when his abuse stopped – and was, therefore, past the age that the college’s Brothers would prey on, Sultana explains. At the time of filming the documentary, Peter and Raphael had not spoken for over 40 years due to their differences. In fact, when Sultana approached Peter to be part of the film, he refused to be on camera, which led to Sultana getting on his knees and physically begging the brother to participate. “Yet again, I was hearing another story,” he said, so capturing Peter’s perspective of denial towards his siblings was a priority. “He represents the part of society that does not believe these victims, and he is part of the family. “I’m telling the story of these three individuals who literally came from the same place but ended up so far away from each other. Now, their lives are totally different.” In 2012, then-Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched a Royal Commission to investigate allegations of child abuse in the country. “These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject,” she said. The Commission lasted five years and during that time, the Commission handled 42,041 calls, 25,962 e-mails and letters, 16,000 individual contacts, conducted 8,013 sessions and made 2,576 referrals to authorities.  RELATED STORIES  Although both Raphael and Manny have received monetary compensation for their childhood, the trauma echoed through their lives – keeping the secret led to ruined marriages. “It’s history and I’m not going to lose any sleep over it because that’s how it had to happen,” Peter says.  Who Would You Tell? premieres on Friday, March 10 at 8pm at the Eden Cinemas in St Julian's. Tickets are available online. Afterwards there will be a question-and-answer session between theatre director and Times editor-in-chief Herman Grech and the documentary’s director, Dery Sultana.

Title: Police officer under investigation for kicking arrested man on the ground
Body: A police officer is being investigated after a video surfaced on the internet showing him kicking a man lying on the ground as he was being arrested, the police have confirmed. Sources told Times of Malta the officer has, however, not been suspended from his duties. The internal investigation could take up to two weeks and could lead to internal disciplinary action or even criminal charges being issued against the officer, they said. The incident was first reported by Newsbook after a video emerged on social media earlier this week, showing four police officers arresting a man in St Julian’s on Sunday.   The video shows three of the officers detaining him as he lay on the ground. The fourth officer stands by and, at one point, bends over and appears to be helping them but it remains unclear what he was doing at that moment. He then stands up and kicks the arrested man. The man was clearly lying on the ground when he was kicked and was likely being handcuffed because, seconds later, the officers pulled him off the ground in handcuffs. In reply to questions, a spokesperson for the police said the case was being investigated by the Professional Standards Office.  RELATED STORIES  The office is an internal unit within the police force tasked with investigating “complaints or allegations on matters of corruption, use of excessive force and the violation of the Force’s policies, procedures and code of ethics”. The sources also said that the relatively young officer who was seen kicking the man is in the process of being promoted to inspector. The arrest was made after the police received reports that a man was walking along a road in St Julian’s hitting cars, including a police vehicle. The suspect reportedly managed to flee and when police caught up with him shortly afterwards, he attempted to escape again and resisted arrest, the sources said. Video provided to Times of Malta shows the man throwing what appears to be a plastic container onto two separate police cars parked outside the St Julian's police station.    The man then runs away when officers emerge from the station. Three officers give chase on foot, with another three getting into one of the cars and speeding off in the man's direction.  The video uploaded onto social media was reportedly taken during the final moments of the arrest, when the man was being detained. Those events take place less than 100m away from the police station.  Three other young police constables stand accused in court of having kidnapped and beaten foreign nationals on at least three occasions. Also, two Transport Malta enforcement officers have been charged with a raft of crimes in connection with an assault on a man lying on the ground last October.

Title: Former Iraqi minister wanted to face charges over $2.5 billion heist
Body: Iraq's judiciary issued arrest warrants on Saturday for four former officials who are accused of facilitating the theft of $2.5 billion in public funds in one of the country's biggest-ever corruption scandals. An investigating judge in Baghdad has "issued arrest warrants for four senior officials of the former government", the government's anti-corruption agency said in a statement. The four men, who include a former finance minister and staff members of former prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, are all living outside the country, according to an official at the agency who spoke on condition of anonymity. The warrants do not name any of the officials, but according to the official, they are former finance minister Ali Allawi, the director of cabinet Raed Jouhi, personal secretary Ahmed Najati, and adviser Mushrik Abbas. Allawi, a respected politician and academic, resigned in August last year. When the scandal broke a few months later, he denied all responsibility. Al-Kadhemi defended his record on fighting corruption, saying his government had discovered the case, launched an investigation and taken legal action. The case, which has been dubbed "the heist of the century", sparked outrage in oil-rich Iraq, which critics say is plagued by corruption. At least $2.5 billion was stolen between September 2021 and August 2022 through 247 cheques that were cashed by five companies. The money was then withdrawn in cash from the accounts of these companies, most of whose owners are on the run. The four men are accused of "facilitating the embezzlement of sums belonging to the tax authorities," the statement said, adding that they would also be subject to an asset freeze. The country's current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has vowed to crack down on corruption since his appointment in late October.

Title: Prominent US lawyer sentenced to life for murdering his wife and son
Body: Alex Murdaugh, a prominent South Carolina lawyer, was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for the murders of his wife and son on their hunting estate in a case whose twists and turns drew global attention. Judge Clifton Newman sentenced Murdaugh, scion of an elite family of judges and attorneys, to consecutive life terms without parole for the June 7, 2021 murders of his son Paul and his wife Maggie. Dismissing Murdaugh's claims of innocence as "not credible," the judge told the disgraced attorney he must "see Paul and Maggie during the night times when you're attempting to go to sleep." "I'm sure they come and visit you," the judge said.   "All day and every night," replied the lanky red-haired Murdaugh, who was dressed in a tan prison jumpsuit and wearing handcuffs and ankle shackles. A jury in Walterboro, South Carolina, deliberated for less than three hours before finding Murdaugh guilty on Thursday after a six-week televised trial that gripped the nation. Netflix and HBO rushed out documentaries on the case before it was even over. Craig Moyer, a carpenter who served on the jury, told ABC News that Murdaugh came across as a "big liar" who did not show any "true remorse or any compassion." According to the prosecution, Murdaugh shot his wife and son after realizing his years of stealing millions of dollars from his law firm and from clients to feed his hidden opioid addiction was about to go public. The 54-year-old Murdaugh briefly addressed the court during the sentencing in a packed courtroom that included his surviving son, Buster, who testified in his defense. "I'm innocent. I would never hurt my wife Maggie. And I would never hurt my son Paw Paw," he said, using his son's nickname. "It might not have been you," the judge responded. "It might have been the monster you become when you take 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 opioid pills." Prosecutor Creighton Waters urged the judge to impose the maximum of life in prison on a man he called a "cunning manipulator." "The depravity, the callousness, the selfishness of these crimes, are stunning," Waters said. "He violated the trust of so many, including his friends, his family, his partners, his profession, and most of all, Maggie and Paul." During the sentencing, the judge noted that Murdaugh's family had "controlled justice in this community for over a century" and "many have received the death penalty -- probably for lesser conduct" than in this case. Murdaugh's 22-year-old son Paul was killed with a shotgun and his 52-year-old wife Maggie with an assault rifle the family used to hunt wild pigs on their sprawling property. While evidence put Murdaugh at the scene shortly before the murders, the guns were never found, and there was no bloodstained clothing or other direct evidence that could prove he was the killer. But the jury determined the evidence was strong enough to convict Murdaugh on two counts of murder and two firearms charges. Murdaugh testified in his own defence and described discovering the bodies of his wife and son at the dog kennels on their property known as Moselle. Murdaugh admitted he stole and embezzled, and also lied about his drug habit, which his attorneys said cost $50,000 a week. But he said he would never lie about killing his family. Murdaugh's attorneys argued that investigators had failed to pursue other possible suspects, including Murdaugh's drug suppliers and people angry over Paul's involvement in the February 2019 boating death of a teenage girl. Waters, the prosecutor, called Murdaugh "a master liar" who stole money from a crippled client, from the family of a former Murdaugh maid who died in a fall years earlier, and from his law partners. Waters focused on Murdaugh's lying to investigators on the evening of the crime that he had not been at the kennels before he discovered the bodies. A video found on Paul's cell phone showed Murdaugh was there an estimated five minutes before the shootings. "Everyone who thought they knew who he was, he's fooled them," said Waters. "He fooled Maggie and Paul too, and they paid with their lives." Correction March 4, 2022: A previous version misstated that Murdaugh killed his daughter, rather than son.

Title: Dutch prosecutors seek jail for footballer Promes over stabbing
Body: Dutch prosecutors demanded a two-year prison sentence for  former Netherlands international footballer Quincy Promes at the start of his trial Friday over the stabbing of a cousin. The 31-year-old Spartak Moscow forward is alleged to have attacked the victim at a family birthday party in Abacoude, near Amsterdam, in 2020 in what is thought to have been a row over a stolen necklace. Promes, who pleads not guilty, did not attend the opening of the trial in Amsterdam as he is in Russia fulfilling his contractual obligations to his club, his lawyer said.

Title: Daughter of murdered baron says 35-year wait for trial is 'shameful'
Body: The daughter of a man murdered 35 years ago has criticised the "shameful" delay in bringing the case to trial and said she is "appalled" to read reports dedicated to his alleged killer's claims of mistreatment. Chiara Sant Cassia said she and her brother were traumatised by the murder of their father, Baron Francis Sant Cassia, who was shot dead on the grounds of his home in Mġarr in October 1988. Earlier this week, his alleged killer Carmel Camilleri filed a judicial protest claiming that his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time has been violated through unreasonable delays.  In a statement on Friday, Sant Cassia asked if anyone had spared a thought for the family of the murder victim. “I am appalled by the recent reporting of my father’s murder," she said. "My father was shot dead at point-blank range in cold blood 35 years ago. Reading pages of newsprint dedicated to proving how badly the man accused of murdering my father has been treated seems wrong.” She said she and her brother have “suffered greatly” from the loss of their father and their own children were left unable to meet the “kind and true gentleman” that he was. “The way in which I lost my Dad was so terribly traumatic and the loss never leaves you, not even after 35 years," she said. “This atrocious murder of such a lovely, kind and true gentleman involves some powerful people who for some reason wanted my father dead and every person involved should and must be held accountable. “It is shameful that this trial has not come to court for so long with many questions left unanswered.” In 2006, Camilleri was charged with the murder of Sant Cassia and for carrying a firearm without a licence.  Following his arrest, interrogation and arraignment in 2006, a bill of indictment was issued in 2008.  Since then, Camilleri said he had faithfully abided by bail conditions and attended every court hearing after spending some two years in preventive custody.  He has remained on bail for the past 17 years. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: From zero, Malta now has highest rate of open EU fraud investigations per capita
Body: Malta went from having not a single actionable report of fraud related to EU funds to becoming the country with the most reports per capita in Europe in just a year, according to the EU’s anti-graft agency. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) annual report published yesterday revealed that Malta ended 2022 with 14 investigations at the EPPO’s office over projects worth a total of €123.5 million. Three of those cases concern VAT fraud investigations of projects worth a total of €70.5 million. Four cases include cross-border investigations, another four concern corruption, two are about procurement expenditure fraud and one concerns money laundering. Three cases of possible fraud emerged from agricultural and rural development programmes, one emerged from maritime and fisheries programmes and another one emerged from mobility and transport, energy and digitalisation programmes. The EPPO was established in 2017 to investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU’s financial interests, such as fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud. It mainly investigates fraud in member states over EU funds. Last October, Times of Malta revealed that the EPPO was investigating the €40 million Marsa flyover project for potential corruption. The massive infrastructure project, one of the biggest in recent years, was partly EU financed. Data seized by the police from Yorgen Fenech’s mobile phone had revealed Fenech’s background role as a middleman in the project, against the promise of €2 million in “success fees”, half of which were planned to be funnelled to a secret offshore company linked to 17 Black.  RELATED STORIES  But just a year before, in 2021, Malta was scolded for not reporting any cases. In October 2021, EPPO chief prosecutor Laura Kovesi said this meant possible abuse going unchecked. While her office had received 2,200 reports from around the EU that year, just two came from Malta and neither of them had led to investigations as they were not within her office’s remit.   By the end of that year, Malta had filed five reports, none of which led to investigations. The EPPO annual report published yesterday shows that last year, it received 18 reports or complaints, 14 from local authorities, two from EU bodies and institutions, one from a private party, while another is an ex officio investigation. PN MEP candidate Peter Agius also highlighted the stark fact yesterday, saying Malta by far exceeded the small and medium-sized member states in the number of reports and that ‘the €300 million Vitals fraud is the tip of the Labour iceberg’.

Title: State breached Zenith directors' rights with failure to extract phone data
Body: A judge has ruled that the state breached the rights of two directors accused of money laundering by failing to provide the tools needed to extract data from a locked phone. The evidence, needed by the prosecution, must now be produced by April 4 or the compilation of evidence against the directors will proceed without it, the constitutional court ruled in a case brought by two former Zenith Finance directors, Matthew Pace and Lorraine Falzon.   The state’s failure unnecessarily dragged out the money-laundering proceedings and resulted in a breach of Pace and Falzon’s rights, the court said. Zenith used to be worth €25 million but ran into debt after the two were charged with money laundering and a blanket freezing order was imposed on their assets. Pace and Falzon were among a line of high-profile figures, including former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri and Nexia BT financial advisors Brian Tonna and Karl Cini, who were arraigned in connection with financial crimes and corruption in March 2021. Both directors deny the charges. Pace’s password-locked mobile phone was seized when the police searched his home. Having not yet consulted his lawyers, he told investigators that he “was not in a position to provide the PIN number”, the court heard. That meant that when he and Falzon were arraigned, the police had no access to the phone data. Nine months into the compilation of evidence, the prosecution requested the extraction of the data, saying that it could contain chats relevant to the case. But at that stage, Pace was unable to recall the password since the device had been out of his possession for several months. “In one and half years, my life changed completely. One moment I employed 70, 80 people, the next nothing. One moment [I operated] a company worth €25 million, suddenly I’m in debt… I totally forgot [the password]… I honestly don’t know it,” Pace testified. A court-appointed expert was unable to unlock the device and was authorised to seek the assistance of a foreign firm.  RELATED STORIES  However, the service requested by the courts services agency also met an obstacle. The foreign company needed more time because of “enhanced due diligence” that was called for in view of the fact that there were “politically exposed persons” linked to the case. Meanwhile, progress in the criminal proceedings ground to a halt. As the prosecution insisted on the phone data, months dragged by. This finally prompted Zenith’s lawyers to seek redress before the constitutional courts, arguing that their clients’ fundamental right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time had been breached. The prosecution was “fishing” for data while the accused’s lives were “literally frozen”, defence lawyers argued. Delivering judgment in the First Hall, Civil Court, Madam Justice Joanne Vella Cuschieri observed that the inquiring magistrate had ordered extraction of the phone data nine days before the applicants were arraigned in 2021. Since August 2021, records of the court proceedings refer to that evidence and nothing else. After the breach-of-rights case was filed in July 2022, no luck was registered in obtaining the requested data. Were it not for that obstacle, the prosecution could have wrapped up its evidence stage “in one-sixth of the time it has taken so far”, said the judge, observing that the AG had insisted on having the electronic data for “20 months”. The compilation of evidence, which under normal circumstances should have taken a few months, was now edging close to the two-year term solely because of this obstacle, which was certainly no fault of the accused. The prosecution was in duty bound to produce the best evidence but also to do so within a reasonable time, the judge said. This was “a criterion which in this case is evidently not being observed”. The delay was so blatant, the court said, that it was not necessary to wait for criminal proceedings to be concluded to declare that the lapse of time experienced so far was unjustified. Such delay was attributable to a lack of resources needed to effect the requested extraction from Pace’s devices. Without entering into an analysis as to whether the data was necessary for the criminal case, the court declared that Pace and Falzon had suffered a breach of their right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time. At this stage, declaring such breach was “the most effective remedy which the court could give the applicants”, said Madam Justice Vella Cuschieri. No damages were to be calculated at this stage but once the decision became final it was to be notified to the speaker in parliament and also to the magistrate presiding over the compilation proceedings. The data was to be produced within six months from the date when the magistrate conducting criminal proceedings had appointed another expert to extract and analyse the phone data “as soon as possible”. That order was given on October 4, 2022. Upon the lapse of six months from that date – in just over a month’s time – the magistrate was to immediately put an end to the prosecution’s evidence, declared the judge.

Title: Jean Paul Sofia cannot be allowed to become a statistic, PN leader insists
Body: The opposition will continue to insist that a public inquiry should be held into the collapse of a Corradino building on December 3 which cost the life of Jean Paul Sofia, Bernard Grech said on Thursday.  Speaking outside the collapsed building, he said that three months since the tragic accident that took the 20-year-old's life, the government was still resisting the request.  "We will continue putting pressure for the government to do what is just and right," the Opposition leader said.  “Society needs to send a clear message that something as serious and tragic as this cannot be ignored.”   Sofia was the only fatality after the sudden collapse. Five workers were rescued from the rubble, three of them seriously injured.  Calls for a public inquiry from the opposition and Jean Paul’s mother, have been ignored.     Asked recently in parliament whether a public inquiry would be launched, prime minister Robert Abela skirted the question saying there was an ongoing magisterial inquiry and investigations by other authorities were also underway.   “If we really want justice, the work of these institutions should be allowed to be done in serenity,” Abela had told parliament.  Grech said he met Jean Paul's parents, Isabelle and John, on Wednesday and they expressed their disappointment at the state of affairs. They do not feel that they are getting replies to their pleas, he said.  "The whole truth needs to emerge and it is only through a public inquiry that this can happen, identifying shortcomings so that we can possibly avoid similar tragedies in the future," he said. Grech reiterated the opposition's plan to move a motion in parliament for an inquiry to be held. He had first announced the opposition's intention on February 21. The press conference was also addressed by PN MPs Jerome Caruana Cilia and Stanley Zammit.  Caruana Cilia said that despite calls for a public inquiry, the government remained hard-headed.  "We cannot allow Jean Paul to become a statistic.   Zammit spoke about "half baked amendments" to the criminal code presented in parliament recently and stressed that any licencing of contractors had to follow a rigorous process.

Title: Man still awaiting trial for murder that took place 35 years ago
Body: A man who is awaiting trial for a murder that took place almost 35 years ago is claiming that his fundamental rights are being breached through the Attorney General’s refusal to drop charges against him.  The claims were made in a judicial protest filed on Thursday by 68-year-old father-of-four Carmel Camilleri, through his lawyers. Camilleri was arrested and charged with wilful homicide back in 2006, 18 years after the fatal shooting of Baron Francis Sant Cassia at Mġarr. Seventeen years down the line, he is still awaiting trial by jury and is in no way responsible for the “senseless delay”, the protest says. Nor can the delay be attributed to the judges presiding over the criminal proceedings.   RELATED STORIES  Following Camilleri’s arrest, interrogation and arraignment in 2006, a bill of indictment was issued in 2008.  Since then, Camilleri said he had faithfully abided by bail conditions and attended every court hearing after spending some two years in preventive custody.  However, his physical and mental health has deteriorated so badly that nowadays he can no longer have a simple conversation with his close relatives.  In January, he was admitted to Mount Carmel Hospital following an application by his lawyers who could no longer communicate with him, let alone offer him legal advice.  Camilleri and his lawyers argue the situation has resulted in a breach of the fundamental rights, not only of Camilleri, but also of his family.  His right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time has been violated through the unreasonable delays, the lawyers argued. Moreover, both the accused and his family have faced endless suffering and had thus been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. Although the Attorney General knew there was not “a shred of evidence” against Camilleri, the State prosecutor has allowed the case to drag on senselessly for 17 years, refusing to issue a nolle prosequi (no further action) in his regard.  All this has landed the accused and his family in a “pitiable” state and this only a result of the abusive behaviour of the AG and the State Advocate, who were both targeted in the judicial protest.  Furthermore, the accused was also being discriminated against as a result of the AG’s absolute discretion, the lawyers said.  They observed that last year the AG applied a totally different yardstick when dealing with a case concerning a former director and high-ranking official of Pilatus Bank.  Although the magistrate conducting the inquiry into allegations of financial crimes at the now-shuttered bank had directed criminal action against two senior officials, namely Mehmet Tasli and Antoniella Gauci, the AG had issued a nolle prosequi in their regard.  And that decision was taken within six months of receiving the records of the inquiry, Camilleri’s lawyers pointed out, drawing a comparison to their client’s case which was handled in a very different manner.  In this case, after 17 years and with no admissible evidence against Camilleri who was in a poor state of health, the AG still did not drop charges. Such “abusive, irresponsible and discriminatory behaviour” breached the accused’s rights, concluded his lawyers, who stated that the AG and State Advocate were being held liable. The protesting parties also reserved the right to further legal action accordingly.  Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta signed the judicial protest.

Title: Repeat sexual offender denied bail after new case
Body: A repeat sexual offender was denied bail on Wednesday after pleading not guilty to indecently touching a 22-year old vulnerable youth whom he had been convicted of abusing as a minor. Anthony Pirotta, 66 of Qormi, landed back in the dock almost a year since he was placed under probation, making this the third time since he faced sexual offence charges in court. On Tuesday, the youth reported that he had been molested by Pirotta who had followed him on the street when he stepped off a bus, badgering him in public. At one point, Pirotta had allegedly touched the youth’s private parts and bottom. Deeply disturbed, the youth filed a police report, triggering investigations which resulted in Pirotta’s arrest. He was charged with allegedly committing non-consensual sexual acts upon the victim, subjecting him to acts of physical intimacy, causing him to suffer slight injuries as well as offending public morals or decency. He was also charged with breaching the probation order handed down in April 2022. Pirotta pleaded not guilty, claiming in court that the alleged victim had offended him and insulted his parents. His lawyers requested bail, but the prosecution strongly objected. Pirotta was a “serial sexual offender,” pointed out Inspector John Spiteri, explaining that this was the third time the accused was facing similar charges. Although he was placed under probation last year and also ordered to seek treatment, the accused had wasted the chances given to him by the courts and instead returned to old ways, molesting the same person he had been convicted of sexually abusing when the victim was still a minor. The incident had so upset the youth that he had to be driven to work by his mother for fear that he might again meet the accused on the way. In a separate case, the accused had been examined by a psychiatrist who certified him as having a “low IQ,” but nonetheless capable of understanding and willing his actions. Describing the accused as “a threat to society,” the inspector argued that it was still too premature for the court to grant bail. Defence lawyer Franco Debono rebutted that the alleged sexual acts consisted of touching, placing this offence at the lower end of the spectrum of sexual offences. Moreover, it needed to be pointed out that the accused too had mental issues. Unfortunately, Maltese law did not cater for such cases of “diminished responsibility” where imprisonment would not be suitable for persons facing criminal charges who, however, would still need some form of confinement. This “classic example” of diminished responsibility was currently a “blind spot” under our law, argued Debono, further requesting a ban on publication of the accused’s name and urging the court to be sensitive also towards the alleged offender’s plight. The prosecution also objected to the ban, arguing that publishing the accused’s name could possibly lead to other yet-unknown victims stepping forward. Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo turned down the request for bail in view of the serious nature of the charges, the fact that the alleged victim was still to testify and also taking note of the accused’s character. The court also turned down the request to ban the accused’s name, whilst ordering a ban on the name of the alleged victim. The court noted that the parties were not related in any way. AG lawyers Cynthia Tomasuolo and Kaylie Bonett prosecuted together with inspectors John Spiteri and James Mallia. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Title: Teen admits to grievously injuring boy during Valletta carnival brawl
Body: A 17-year-old boy involved in fight during Carnival celebrations in Valletta admitted to grievously injuring another boy and attacking two minors.  The teenager, whose name and personal details were banned by court, was escorted to court on Friday afternoon.  In the presence of his parents, he admitted to the charges stemming from the incident that happened on February 18 at around 10pm outside a Burger King outlet.  He was charged with grievous bodily harm, wilful damage to third party property after damaging the victim's spectacles, attacking two minors, insulting and threatening them as well as breach of public peace. Police were alerted to the fight among a group of youngsters. When they got there, they found two male youths who were injured but the aggressor had fled the scene.  CCTV footage and other evidence led to the identification of the suspect who was arrested on Friday morning and charged.  His lawyers requested a pre-sentencing report although there appeared to be no underlying problems.  Bail was not objected to in view of the early admission.  The accused's criminal conduct was untainted and the matter was a one-off incident, his lawyer Franco Debono argued.  The teen was granted bail against a personal guarantee of €1,000 and warned not to approach the prosecution witnesses.  The court presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, issued a protection order in favour of the two minors injured in the incident.  Inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Kevin Pulis prosecuted. Lawyer Marion Camilleri was also defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Recruiter offering jobs in Malta arrested in the Philippines
Body: A recruiter offering job placements in Malta was arrested by Filipino authorities this week following an investigation by the country’s Department of Migrant Workers (DMW).   Jonnalyn M Sebastian, one of four members of an alleged illegal recruitment ring was arrested at a residential address in Paete, Laguna in an operation that resulted in the "rescue" of 33 overseas job applicants.    RELATED STORIES  Sebastian is alleged to have falsely represented herself as a coordinator from a licensed recruitment agency operating government-to-government placements for workers.  Applicants report being asked to pay between €1,700 and €6,000 for acceptance onto the scheme, with initial “placement fees” of between €1,700 and €2,500 charged to cover training, medical examinations and other costs.   Candidates who could not afford the high costs were advised to apply for loans, which would be repaid out of future salary payments.   Those who had applied became suspicious after not being deployed to Malta or Malaysia — the other target destination in the scheme — when a considerable amount of time had passed, with three subsequently alerting authorities to Sebastian’s activities.  It is not yet clear whether any of the applicants made it to Malta.   The arrests follow a surveillance operation by the DMW’s Anti-Illegal Recruitment Branch (AIRB), supported by the Laguna provincial police and the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP).  "Sebastian, given the sheer number of complainants, faces a non-bailable offence and possibly, a lifetime of jail time," Secretary of the DMW Susan Ople said following the arrest.  She faces charges of large-scale illegal recruitment activities, “tantamount to economic sabotage which is a non-bailable offence”, according to a public statement issued by the DMW on Thursday.   The department is assisting the victims of the operation in advance of court proceedings against Sebastian, her husband and two accomplices.

Body: A small crowd called for justice for murder victim Sion Grech on Thursday in a vigil held outside the law courts in Valletta. It was held a month after the two men accused of her murder were acquitted after a trial by jury.  Grech was found dead in a Marsa field in April 2005 eight days after being reported missing. She had been stabbed at least 17 times, an autopsy revealed.  Eight years later, in 2013, Ismael Habesh and Faical Mohouachi were charged with her murder, though it took another decade for the trial to start.     On January 20, both men were found innocent following a trial that was criticised by Grech’s family and the Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement (MGRM) for its lengthy delay, evidence not being properly preserved and statements to police by one of the accused being ruled inadmissible.   The vigil was attended by about 40, mostly young and middle-aged people, some of whom carried candles. They also carried placards with a picture of Sion and a call for "Justice for Sion." A few people were seen shedding tears as speeches were read by friends and relatives of Sion, demanding justice and hitting out at the authorities for what was seen as negligence and 'institutionalised homophobia' in the way the investigation and the trial were handled and also in other stages of Sion's life.    Sion's niece, Adiel Grech,  expressed appreciation for the vigil: "I'm lost for words. It was something we were not expecting. But to be here tonight and with all these people representing LGBTIQ, the MGRM and us as a family... Trying to keep the memory of our beloved alive and see justice. It's one step at a time." One of those present said she had gone to the event because it gave space for the trans community to grieve. She said she felt bombarded by news stories about violence against trans people. Lawyer and activist Lara Dimitrijevic said Sion was not only failed but also betrayed. "What happened to her case was a slap in the face to her family, to every victim waiting for justice and to every woman in this country. It was nothing short of a slap in the face of justice" she said Also present were members of the Malta Gay Rights Movement,  Graffitti Movement, Young Progressive Beings and the Women's Rights Foundation.

Title: Man handed suspended sentence after stealing credit card, goes on shopping spree
Body: A man who stole a credit card and went on a shopping spree for foodstuffs has been handed a suspended sentence after admitting to theft and fraud.  The owner of the bank card reported that it had gone missing on January 21 sometime between 4pm and 7.30pm.  He later received a message indicating that his card had been used in a transaction at a convenience store at Żejtun.  Soon after, another message flagged a second transaction.  Investigators obtained footage from the commercial outlets where the card had been used and singled out the suspect who had gone shopping with his partner.  Nadim Mharam Abdul Gader Mharam, 40, was identified as the man who regularly signed a bail book in relation to a separate case.  The suspect was arrested and his statements were released earlier on Thursday.  Upon arraignment, he was charged with aggravated theft of the BOV card and fraud to the detriment of the bank and the shop owners.  The first purchases were made at around 8.30pm at the Żejtun store, followed by a visit to a Żejtun bakery an hour later.  Later that evening, he again used the card at another food outlet at Żabbar.  The prosecution said that the amounts involved were between €50 and €70 at each shop.  The accused was also charged with leading a vagrant and idle life, relapsing and breaching previous bail conditions.  The man registered an admission which he confirmed after being granted time to consult his lawyer and reconsider his plea.  In light of that admission, the court, presided over by Magistrate Ian Farrugia, condemned the man to a two-year jail term suspended for four years and a fine of €500.  Inspectors Jonathan Cassar and Doriette Cuschieri prosecuted.  Lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar was defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Man admits to hitting partner at home, handed suspended sentence
Body: A student who admitted to hitting his partner during a heated argument inside the couple's Sliema apartment on Wednesday was handed a suspended sentence upon his arraignment on Thursday.  Gustavo Adolfo Rojas Vivas, a 21-year-old Colombian national, was arrested by rapid intervention officers who rushed to the scene after neighbours called about the commotion that was taking place inside the apartment at Main Street, Sliema.  There was shouting as the couple argued inside.  When the police knocked, the accused’s girlfriend appeared with a deep gash on her forehead.  Trying to communicate through a language barrier, the woman explained that her boyfriend had hit her, causing her that injury.  The youth was arrested and escorted to court on Thursday, registering an admission and telling the court that he was sorry. The prosecution declared that investigations and evidence related to the incident showed that the case was one of grievous bodily harm punishable with a term of imprisonment between one year and seven years, rather than the more serious case liable to a jail term between five and 10 years. Assisted by an interpreter, the accused pleaded guilty to grievously injuring his girlfriend and disturbing the repose of residents.  He confirmed his plea after being given time to reconsider.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Ian Farrugia, condemned the accused to a two-year jail term suspended for four years.  The court also issued a restraining order in favour of the victim.  Inspector Omar Zammit prosecuted. Lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar was defence counsel.  Sources told Times of Malta that immigration authorities will now step in.

Title: Weinstein to be sentenced in Hollywood rape case
Body: Disgraced movie industry tycoon Harvey Weinstein is due to be sentenced Thursday over the rape of a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel room a decade ago. The Academy Award-winning producer, 70, is already serving a 23-year sentence for his separate 2020 conviction in New York for sex crimes. He could face a further 18-year term in California, which would increase the likelihood that the "Shakespeare in Love" mogul will see out the remainder of his life in prison - though he is appealing in both cases. In December, he was convicted by a Los Angeles jury of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by a foreign object of a European actress whose identity was not revealed. The court heard explicit accounts of meetings between the previously influential movie producer and several young women who were attempting to find a foothold in Hollywood. Prosecutors said Weinstein exploited and abused women for years, and long enjoyed impunity because of his then-powerful position in the industry. The women would have risked losing their future Hollywood job prospects if they had publicly accused Weinstein at the time, prosecutors said.  RELATED STORIES  Weinstein was ultimately convicted in the Los Angeles case of assaulting one woman but acquitted of sexual battery involving a second. The jury did not reach a verdict on charges relating to the alleged assaults of two other women, one of whom was identified by her lawyers as Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the now-wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom. Thursday's court session will begin with a hearing on a defence motion requesting either a new trial or a reduced verdict. Defence court filings seen by AFP allege that Weinstein's lawyers were precluded from admitting important evidence about the rape victim - including Facebook messages with an alleged lover which the judge deemed irrelevant - and that their cross-examination was limited. If the motion is denied, Judge Lisa Lench has said that sentencing will take place that same day. Weinstein is appealing the Los Angeles verdict. In New York last June, Weinstein lost his first appeal against his criminal verdict and sentence in the state's intermediate appellate court. But he has also further appealed that case to the higher New York Court of Appeals.  Weinstein's behaviour had been the topic of rumours in entertainment circles for years, but his powerful status in Hollywood ensured few were willing to publicly call him out. But bombshell allegations broke against him in 2017, launching the #MeToo movement and paving the way for hundreds of women to fight back against sexual violence in the workplace. Dozens of women have now accused Weinstein of predatory behaviour. After his conviction in New York, a civil trial awarded $17 million to dozens of other women who had accused the former movie magnate of abuse. Earlier this month, the European actress who Weinstein was convicted of rape in Los Angeles also sued him for damages. The civil case alleges sexual battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. "The conduct of Defendant Weinstein was despicable, and done with malice, oppression and fraud, thus justifying an award of punitive damages against him," her lawsuit says.

Title: Gunman returns to Florida murder scene, kills reporter and child
Body: A man suspected of killing a woman on Wednesday in Florida returned to the scene of the crime hours later and gunned down a television reporter and a nine-year-old girl, authorities said. Orange County Sheriff John Mina said that a 19-year-old man, Keith Melvin Moses, had been taken into custody and was believed responsible for the shootings. The attacks occurred in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando in central Florida. A 20-year-old woman was slain there at around 11am, the sheriff's department said Wednesday.  A team from Spectrum News 13 arrived hours later to cover the murder, Mina said at an evening news conference.  Shortly after 4pm time, Moses arrived and opened fire on a Spectrum camera operator and a reporter as they stood near their vehicle, killing the reporter and wounding the camera operator, the sheriff added. The gunman then entered a nearby home and shot a woman and her nine-year-old daughter. The victims were all taken to the hospital, but the girl and the Spectrum News 13 reporter died, Mina said. "We have detained the person believed to be responsible for the murder this morning, as well as the shootings this afternoon," Mina said. He added that the suspect had a "lengthy criminal history" that included "gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges." The detainee, who knew the woman killed in the morning, had no ties to the other victims, the sheriff said.  None of those shot were immediately identified. "No one in our community, not a mother, not a nine-year-old child, and certainly not news professionals should become victims of gun violence," Mina said.

Title: Victim of assault spots alleged assailant in shop, and gets assaulted again
Body: A man was robbed of his mobile and some €700 in cash as he was taking photos of two men inside a Marsa store after recognizing one of them as the aggressor who had attacked him a while before, a court heard on Wednesday. The incident landed Justin Mallia, 24 of Santa Lucija - one of the two men in the store - back in court, months after he had been granted bail in separate proceedings. The case started on Monday evening when a Somali man reported that he had been having a drink at a Marsa bar when a stranger drove up in a car, stepped out and assaulted him. Following that allegedly unprovoked attack, the stranger drove off. Later that evening at around 9:pm, the victim was walking along Triq is-Serkin when he spotted two men inside a store. One of them - not the accused- appeared to be the same man who had attacked him earlier. He decided to photograph the men and then file a police report. Police Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa said CCTV footage showed the alleged victim holding up his mobile phone to snap pictures of the two. The accused signalled his mate and then ran after the victim, attacking him and snatching the mobile phone, together with some €700 in cash which were tucked away inside the man’s pocket. “The victim did take photos, that’s true. But it wasn’t the victim who provoked the attack,” said the prosecutor. Mallia was charged with aggravated theft, holding the victim against his will and slightly injuring him. He was also charged with breaching two previous bail decrees and relapsing. He pleaded not guilty. Bail was objected to by the prosecution, mainly because the victim still has to testify. Moreover, the accused had last regularly signed the bail book towards the end of last year and had only turned up to sign some three or four times this year, added Inspector Zerafa. When police called at his address some time after the incident, Mallia was not there. That meant that he was not at home outside curfew hours. The accused had later told police that he had gone to sleep at a friend’s place after quarrelling with his partner that day. Defence lawyer Franco Debono promptly rebutted that the couple had patched things up, pointing out that the accused’s partner was present in court. Asked by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, the woman confirmed that if granted bail, the accused would live with her.  After hearing submissions the court declared that a decision on bail would be decreed on in chambers. Lawyer Francesca Zarb was also defence counsel.

Title: Man accused of importing €150,000 worth of heroin remanded in custody
Body: A 45-year-old Pole, Marcin Bieszczad, 45, was remanded in custody on Tuesday after pleading not guilty to importing four kilos of heroin having a street value of €150,000. The police reported on Monday how the drug was found in a hidden compartment of his suitcase during a search at the airport. Bieszczad was also accused of supplying or distributing the drug and possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not intended for his personal use. The search was carried out soon after the accused flew in from Frankfurt when police and customs officers noticed him acting suspiciously.  Defence lawyer Sue Mercieca, did not request bail at this stage. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, remanded the accused in custody and issued a freezing order over all his assets as requested by the prosecution. Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.

Title: Six alleged burglars targeted Mrieħel warehouse three times
Body: Six men were taken to court on Tuesday, accused of involvement in theft from an Mrieħel warehouse that was targeted three times.   The case dates back to October 15 last year when cigarettes and other items were stolen during the night from the Charles Grech warehouse at Mrieħel.  The same warehouse was also targeted in January but an apparent theft was foiled when an alarm went off.   Four days later, the same warehouses were targeted again and more cigarettes and other items were stolen. Police investigators working on CCTV footage and other evidence identified one of the suspects, Carlos Pace, of Marsa.  Eventually they arrived at identifying three other suspects. Later, police found stolen merchandise inside the car and shop of another suspect, Joe Mark Mercieca, 29 of Zabbar, who told the court that he is an environmental officer at ERA. Police eventually rounded up the six suspects, variously involved in the case.  During the arraignment, Carlos Pace, 21, from Marsa and Daniel Vella, 21, Zejtun, both pleaded guilty to theft. They were granted bail pending judgement, under a €5000 personal guarantee, They were ordered to sign the bail book once weekly. Mercieca was charged with handling stolen goods and defrauding government of due taxes. The other accused were James Azzopardi,  33, Hamrun,  Leon Calleja, 21, of Birkirkara, and Jonathan Degiorgio, 37, of Sta Venera. Azzopardi was also accused of theft of number plates, driving a Ford Transit without a licence and insurance cover as well as breaching four previous bail decrees. Degiorgio was also accused of breaching previous bail conditions. All pleaded not guilty. Degiorgio's lawyer, Franco Debono, requested bail. He pointed out that various factors militated in favour of bail. The accused had cooperated, played the least role, made a great change in life, and had got a job. The prosecution admitted that this suspect played the least role, telling police about his involvement in preparations for the theft without taking part in the actual robbery in January, He had however allegedly breached various previous bail decrees. Degiorgio had stepped out of jail after Christmas and was lucky enough to find a regular job. He previously had a drug problem which he seemed to be addressing. He had been making progress but then unfortunately landed in fresh trouble, explained Inspector Joseph Mercieca. "The problem lies in the company he keeps"  Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit denied bail in view of the various charges, and alleged breach of previous bail decrees. The court directed a probation officer to follow the accused and report back to court under a temporary supervision order. Mercieca also requested bail, his lawyer pointing out that his case was different. He was not charged with theft but with handling stolen goods and breaching tax laws Bail was granted under various conditions, including prohibition to approach prosecution witnesses, signing bail book twice a week, a €500 deposit and a €5,000 guarantee. No request for bail was made at this stage in respect of James Azzopardi. Finally, Leon Calleja requested bail. His lawyer, Alessandro Lia, pointed out that charges in respect of his client were almost identical to those against the two who had registered an admission. The only difference was that he was charged with relapsing because of driving without a licence years ago. Finally, Leon Calleja requested bail.  Bail was granted under supervision by a probation officer, warning not to approach police witnesses, signing bail book three times weekly, curfew between midnight to 7:00 am, deposit €500 and a personal guarantee of €5000. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb assisted Pace, Vella and Degiorgio.  Lawyers Michael Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri assisted Mercieca and Azzopardi. Lawyer Alessandro Lia assisted Calleja. Inspectors Joseph Mercieca, Christina Delia and Ritienne Gauci prosecuted. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Tree planted in memory of Pelin Kaya uprooted by vandals
Body: A tree planted in memory of murder victim Pelin Kaya has been uprooted in an apparently random act of vandalism.  The oak tree was planted in Ta' Xbiex public gardens two weeks ago as a mark of respect for the Turkish woman. However, Friends of Villa Frere, an NGO that focuses on saving the historic estate in Pietà, revealed on Tuesday that it had been ripped out of the ground.  “I guess we were too hopeful... a few weeks isn't so bad by Malta's standards maybe...” the group wrote on Facebook.    “We planted it as a kind gesture and respect to her since she passed away so tragically,” a spokesperson for the NGO said. Although the oak tree was in her name, there were no plaques signifying the site, suggesting that it may have been a random act of vandalism.  The plant will soon be re-planted in Villa Frere’s own grounds “under our care and vigil,” they said. When the organisation originally planted the tree, they chose an oak because it is the national tree of Turkey and said they hoped it would flourish through the years.   Pelin, an interior designer, was walking in front of Paul & Rocco petrol station in Gżira at 1am on January 18 when she was struck and killed by a black BMW, driven by Jeremie Camilleri. He has since been charged with the murder of the woman, who died an hour into her 30th birthday. Friends said that she had been walking home from a little birthday celebration at the time. This is not the first murder-victim vandalism of the month as Paulina Dembska’s temporary memorial was scratched on February 1. Paulina Dembska, 29, was killed in Independence Gardens, Sliema, on January 2 last year. Abner Aquilina, 21, is pleading not guilty to the crime.

Title: Police inspect commercial vehicles in Luqa
Body: The police last week joined other EU countries and the European Roads Policing Network coordinating traffic inspections on trucks and commercial vehicles in Triq Garibaldi, Luqa.  The inspections were organised by the European Labour Authority (ELA) as part of a European campaign for more safety on the road and also involved Transport Malta, Jobsplus and the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER). The police work in Malta was observed by the ELA and officers from Italy’s Polizia Stradale and the Croatian Transport Authority.   A total of 115 cars were stopped and 63 contraventions were issued, including for driving without a valid licence or insurance, missing number plates, problematic lighting and vehicles kept in a bad state. Two vehicles were confiscated and towed away by Transport Malta. Another 15 cases of breach of legislation were noted by the officers from DIER, including passengers working irregularly, without a work contract, or underpaid. Jobsplus officials found nine cases of breach of law, including foreigners working irregularly. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Malta’s wild west problem - David Casa
Body: Malta has a crime problem, fuelled in equal measure by a culture of impunity to take serious crime seriously and a problem of incompetence that lets criminals rest easy. Pelin Kaya’s body had just been laid to rest, leaving Malta’s infamously slow wheels of justice to grind on. A day later, Robert Brincau, the prison director at Corradino, was found guilty of threatening a man with a service weapon and slightly injuring him. Calls for his resignation ensued. And rightfully so. The home affairs minister had stuck his neck out for him, allowing a later-to-be convicted criminal to run the prison for another five months. The official ministry spokesperson said that Brincau’s case “wasn’t related to his work”. We’re supposed to believe that that’s fine. The same ministry responsible for law enforcement was happy to keep someone responsible for reforming inmates in charge despite charges of a violent crime. The message was clear, and it is symptomatic of just how seriously crime is taken by the PL government. If Labour is happy to keep criminals in powerful government jobs, then the entire enforcement machinery is cast into serious doubt. In the civil service, anyone subject to criminal accusations is at the very least suspended. Not so for the prison director. Despite himself being subject to criminal prosecution, he was kept there by Byron Camilleri’s ministry, in charge of criminal rehabilitation. This attitude feeds an insidious problem that is silently but steadily getting worse: impunity. The same impunity kept Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi in power despite a closet full of skeletons and a sky blackened by albatrosses. The same impunity enabled Silvio Valletta to undermine investigations into Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination. The same impunity let Labour ministers break electoral laws and use taxpayer money for unbridled self-promotion. The same impunity let MPs feel comfortable with taking bags of cash from those implicated in serious corruption. It is the same impunity that empowered Yorgen Fenech to think he could get away with murder. The same impunity let Joseph Muscat’s buddies travel freely in and out of Malta despite active European Arrest Warrants.  The same impunity made rogue soldiers think it was alright to kill Lassana Cisse.   Impunity pours gasoline onto the fire that is the justice system in Malta. Our police force is already underequipped and overstretched. It is responsible for securing the safety of a population that has exploded in two decades, driven by a tenfold increase in the foreign population. Population growth need not cause crime. Crime knows no nationality. The economic model chosen by the PL government is built upon a large imported workforce. But as Malta’s population reaches unprecedented figures, people want to know how it will cope under pressure. It isn’t that the number of police officers has not risen proportionality to Malta’s population. Not only has it remained low, but police numbers have actually declined. This despite efforts to relax entry requirements to the police force down to the lowest standards ever. Meanwhile, corruption in government puts unwarranted pressure on the police, restricting them from getting on with their job. Impunity is not a passive exercise, as the public inquiry evidenced. When a politically unconnected small fry is finally prosecuted, the cameras are invited in to make a spectacle as proof that the institutions are working. The spectacle returns when those institutions prove themselves incompetent with one botched prosecution after another. It is no wonder that the Maltese are increasingly concerned for their safety. Malta does feel more unsafe, an admission the prime minister made himself. Yet residents who have spent months calling for stronger police presence remain ignored. Residents and the police need more than a multimillion-euro investment in more new uniforms. First and foremost, they need incorruptible leadership with an inkling of a moral compass. Between extreme court delays, poor enforcement and bungled prosecutions, less than half of the Maltese trust the justice system. All this happening against a backdrop of political corruption, the perception of which is higher now than it was in the Muscat era. Residents deserve better, the police deserve better, Malta deserves better. David casa is a Nationalist Party MEP. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Police chief, AG face personal claim for damages in financial crime case
Body: The police commissioner and attorney general are facing a claim for damages by two directors of a financial firm who have been charged with money laundering and other financial crimes in cases connected to Keith Schembri and Nexia BT. The two former Zenith Finance directors claim to have been “maliciously prosecuted” and are pinning responsibility for damages upon Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà, as well as two former senior financial crimes investigators. Financial advisers Matthew Pace and Lorraine Falzon, of Zenith Finance Ltd and Zenith (Tied Insurance Intermediary) Ltd, are holding the four responsible both in their official and personal capacities. Pace and Falzon had been targeted by criminal investigations as a result of a magisterial inquiry requested by former opposition leader Simon Busuttil. Busuttil had submitted findings by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit into alleged money transfers to Adrian Hillman, former managing director of Progress Press, and to Schembri, former chief of staff at the OPM, through Schembri’s financial advisers Nexia BT. A separate magisterial inquiry had investigated claims of alleged kickbacks from the sale of passports involving Schembri and Nexia BT. Between March and May 2021, Pace and Falzon were among a number of figures, including Schembri and Hillman, who were arraigned under arrest and remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to money laundering and other financial crimes. The two directors were also charged in their personal and official capacity for accountancy law breaches and criminal conspiracy. They were granted bail a few days later. The criminal proceedings are still ongoing. Last year, an inspector from the Anti-Money Laundering Squad testified that Pace and Falzon had been charged in their personal capacity in spite of the prosecution knowing “from day one” that they had made no personal illicit gains. Inspector Ian Camilleri also said that the decision to press charges and insist on a freezing order upon all assets of the accused and their company had been taken by “a nucleus of persons” following collaboration between the office of the attorney general and the police. Faced with that testimony, defence lawyers warned that “someone must eventually shoulder personal responsibility” for that decision, which spelt serious repercussions for their clients because their business had been ruined. The warning was followed up last week when Zenith’s directors took their grievances to court. They filed judicial letters against Gafà and Buttigieg both in their official and personal capacity. Two other letters were filed, also before the First Hall, Civil Court, against former deputy police commissioner and financial crimes chief Alexandra Mamo and former financial crimes investigator superintendent Frank Anthony Tabone. Both senior officers have since resigned from the corps and are now legal professionals in private practice. All four are being held personally responsible for advising criminal action against the directors and their companies in March 2021. That advice, Pace and Falzon claim, was the result of “gross negligence,” non-observance of the principles of natural justice and consequently, in breach of their fundamental rights. Gafà, Buttigieg and the two former senior police officials had taken various actions which amounted to “malicious prosecution”. Therefore, they were to answer not only in their official capacity but also personally for the serious damages suffered by the directors and their companies. Pace and Falzon called on them to answer for their actions and to settle damages within a month. They reserved the right to take further legal action in terms of law. Running parallel to the criminal action before the Magistrates’ Court, Pace and Falzon are also engaged in a constitutional battle revolving around the issue of double jeopardy. The two had filed a case before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction challenging the criminal action which, they claim, ought to be dropped. Their lawyers argue that the facts underpinning the money laundering charges were identical to those on the basis of which Zenith Finance had paid a hefty administrative fine in 2018. That fine was confirmed by a representative from the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit who testified that MFSP Financial Management Ltd ‒ as Zenith Finance was formerly known ‒ had settled the €38,750 fine for administrative shortcomings flagged by analysts during investigations into the company’s operations. Criminal charges three years after payment of that fine stemmed from identical facts and the action, therefore, ran counter to the principle of double jeopardy and breached the former directors’ fundamental rights. Last November, Pace and Falzon were barred from taking any positions in the financial sector until criminal proceedings against them are concluded.

Title: Police return stolen Dali drawings to Barcelona owners
Body: Two 100-year-old charcoal drawings by surrealist master Salvador Dali that were stolen from a Barcelona home last year have been found and returned to their owners, Spanish police said Friday. The artworks, which have a value of around 300,000 euros ($320,000), were stolen from an upmarket neighbourhood of Barcelona in January 2022, Catalan regional police said. Police recovered the two drawings and arrested three brothers in their 50s who were involved in "highly-specialised" burglaries.  The drawings -- one of Catalan peasants, the other of traditional dances -- were then sent to the Gala-Salvador Dali Foundation to be authenticated.  Experts concluded they were drawn by the Catalan artist in 1922 when he was 18 to illustrate a book about the local area called "Les Gracies de l'Emporda" ('The Charms of Emporda').  The three arrested brothers had been operating in wealthy Barcelona areas, choosing their targets after days of surveillance, then breaking in when the owners were away, usually at weekends.  Once inside, they were selective, taking only valuable works of art as well as coin collections and other antiques. The trio were arrested in May 2022 along with two accomplices, with police also seizing five prints by the Catalan artist Joan Miro which have yet to be analysed by experts.  They also found 55 watches along with coins and antiques.                  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Daphne hitman Vince Muscat gets seven-month sentence for biting prisoner
Body: Vince Muscat, who is currently in prison for the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, has had a further seven months added to his sentence for biting another inmate. The hitman, also known as il-Koħħu, was caught on CCTV footage fighting with Keith Desmond Falzon, who is in prison for drugs and child pornography offences.  Details of the footage, as well as the testimony of a prison doctor, who saw teeth marks on Falzon's bicep, were presented as evidence at an earlier hearing connected to the incident on November 16, 2021. The Corradino Correctional Facility doctor described the injury as an abrasion and classified it as slight.  Muscat became the first person to be convicted of the murder of journalist Caruana Galizia when he pleaded guilty to planting and detonating the October 2017 car bomb. Neither Muscat nor Falzon agreed to testify about what happened when the fight broke out between them at the Corradino Correctional Facility. Warders had to intervene to break the men apart. Footage showed Muscat giving Falzon a shove before both parties ended up on the floor. Falzon's lawyer, Simon Micallef Stafrace argued that insults and threats leading up to the argument were not caught on camera.  The best evidence would have been for both parties to testify and explain to the court what happened, argued Muscat’s lawyer, Francesca Zarb.  At the Paola district hearing, Magistrate Nadine Lia found Muscat guilty and sentenced him to an additional seven months in prison. He is serving a 15-year sentence for his role in the Caruana Galizia murder after reaching a plea deal.  His lawyer gave notice of appeal.  Judgment is also expected in respect of Falzon.  Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Antonello Magri prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Man out on bail leads police on wild car chase ending in 3 kilo drug haul
Body: A man who was allegedly found in possession of three kilos of cannabis after leading police on a high-speed car chase while out on bail, was remanded in custody upon arraignment early on Monday. Kane Grima, 27, of Valletta, landed in fresh trouble after refusing to stop when the police signalled him to at Tal-Barrani Road, Żejtun, on Saturday. Instead, he led the police on a movie-like car chase all the way to Madliena. On the way, he crashed into police cars and third-party vehicles. Once he was blocked and stopped in Madliena, Grima was arrested and officers searched his car. The search continued at police headquarters in Floriana where officers discovered around three kilos of cannabis. On Monday morning, Grima was escorted to court and charged with possession of the drug in circumstances denoting that it was not intended solely for personal use. He was also accused of causing wilful damage to third-party property exceeding €2,500; driving in a careless, dangerous and reckless manner, refusing to obey legitimate police orders as well as unlawful possession of an unlicensed weapon. Grima was further charged with relapsing, breaching a probation order, a suspended sentence as well as two previous bail decrees handed down in 2018 and 2019. In light of such circumstances, his lawyers did not request bail at the arraignment stage. Magistrate Nadine Lia, thus remanded the accused in custody. Inspectors Mark A. Mercieca and John Leigh Howard prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Bernice Cassar murder: No plans to change domestic violence risk assessment
Body: There are no plans to replace the tool used to determine the risk factor of domestic violence victims once they file a police report, despite recent criticism, according to a social welfare spokesperson. A court last week heard how femicide victim Bernice Cassar – whose husband is charged with her murder – underwent a risk assessment after she filed a police report last May 8, alleging that her husband placed a knife against her neck. Her level of risk was judged by social workers to be medium. Six months later she was shot dead on her way to work. The spokesperson, as well as voluntary organisations that work with victims of domestic violence, stressed that focus has to be placed on the way the tool is used and results are interpreted rather than on the tool itself.  The tool, known as the DASH system – Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification – has faced criticism ever since it was introduced in Malta in 2018 when the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Act was enacted. More recently, a report that looked into domestic violence in Malta recommended looking into adopting “other risk assessment tools besides the currently used DASH (2009) to provide a more objective evaluation and prediction of risk”. Initially, magistrates, prosecutors, defence lawyers and the police complained that many cases are being ranked as “high risk”, overloading the system. Professionals flagged the fact that the tool could be easily abused by people wishing to “blow up” their report. But, on the other side of the spectrum, victims at high risk who were under stress when going through the assessment could get a lower score since results depended on their replies at the time. The report, ‘Perpetrators of Domestic Violence: Statistics and Perceptions of Risk Factors for Harmful Behaviour’, was carried out by the Faculty for Social Well-being after being commissioned by the tourism ministry and supported by the office of the wife of the prime minister. A spokesperson for the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS) explained that DASH is a voluntary tool that domestic violence victims are offered and the police should not to rely solely on the results since these depend on the data offered by the victim, which may not be complete for various reasons. “The use of DASH is fully in line with the Istanbul Convention of the Council of Europe. The convention emphasises that states shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure an assessment of the risk, the seriousness of the situation and the risk of repeated violence is carried out by all relevant authorities. “In this scenario, the DASH 2009 is the risk assessment tool that Malta has adopted,” the foundation spokesperson explained. The DASH risk assessment is done by risk assessors who are trained in using the tool. The checklist compiles details of the alleged abuse experienced by the victim through 27 questions, with focus being given to the reporting incident as well as past incidents, the foundation said. The score is based on the total number of ‘yes’ ticks following the disclosures made by the alleged victim. One to nine ‘yes’ ticks result in a standard risk, while 10 to 13 results in medium risk and 14 ticks or more indicate a high risk. The assessment then identifies the risk factors experienced by the alleged victim and the risk assessors’ professional judgement is noted, the spokesperson said. The DASH is a victim-focused tool used to identify the risk of harm. It is not an investigative tool and should not be used as the basis of a criminal investigation but it complements such investigation. The results of the risk assessment should not be quoted in isolation but should be accompanied by the outcome of criminal investigations. “The risk factors included in DASH are evidence-based and drawn from extensive research and analysis by leading academics in the field. “Risk assessors are trained in using DASH as this is crucial to understanding what the risk factors are and how they apply in each situation and what needs to be done to keep the victim safe. Needless to say, such a tool is obviously used only when the risk assessors are notified of an incident,” the spokesperson said.  The risk identification and assessment tool reflects the disclosures made by the alleged victim and a ‘standard’ or ‘medium’ risk score will not reflect any abusive incidents the victim failed to mention or minimised in their account.   “Risk identification and assessment is not a predictive process and there is no existing accurate procedure to calculate or foresee which cases may possibly in the future result in homicide or further assault and harm,” the spokesperson said. “In the case of Ms Bernice Cassar, a risk assessment was carried out on the 8th of May 2022, which resulted in medium risk. “This was the only instance when FSWS were asked to carry out a DASH assessment. Despite this result, the FSWS risk assessors offered Mrs Cassar temporary accommodation in a domestic violence shelter, which she, however, refused.”   As Chapter 589 of the Laws of Malta outlines, once an alleged victim of domestic violence or gender-based violence files a report with the gender-based violence and domestic violence police unit, the police offer the alleged victim the possibility of having the DASH risk assessment done by the domestic violence risk assessment service of Aġenzija Appoġġ. An alleged victim may choose to opt out of doing the risk assessment and, in that case, a waiver is signed. The domestic violence risk assessment service responds to all requests made by the police and its assessors go to the police headquarters, in Floriana, to carry out risk assessment. The original copy of the filled DASH risk assessment tool is passed on to the police to submit alongside the pressed charges, the spokesperson said. Criminologist Corinne Cutajar carried out a report titled  ‘Deadly affairs: How does domestic femicide occur in Malta?’ In this dissertation, she analysed the risk assessment system in place within the context of preventing femicide locally. Her study among criminal justice professionals found that Maltese lawyers believe the tool is not being used in the correct way and “some are abusing it by reporting things that are untrue”. In practice, the ‘yes/no’ statements should lead to an objective measure of risk posed to domestic violence victims, however, the additional aspects of the assessment requiring the risk assessor’s professional judgement are more subjective. Police officers interviewed by Cutajar also raised doubts on the way the assessments are being conducted as risk assessors may not be trained to ‘detect lies’. Cutajar concluded that conducting specific assessments on the perpetrator of domestic violence would further help curb the chance of femicide. In a recent interview with Times of Malta, police superintendent Johann Fenech, who heads the vice squad, said the tool alone did not provide an accurate assessment. The police do not rely on the score but carry out their own background checks and investigations to determine how urgently to treat a case. “There were times when the DASH score was low but the risk was high and vice versa,” he said.   Voluntary organisations that work with victims of domestic violence agreed that the problem lay with the way the tool was used. Julianne Grima, from Victim Support Malta, said: “Assessments are all well and good but it is the interpretation of that information that is crucial along with an assessment of the verbal and non-verbal information we receive from the victim and the alleged perpetrator.” Women’s Rights Foundation founder Lara Dimitrijevic said DASH in principle is an important and welcome tool to assess the risk a person may be facing within an intimate partner context. However, the tool should be used as an indicator and not as the basis upon which the police and professionals ought to rely on. “From experience, victims have often disclosed that, when doing a risk assessment following a police report, they, at times, either do not feel comfortable to disclose certain incidents or, at the time and in the state of shock they are in, do not come forward with past incidents and threats,” she said. “This, of course, is a natural process whereby body and mind shut down as a form of protection and should never be interpreted as not wanting to cooperate. “The law further states that, whenever a risk assessment is done, it is incumbent upon the police to further investigate and, upon due consideration, determine whether there is ‘a serious risk of harm’ following which they may arrest or, as the law provides, at the very least ask the courts for the issuance of a temporary protection order,” Dimitrijevic added.

Title: Public call for Msida Creek project works to be launched soon: prime minister
Body: A public call for works on the Msida Creek Project will be launched in a few months' time, Prime Minister Robert Abela promised on Sunday, telling supporters at the locality's Labour Party club that the place would be unrecognizable in two years' time.  Abela was replying to questions by ONE News editor Sandro Mangion at a question and answer session.  Last November, Infrastructure Malta published new plans for the project, which will feature a 2,200 square metre piazza in front of the parvis of St Joseph parish church, a 300-metre canal to address flooding issues and a flyover to ease traffic congestion.   “What I can say is that in a couple of years’ time, let us meet here once again and we will not even recognise the place,” Abela said.  Asked for his reaction to the findings of a recent survey showing that the crime rate was down, Abela welcomed the results but said more must be done to prevent crime. The figures published in the CrimeMalta Observatory Annual Crime Review showed that Malta registered the lowest crime rate in more than 15 years last year.  Police saw a significant drop in the total number of reported crimes year-on-year, with  5.4 per cent fewer reports filed than in 2021. “You might ask me, once we have such positive statistics, whether we should relax and take it easy? My reply would be absolutely not. I do not believe we should rest on our laurels as behind every criminal act there is a victim,” he said. Preventing crime was not only up to the police, he added. “We too play a role as individuals."   Abela also warned that a victim of crime should not become a victim once again through the judicial process.  “This is a reality we have seen happen before. A victim of a crime feels like a victim once more on going through the  investigation and judicial process instead of getting justice.” He also called for justice to be delivered in a more timely manner.  Delays were unacceptable because they are another form of injustice,” he said.  During the interview, Abela also announced that students following an apprenticeship will start to be paid an hourly rate equivalent to the minimum wage for the time spent during their apprenticeship work.    The decision had been taken as part of efforts by the government to address  concerns about a lack of human resources in various industries, he said.  He said students taking post-secondary courses that include around 600 hours of apprenticeship work will no longer get a reduced stipend but will receive their full stipend and grant, and the apprenticeship hours will be paid at the minimum wage.  “Around 1,000 students will benefit from this scheme, and we will ensure that such a promise will not only provide more opportunities for our youths but also improve their quality of life,” Abela said.  Abela also spoke about the European Council meeting which he attended in Brussels last  week.  He expressed concern that a year into the war in Ukraine, there was "no end in sight".

Title: Editorial: A false sense of security
Body: Reliable statistics are useful to plan for the future and make better decisions. However, they can also be perilous, especially when we forget that, in most cases, behind every number there is a human being. The risk is that, in seeking comfort in statistics, the authorities may adopt a false sense of security. The welcome headline news this week was that the crime rate has dropped to its lowest since 2004. All those who contributed to bring that about deserve to be commended. Still, we cannot rest on our laurels. A good look at the situation on the ground indicates there is a lot more work to be done. It is good to know that cases of theft, prostitution, forgery and bodily harm reported to the police have declined in number. On the other hand, crimes related to drugs, sexual offences, threats and private violence, perjury, fraud and computer misuse have been climbing over the past two decades. Technology-related crime is up too, and criminal activity is increasingly shifting online. So, although thefts from homes and vehicles may have fallen sharply, it does not mean that stealing is no longer a problem – fraud and online scams are on the increase. Criminals may no longer be targeting a wallet, purse or handbag but prefer to go for online bank accounts. Domestic violence reports are ballooning. The government and its advisors believe this is likely because public awareness and police resources have encouraged people to report more, rather than necessarily because domestic violence is increasing. Bernice Cassar’s family, to name just one tragic case, are not likely to share these views. When the latest crime statistics were released, the intended message to the people evi­dently was that the country is ‘safer’. That may be the case statistically, but many individuals have personal experiences that tell a different tale.   That, in a way, was confirmed by the home affairs minister himself when he said that, although news of appalling crimes lead people to believe the country is more dangerous, it is the facts emerging from the figures that must offer a view of the larger picture and guide the government in making decisions. One can only hope the government and its advisors are not blinded by the lights. But such comments, and statements made by Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà and criminology professor Saviour Formosa, indicate that is indeed the case. Gafà said the force saw a significant drop in bodily harm crimes in St Julian’s and Valletta. This just days after an unprovoked assault on a number of teenagers in the capital led the prime minister to publicly express safety concerns. “The figures render the islands very safe,” Formosa, who compiled the statistics, remarked in his report. The families of Paulina Dembska and Pelin Kaya, or the families of those whose life was cut short by violent partners even after repeated reports to the police were made might beg to differ. So though, statistically, crime figures – based on cases reported to the authorities – are falling, safety fears in general are not. A study just conducted by the National Statistics Office found that eight of every 10 people in Malta think that, rather than manning police stations, officers should be out on the streets. While we are not suggesting Malta should turn into a police state, the people need to be assured that professional help is available when needed.

Title: Għajn Żnuber tower vandalised, a day after CCTV was disconnected
Body: The Għajn Żnuber tower was defaced with black oil during Friday’s stormy night, a day after CCTV watching over the historic building was stolen.  In a video posted by the HPF Ranger Unit on Facebook, the damage to the site is seen extending to the surrounding area as the black liquid trails over the stones and dirt around the tower.   "Used engine oil has been used," an HPF Ranger Unit spokesperson said. Also known as Ta' Ciantar farmhouse or Ta' Torri Ciantar, the area in Mellieħa has been closed off by rangers who asked to relay any information to the police. The act of vandalism could have been pre-meditated. On Thursday morning, the ranger unit reported that the CCTV monitoring the tower had been cut down and the camera stolen. A spokesperson for the HPF Ranger Unit said the loss of the camera coupled with the extreme weather in which the vandalism occurred may point to a pre-planned act. In 2012, restorations began for the tower, which saw it being transformed from a crippled lookout post to what it is today. The structure is believed to have been built in the late 19th century. It was last used during the Second World War as a lookout post. After the war, the tower was abandoned and suffered from neglect and vandalism.

Title: More than 60 stolen cars intercepted in Malta returned to Canada
Body: More than 60 cars stolen in Canada and discovered by Malta Customs hidden inside shipping containers have been repatriated. On Friday, Canadian news outlet CTV News reported that the 64 stolen vehicles, which have a combined estimated value of CAD$3.5 million (€2.46m), have been returned to the Greater Toronto Area. It took almost a year-and-a-half to settle paperwork to ensure the cars’ return – “a long wait to come back home,” the Canadian news outlet noted. Thieves working with organised crime groups stole the cars, many of which are luxury SUVs and pick-ups, with the intention of shipping them to buyers in Africa and the United Arab Emirates. Cars were mainly stolen off residential driveways. In many cases, thieves used loop antennas to amplify and relay a signal from a key fob kept inside the house to another device near the car to open its doors and start the engine. In other, more violent cases, thieves took control of vehicles through car-jackings across the Greater Toronto Area. Car theft was up 44 per cent in 2022 in the region. Toronto police believe several hundred such vehicles were successfully smuggled abroad and sold to unsuspecting buyers. A significant number of the cars stolen and smuggled abroad were however intercepted by Malta Customs in a string of seizures stretching back to October 2021. The most recent such interception was reported last December, when 19 such cars were found hidden inside a shipping container en route to Dubai.  Toronto police have made dozens of arrests as part of what it has dubbed 'Project Majestic'. Among those charged are nine who are being prosecuted in connection with the car seizures in Malta.

Title: Harvey Weinstein rape victim sues for damages
Body: A woman who was raped a decade ago by Harvey Weinstein is suing the disgraced movie producer for damages, according to a lawsuit lodged Thursday in Los Angeles. Weinstein was convicted in December of attacking the woman, who has not been named, in a Beverly Hills hotel room. The Oscar-winning former producer, 70, is already serving a 23-year sentence for his 2020 conviction in New York for sex crimes. At a hearing expected this month in Los Angeles he faces a possible further 18-year term, increasing the likelihood the Pulp Fiction producer will spend the rest of his life in prison, even as he appeals both cases. His victim on Thursday claimed unspecified damages, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. “The conduct of Defendant Weinstein was despicable, and done with malice, oppression and fraud, thus justifying an award of punitive damages against him,” the lawsuit says. After his conviction in New York, a civil trial awarded $17 million to dozens of women who had accused the former movie magnate of abuse. The plaintiff in Thursday’s suit was not among them. Rumors of Weinstein’s behaviour had circulated in Hollywood for years, but his position at the apex of the industry meant few were prepared to challenge him. That all changed in 2017 with the publication of bombshell allegations against him, ushering in the #MeToo movement and opening the floodgates for women to speak out against sexual violence in the workplace. Dozens of women have since alleged they fell victim to Weinstein’s predatory behaviour. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Anger and grief in Quebec after bus rams day care, killing two 
Body: A driver charged with first-degree murder after ramming his bus into a daycare centre in Canada and killing two children was ordered Thursday to undergo psychiatric evaluation, as mourners laid flowers and lit candles for the victims. Pierre Ny St-Amand, 51, faces nine counts and is scheduled to appear in court again on February 17. "He is so far presumed fit to appear," Karine Dalphond, the prosecutor in charge of the case, told AFP. In the city of Laval, a suburb of Montreal, incomprehension and anger dominated a day after St-Amand drove his bus into the nursery as some parents were dropping off their children. Mourners - among them Canadian politicians, Laval residents and people who had travelled from other cities - came to lay flowers or stuffed toys and to light candles at the site as well as at a nearby church. "It's a terrible tragedy, I've been speechless since yesterday," said Yannick Lebeau, who came with his wife from their home 20 kilometres away to pay tribute.  His wife Annick Belisle, a teacher for 20 years, was in tears at his side. She called the deaths "senseless." "Words fail me to express how infinitely sad it is, it's terrible," said Laval resident and mother of two Veronique Chamberland. The daycare suffered serious damage, with part of its facade broken and covered with plywood. Debris was still scattered over the ground Thursday.   Some of the children were trapped under the bus before being freed.  One child died on the scene and another in an ambulance, authorities said, while a further six children were rushed to hospital but have since been deemed out of danger. "If there is a day when we must show that all of Quebec is behind those who lived this terrible tragedy, it was today," said provincial premier Francois Legault, who visited the scene.  "There is nothing harder than losing a child. How do you go on living?" he added.  "It was really a hard, dramatic day. We just spoke with some of the parents and they showed an unimaginable level of courage," said Canadian Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino. St-Amand appeared briefly at a hearing Wednesday, hours after the tragedy, where he refused to speak but nodded to answer the judge's questions, smiling broadly and repeatedly trying to sit up from the bed to which he was handcuffed. Witnesses who tried to subdue him after the crash said he was acting erratically, including removing all his clothes. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Record amount of cocaine seized by police last year as drug grows in popularity
Body: A record of nearly 3,000 kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of €386 million, were seized by the police last year as the drug continues to grow in popularity in Malta. This is almost three times the amount seized in 2021, which had been a record year. In their efforts to crack down on the chain of organised crime groups that work together to import, package and sell the drug, the police charged 54 people with trafficking cocaine last year.   “We are seeing an increase in cocaine use, as the statistics show,” police superintendent Keith Arnaud, who heads the drug squad, told Times of Malta. Cocaine is the second most consumed illicit drug in the EU after cannabis and Malta is no exception. “In the past, there were years when ecstasy was more popular in clubs but, today, its use has dropped drastically whereas that of cocaine is increasing,” Arnaud said. He said the police received reports of people consuming cocaine at weddings, private parties and bars where officers have even caught people sniffing in bathrooms.   Nearly a third of those in treatment reported cocaine was the drug that created most problems for them, up from 15 per cent in 2015, according to figures from 2020 collected by local NGOs providing drug rehabilitation services. Additionally, the proportion of people receiving treatment for using cocaine for the first time increased from 36 per cent in 2015 to 52 per cent in 2020.   Stopping drug use is “harder than it seems” because the moment a police officer is spotted the evidence is removed, Arnaud said. Malta is a small place and, even in plain clothes, drug squad members are easily recognised. The priority of the police, Arnaud added, was to get the drug off the streets, so they were focusing their resources on cracking down on organised crime groups (OCG). At least three of them are involved in the cocaine trade in the country, he said. Some of the groups have strong connections with European and international networks which coordinate the importation of cocaine, either in containers or through couriers and body-packers. The groups are usually made up of people of various nationalities that could include Maltese.  RELATED STORIES  “It is not the same group taking cocaine to the end users,” Arnaud said. “They would sell it to another – the middle group – that cuts it and sells it to other groups. It is then packed into smaller packets for the end user after adding more cutting agents.” At each step, the purity decreases as they cut the cocaine to make their money. So, by the time the drug gets to the end user it contains lots of “rubbish” – the cutting agents. Apart from the damage of taking the cocaine itself, there have been cases of drug users ending up in hospital and suffering long-term health problems resulting from the mix of chemicals, Arnaud said. And, as the quality drops along the process, the street value rockets. “From the information we get from the streets, a gramme of cocaine costs €50. Evidence shows that, higher up the chain, a kilo costs between €45,000 and €55,000. That same kilo ends up becoming various kilos with a street value of some €130,000.” Arnaud notes that the bulk of cocaine which makes its way into Europe comes from South America, West Asia and North Africa. Of course, while some just passes through Malta, some is meant for the local market.   One of the most common ways of smuggling cocaine into Malta remains the use of so-called body-packers – travellers who ingest capsules of cocaine and come here on a flight or by sea. This is one of the main challenges facing the drug squad. The only way cocaine can enter the island is by air or sea. People coming from Schengen areas, where there is freedom of movement, have a right to enter the country without border checks. And, according to law, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that a person is carrying drugs to check them or their property. Often, this “suspicion” stems from police intelligence provided from international law enforcement agencies or through anonymous tips. Another challenge is the use of private boats. “In the past, the police found cocaine brought to Malta on private vessels but it is impossible to stop everyone and be everywhere,” Arnaud said. Over the past few month, Arnaud noted, drug squad police have disrupted several OCGs. They busted cocaine packaging operations in houses fully equipped to package and traffic drugs and stopped traffickers from selling from cars and other places. Some traffickers, he said, hid the cocaine in public places. He said it was difficult to tell how many organised crime groups there are. Some are stronger than others, often due to their networks and the quality of their drugs. “Things could change fast. If a group has had their supply cut off following a seizure, for example, buyers could shift to another supplier,” Arnaud said, adding that there have been clashes between groups over this issue.  RELATED STORIES  “Our priority is getting the drugs off the streets. We are also focusing on seizing the proceeds of crime – we attack the assets it generates. This makes us more efficient as we are not only removing drugs from the streets, we are making it harder for groups to grow and get more organised,” he said. Arnaud noted that the drug squad doubled the cash it seized from organised crime groups between 2021 and 2022, from some €500,000 to about €1.1 million. Apart from the drug money seized, the groups were stripped of the value of the drugs. What happens to all the kilos when they are confiscated? Once seized, the drugs are taken into the custody of the police and then the law courts following a rigorous chain of custody procedures. If a person is charged over a specific drug seizure, the drugs are kept as evidence and destroyed once the case is over. If no one is charged, the drugs are incinerated in a documented process once the magisterial inquiry is concluded. As for the cash, it is kept as evidence until required and then it is forfeited in favour of the government. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'Helpless and lost' woman accused of theft
Body: A homeless woman with a serious drug problem wept in court as she was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to theft on Tuesday afternoon. Investigations concerning Bernice Decelis, 34, started last year following a report on October 12 about gold items having gone missing from her mother’s Sta Venera home. Months later, police received another report about theft from a car parked in Triq Bajjada, Marsa on January 25. Footage from that area showed a woman making off with a bag containing cash and fruit from the vehicle, explained prosecuting Inspector Mark Cremona. That woman was subsequently identified as Decelis. She was arrested on Monday.   During her interrogation, she fully cooperated and admitted that she had resorted to theft as well as prostitution so as to fuel her drug addiction, the inspector testified.  But on Tuesday, the slight-framed woman, dressed all in black, pleaded not guilty to both instances of aggravated theft as well as breaching bail conditions. Her lawyer, Daniel Attard, did not request bail but requested the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, to direct the prisons director to afford the accused all necessary help so as to overcome her addiction. As the hearing came to an end, the accused broke down, saying that she felt helpless and lost. Inspector Elisia Scicluna also prosecuted.

Title: South Korea jails man for 40 years in high-profile stalking, murder case
Body: A South Korean court sentenced a man to 40 years in prison on Tuesday for murdering a woman he had stalked for years, in a high-profile case that prompted calls for legal reform. Seoul's Central District Court found 31-year-old Jeon Joo-hwan guilty of killing a former colleague in revenge after the victim reported him to police for stalking. Over almost two years, Jeon followed and threatened the woman on more than 300 separate occasions but he was never detained despite her filing repeated complaints, as police deemed him "low risk". On September 14 last year, a day before Jeon was due to be sentenced for stalking the woman, he stabbed her to death in a public restroom at a subway station in central Seoul, the court found. "From the defendant's testimony it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle" the stalking charge, the court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap News Agency. "Despite the victim's wish to cut ties, the defendant forced her to suffer stalking and committed a revenge crime... instead of reflecting on his misdeeds." The killing prompted South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol, the country's former top prosecutor, to call on the justice ministry to improve laws on stalking to "better protect the victims and ensure such crimes won't happen again". Prosecutors in the case had called for the death penalty, arguing that Jeon could "likely commit extreme crimes like murder in the future due to his egocentrism when he feels anger against others", the JoongAng Daily newspaper reported. But the court ruled the defendant's young age meant he could still reflect and atone for his crimes. In his final court testimony, Jeon apologised to the victim's family "for causing them so much pain". The failure to take Jeon into custody after the victim's repeated complaints sparked widespread shock and alarm in South Korea and prompted enraged demands for officials to deal with such cases more strictly. Jeon reportedly told investigators he had been angered by the legal problems his victim had caused him. He had been fired from his job at the Seoul Metro - where the woman also worked - after she first reported him for stalking. Jeon was already in jail before being handed his murder sentence on Tuesday, having earlier been handed nine years for the stalking. The sentences will be served consecutively.

Title: Brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio found guilty of money laundering
Body: Updated 4.58pm with the court's findings. Brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, the hitmen sentenced for their role in Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder, have been found guilty of money laundering and condemned to a four-year effective jail term each. They were also fined €25,000 each.  Together with George Degiorgio's partner, Anca Adelina Pop, the two brothers were charged with money laundering after investigations into Caruana Galizia's murder led to further criminal action against the brothers.  Since then, the Degiorgios have pleaded guilty to their role as hitmen in the assassination, subsequently filing an application to cancel the trial.  On Tuesday morning, Magistrate Joe Mifsud  also found them guilty of money laundering.  Pop was acquitted.  In a 91-page judgment, the court also ordered the confiscation of a Mercedes vehicle and the leisure boat Maya belonging to Alfred Degiorgio.  An Audi car and pleasure craft Ducu registered in the other brother's name were also confiscated.  A Corvette convertible registered in Pop's name was also seized since the vehicle was effectively under her partner's control.   When delivering judgment the court observed that the Degiorgio brothers had produced “no plausible or lawful explanation” for the assets accumulated when their only lawful source of income were social benefits. George Degiorgio’s bank account lay dormant since 2005, while he also had a bank loan and he was last gainfully occupied in 1982 when he worked in construction for a few months. Yet, he covered tuition expenses for two children at a private school and purchased a yacht, the Maya, in 2017 for €30,000 in cash and registered it in his brother’s name. He also owned another vessel, the Ducu, along with an Audi A4, a Mitsubishi L200 and a BMW 360D between 2013 and 2016. His only lawful income between 2002 and 2018 were €104,600 derived from social benefits. He was not registered for tax purposes and had no VAT number. His brother Alfred lived in a rented apartment between August 2017 and November 2018, paying the landlord €800 monthly, always on time and in cash. Between 2009 and 2019, he gambled some €600,000 at local casinos making more losses than winnings. Between 2002 and 2018, he got €20,596.50 in social benefits, declared no income for tax purposes for the last 12 years, had no VAT number and no active bank accounts. During the proceedings, the brothers were silent and produced no evidence to prove that their assets and funds were from a legitimate source, the court observed. Moreover, they both had previous brushes with the law and were no newcomers in court, observed Magistrate Mifsud, finding sufficient evidence to prove the charge of recidivism. Matters were different as far as Pop was concerned. Although she had four cars registered in her name and was registered as self employed but never filed a tax return, charges against her were pinned solely upon the assertion that she benefited from her partner’s assets. Yet the prosecution failed to prove the link between the funds at her disposal and any criminal activity. She had a clean criminal record and was never criminally investigated, nor was there any indication “even remotely” that she was somehow involved in any criminal activity, the court said.  The fact that she had been with a partner, for some eight years or so, who was cast under a shadow over his possible involvement in criminal activities, was not enough, observed the court. It would have been a completely different story had the woman been even “passively aware” of her partner’s alleged criminal activity in such manner as to suspect that the funds he gave her were possibly derived from an illicit source. Rather, her defence produced and clearly explained the source of her funds, bringing her father and ex-husband to testify in the case. A series of transactions amounting to €38,450.50 were effected over a span of five years, each transaction never exceeding €450. Between 2013 and 2016 she received €17,700 from George Degiorgio who was at the time receiving social benefits for the couple’s child. And as for the Corvette registered in her name, she only learnt about it when she received an overspeeding ticket. On both occasions when police flagged down that vehicle, the driver was George Degiorgio and not his partner, observed the court, concluding that Pop was to be acquitted. Inspector Lianne Bonello prosecuted. Lawyers Roberto Montalto and Roberto Spiteri were counsel for Pop. Lawyer Noel Bianco stepped in for the Degiorgios at judgment stage.

Title: Editorial: Crime history repeating itself
Body: “This is a country that is accepting that crimes happen without being solved,” Kevin Grech was quoted saying, 45 years after his teenage sister was killed by a parcel bomb sent to their home. His painful declaration is no doubt shared by the loved ones of victims of the impunity that reigned supreme – as it still does – over the years and on the watch of different administrations. It ranges from the violence and oppression of the most turbulent times in this country’s political history to the many instances where the colour of money has been brighter than the rule of law. Karin Grech, Lino Cauchi and Raymond Caruana come to mind immediately but there could be others. To this very day, their families continue to express deep sorrow at having been abandoned by the state. Compensation, when given, is hardly adequate to bring closure. Sadly, history keeps repeating itself. Though overall crimes rates are down, there remains a clear problem with crimes committed with the involvement of the state or its ‘agents’. That emerges very clearly when reading the judgment awarding €615,000 to Cauchi’s heirs and comparing it to the conclusions drawn by the public inquiry into Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder. The findings of the Caruana Galizia are still fresh in everybody’s minds and do not need repeating but it bears quoting some of the comments made by Mr Justice Francesco Depasquale in his judgment a few days ago. “… Lino Cachi was murdered because he knew too much about the intrigue and corruption committed by Lorry Sant, Pio Camilleri and their clique… “At this stage, the court notes that the whole investigation, from Lino Cauchi’s death, presumably on February 15, 1982 to this day demonstrates a total failure in the way the investigation was conducted, which failure means that, today, it is almost impossible for Lino Cauchi’s family to ever know what Lino Cauchi actually went through… “It results that the state failed [Cauchi’s] family throughout the whole process of the investigation but, particularly, in the first months and years after Lino Cauchi’s death by refusing to commence investigations by the inquiring magistrate and, instead, kept everything under its control and, thus, essential evidence that could have been compiled in the first hours and days after Lino Cauchi’s disappearance has been lost forever.” As happened in the Bidnija murder, the police had also tried to derail investigations by working on the theory that Cauchi could have left the country because of money he owed. The only arrest the police made – bar much later, in 2001, when Camilleri was held after information they had received – was that of Cauchi’s wife, about a year after his disappearance. She was arrested for about nine hours after the investigator at the time, Anġlu Farrugia, thought she looked very calm when she posed for photographs for the press. The message emerging from such awful episodes is that people must put pressure on the powers that be for any meaningful action to be taken. A lot depends on the rule of law and the separation of powers. As Chief Justice Emeritus Vincent Degaetano had enunciated in a speech in late 2021, for separation of powers to be practical and effective, such power cannot be “concentrated in the hands of one individual or a number of individuals and, more importantly, that those enacting the law are not the same as those deciding on its application in practice”. The implementation of laws by state agents must be subject to independent verification and checks, he also insisted. Perhaps, then, criminal history will not repeat itself with such ease.

Title: Cardona claims: Police say they probe all criminal allegations
Body: The police have insisted they investigate all allegations of a criminal nature, in light of testimony linking former government minister Chris Cardona to an alleged plot to kill Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2014. The alleged plot was aborted and Caruana Galizia was killed three years later in car bomb attack in 2017. Self-confessed killer Vince Muscat, known as Il-Koħħu, claimed in court last week that he drove fellow killer George Degiorgio to meet Cardona and discuss killing the journalist back in 2014. Muscat is serving a 15-year sentence for his role in the 2017 assassination of the investigative journalist while Degiorgio was sentenced to 40 years in jail for his part in the killing. Muscat said he did not see Cardona during this 2014 meeting at Portomaso, having just dropped off Degiorgio at a nearby roundabout. “He [Degiorgio] did not tell me anything else. But those €150,000 came from there. In truth, I never saw Cardona, but George told me that those €150,000 were coming from Cardona,” Muscat said.  The 2014 murder plot was eventually abandoned, with another plot hatched in 2017, allegedly at the behest of renowned businessman Yorgen Fenech.  Following his arrest for the journalist’s murder, Fenech had initially tried to pin the October 2017 car bombing on Cardona, before changing his version of events by blaming the murder on ex-OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri. A spokesperson for the force told Times of Malta that the police investigate all allegations of a criminal nature that come to its attention. Cardona was briefly questioned by police after he was first mentioned by Fenech in November 2019. Fenech later claimed that the plan to pin the murder plot on Cardona was hatched by Schembri. Schembri, too, was arrested and released that same month. Fenech’s arrest led to the collapse of ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat’s administration. Both Muscat and Schembri stepped down as a result of the Tumas magnate’s arrest, while Cardona “suspended” himself from his cabinet post. Muscat’s successor, Robert Abela, declined to reappoint Cardona to cabinet, and also forced his hand to resign as Labour’s deputy leader. Testifying in the public inquiry into Caruana Galizia’s assassination, Cardona dismissed claims he had advanced knowledge of the murder, saying attempts to link him to the plot were a “frame-up”. In the months prior to the assassination, Cardona had pushed back at blog posts by Caruana Galizia stating he had visited a brothel while in Germany on government work. Cardona reacted to the series of blog posts by suing the journalist and putting a freeze on her assets. He has also denied knowing the Degiorgio brothers in a social context, instead insisting he came into contact with them through his legal work.

Title: Malta's crime rate drops to lowest since 2004
Body: Malta registered the lowest crime rate in more than 15 years last year, according to statistics published on Monday. With 28 crimes committed for every 1,000 people, 2022 was technically a safer year for the average citizen than any other since Malta joined the European Union. The one exception was 2020, an anomalous year which saw the entire country temporarily shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Comparisons with years prior to 2004 are difficult, as statistics were not gathered using the same methodology prior to that date.  Police also saw a significant drop in the total number crimes year-on-year, with 5.4 per cent fewer reports filed than in 2021, despite Malta's growing population.  The figures were published in the CrimeMalta Observatory Annual Crime Review and made public by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà at a press conference at the police headquarters in Floriana. Launched in 2008, CrimeMalta gatheres statistics on crime rates. It has been publishing the figures annually since 2017. The figures, compiled and presented by University criminology professor Saviour Formosa, show that in 2022, people filed 14,933 crime reports, versus the roughly 20,000 that experts were predicting.    Had the crime rate remained at 2004 levels, when there were 45 criminal reports filed per 1,000, then Malta would have had to contend with 24,000 crimes last year, Formosa noted.   The report also says that theft has dramatically halved - from 11,465 in 2004 to 4,612 in 2022 - and that all homicides between 2018 and 2022 were solved in a matter of days.   "The figures render the islands very safe, where crimes declined from 45 crimes per 1000 persons in 2004 to 37 crimes per 1000 persons in 2012 to 28 crimes per 1000 persons in 2022, the lowest on record," Formosa said in his report, adding that last year's record-low figures even include figures for crimes related to immigration, drugs and money laundering, all of which were not included in previous statistics.   The report highlights a rapidly changing crime scenario. While in 2004 almost two out of every three crimes (62.4%) was a theft, that figure dropped to 55.6% in 2012 and now stands at just 30.9%.  Apart from theft, incidents of prostitution, arson, attempted offences, forgery and bodily harm have also dropped since 2012. By contrast, crimes related to drugs, sexual offences, threats and private violence, perjury, fraud and computer misuse have all been on the rise over the past two decades. Reports of fraud and computer misuse have seen especially dramatic rises, climbing by 876% and 4164% respectively, the report notes. Malta's homicide rate continues to hover where it has always been since 2004, according to the report. It remained at a constant 1.7 per 100,000 persons. Arson is now at a record low, with 73% fewer reports than in 2004.  Conversely, technology-related crimes are up, with criminal activity increasingly shifting online. Last year the police registered 470 'computer crimes' the police commissioner said. There was a 21% decrease in thefts from private residences since 2008, but an increase in fraud reports - from 11 in 2004 to 469 in 2022 - and an increase in drug reports - from 87 in 2004 to 210 in 2022. Domestic violence reports also ballooned, going up from 450 reports in 2008 to 1,830 in 2022. There was also an increase of 5% in the number of domestic violence reports filed when compared to 2021.   Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said the government and its advisors believe this is likely because public awareness and police resources have encouraged people to report more, and not necessarily because domestic violence is increasing. Gafà also said that police saw a significant drop in bodily harm crimes in key hotspots St Julian's and Valletta.  In St Julian's, the rate of bodily harm crime report was the third-lowest in 25 years, with only 2020 and 2021 - when most bars were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic - registering lower rates.  "In 2011, there were three times as many bodily harm cases in St Julian's as last year," the commissioner said.  Valletta also saw a 20% drop in such crime when compared to 2011, he said.  No locality registered abnormal spikes in crime, but there was a slight increase in reports in Floriana, Valletta, Cospicua and Żejtun. Gozo, however, registered an 8% increase in crime reports - 73 more reports over the previous year. But addressing recent reports in Times of Malta over a spike of thefts in Gozo, Police Commissioner Gafà said that figures show that theft on the sister island is also down, with 199 such reports last year, the third lowest after the two Covid years and the high of 332 in 2006.     Gafa also said the police drug squad prosecuted 22% more drug cases last year and seized half a million euro more in cash from drug-related activity - double the amount seized the previous year. Over the last two decades, there were fewer prostitution-related crimes but more pornography-related ones. There was also an increase, of 6% year-on-year, in reports relating to threats and private violence, increasing mainly through blackmail, causing fear of violence, private violence and stalking. Crimes relating to computer misuse, fraud, perjury and false swearing, abuse of public authority and immigration also increased, while crimes relating to arson, attempted offences and violation of places of confinement decreased. Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said that while news of appalling crimes often shocks people to the core and leads them to believe that the country has become more dangerous, it is the facts emerging from these figures that must offer a view of the larger picture and guide government in taking decisions. "We're not trying to say that the country is perfect, but we are seeing encouraging results," he said. "We thought that with the growing economy, the creation of more jobs and the increase in population, we would be registering more crime. The fact that we're not means that society is more educated and aware and our efforts are working." Both he and Gafà cited a drive to shift police work to a community-based model as part of the reason for the declining crime rate. Community policing, which currently covers 75 per cent of the country and will go nationwide by the end of this year, sees more officers assigned community beats.  During the press conference, the National Statistics Office also announced preliminary results of a survey commissioned by the police force. The survey shows that the majority of people - 80% - prefer police officers patrolling the streets over police officers manning police stations, but the majority - 57% - said they do not see officers in the street often enough. According to the survey, the majority trust the police and have confidence in their services. 68% are aware of community policing and residents in localities where the initiative has already kicked off are more aware of the concept. 68% of residents in localities with community policing said they saw improvements in security in their locality.

Title: Temporary memorial for murder victim Paulina Dembska vandalised 
Body: A temporary memorial for a Polish student who was raped and murdered in Sliema just over a year ago has been vandalised.  Paulina Dembska, 29, was killed in Independence Gardens, Sliema, on January 2 last year. Abner Aquilina, 21, is pleading not guilty to the crime.  The murder horrified the nation and led to a change of legislation to introduce the concept of femicide in the criminal code.  Last month, on the anniversary of her murder, a temporary memorial was set up close to the site where she was killed. It included a picture of Paulina and a poem.  Friends and wellwishers held a Mass at nearby St Gregory’s Parish Church on the anniversary followed by a vigil on the site.  Pictures uploaded on social media on Tuesday evening showed that the memorial had been vandalised - someone left scratch marks on  Paulina's picture, specifically on her eyes.   Her friend, Agnieszka Gramala, who uploaded the pictures, appealed to artists to collaborate with her to create a more permanent structure for her late friend. "The response was immediate, for which we are grateful," Gramala told Times of Malta.   RELATED STORIES  "Together with Daria, Paulina’s sister, we have already started talking to an artist who contacted us herself and showed great empathy and willingness to participate in the initiative. It’s uplifting." She said she took the picture of the vandalised memorial on Sunday, as she visits the memorial site often. "It saddens and upsets me. Such behaviour cannot be accepted and ignored," she said. She said the family and herself had been considering a more permanent memorial and the vandalism led them to act sooner. Last year, a group of female artists also got together to paint a colourful mural at the entrance of the garden where Paulina was murdered.

Title: Why aren't 16-year-olds sentenced as adults, if they can vote and marry?
Body: Comments by a magistrate about the need to amend criminal laws related to minors has reignited the debate over the age at which minors should be held criminally responsible for their crimes.  Speaking during ongoing proceedings against two 16-year-olds charged with assault, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech said that although 16-year-olds are allowed to get married, run for office and even vote in national elections, they are nevertheless considered minors when it comes to criminal punishment. The magistrate’s comments prompted a response from Prime Minister Robert Abela, who said, "The reason our law grants an attenuation to minors is due to considerations tied with the charter of the Council of Europe”. The age of criminal responsibility, or the age at which a person can be charged with a criminal offence, is established in articles 35 through 37 of Malta’s Criminal Code.  The law sets the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 14, meaning that no person under that age can be charged with a criminal offence. However, the law also allows for the child’s parents or guardians to be held responsible for the child’s offence.   Children between the ages of 14 and 16 can be held charged with a crime, but may also be exempt from criminal responsibility if the courts decide that the offence has not been committed with malice, or what the law describes as mischievous discretion. In order to establish that there is mischievous discretion, the courts need to determine that the child is conscious of their wrongdoing and of the impacts of their actions. In such cases, the child may be convicted of a crime but will receive a sentence which is decreased by one or two degrees. Children between the ages of 16 and 18, on the other hand, do not have any exemption and are automatically considered to be aware of and criminally responsible for their actions, in the same way as adults.   The law, however, grants them greater leniency in sentencing compared to adults, and they will receive a sentence that is decreased by one or two degrees - the same leniency afforded to those aged 14 to 16.  Maltese law sets out a scale of imprisonment, consisting of fifteen degrees of punishment, the highest being a period of imprisonment ranging from 10 to 40 years, and the lowest being from one to three months.  A decreased sentence means that if an adult were to be convicted with a punishment of the first degree (10 to 40 years imprisonment), a minor would see their sentence decreased to either the second degree (eight to 30 years imprisonment) or the third degree (seven to 20 years) for the same crime. These age thresholds were established in 2014, when Malta’s age of criminal responsibility was raised following recommendations by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Malta’s previous minimum age of criminal responsibility stood at nine, meaning anyone over the age of nine could be charged with a crime. Children between the ages of nine and 14 could be held criminally responsible in cases where mischievous discretion was proven. Youths between the ages of 14 and 18 were tried as adults but would receive reduced sentences.  Lawyers who spoke to Times of Malta explained that European or international legislation does not specify how old minors should be before they are held criminally responsible, or whether they should be subject to decreased sentences. That means it is up to each country to establish its own minimum age of criminal responsibility.  Nonetheless, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child does establish some parameters within which persons under 18 can be tried or sentenced.  The convention states that offenders aged under 18 should not be sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. It also stresses that the “arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time”. An analysis carried out by the Child Rights International Network suggests that Malta’s minimum age of criminal responsibility is broadly in line with several other European countries, where the minimum age is also set at 14.  However, several countries have lower ages of criminal responsibility. In Switzerland, children over the age of 10 can be charged with a crime, whilst Belgian and Dutch law sets the minimum age at 12. In Ireland, children under the age of 12 cannot be charged with a crime, except in cases of violent crime such as rape, murder and manslaughter, in which case children as young as 10 can be prosecuted. The UK has similar provisions, with Scotland and Northern Ireland both setting a minimum age of 10.  Europe’s highest minimum age of criminal responsibility is set at 15, with several Scandinavian countries adopting this limit, together with Poland and the Czech Republic.   Speaking to Times of Malta, Children’s Commissioner Antoinette Vassallo pointed to the fact that a 16 or 17-year-old is still considered a child in both in the eyes of local law and of the UN’s Convention of the Rights of the Child. She argued that “children are impressionable by nature, more vulnerable and susceptible to negative pressure and the court is duty bound to take this into consideration since children are still in their formative years.  “Even though children are given more responsibilities as they get older, the ages between 16 and 18 are crucial and act as a transitional period from childhood to adulthood. This is a very critical period in which children still need protection and support”, she said. These concerns were echoed by a lawyer specialising in child’s law who spoke to Times of Malta. “When one deals with minors one has to balance restorative justice with juvenile law and make sure not to get minors entrapped in the criminal system when they could have been rehabilitated instead," the lawyer said.   Criminal lawyers, on the other hand, had a slightly different view, saying that although it was justified for minors to receive decreased sentences, the age thresholds for such punishments are in need of revision. Today’s 14 and 15-year-olds are more aware of the impacts of their actions than ever, so the court’s ability to deliver stricter sentences should reflect this reality, they argued.   One legal concern flagged by Vassallo is the fact that minors can be tried as adults, if they are accused together with adults of the same offence. Her office has been pushing to address this anomaly, she told Times of Malta. A prominent example is the charges brought against the El Hiblu 3, a group of three teenagers aged 15, 16 and 19 charged with hijacking a ship in 2019. All three are being charged before a magistrate's court, despite two of them being minors, with human rights NGO Aditus also noting that they were held at an adult wing of prison while in preventative custody for seven months.

Title: UK sounds alarm over child exposure to violent porn
Body: A UK government-sponsored report on Tuesday sounded the alarm over children viewing violent pornography, warning that, as a result, they may expect sex to include acts such as strangulation. The report from Children's Commissioner Rachel de Souza found 10% of children had seen pornography by the age of nine and 79% had seen violent pornography "depicting coercive, degrading or pain-inducing sex acts" by the age of 18. The survey was carried out late last year among 1,014  people aged from 16 to 21 living in England. A total 47% said girls "expect" sex to include physical aggression such as airway restriction and slapping, and 42% said girls "enjoy" this. Respondents were more likely to think girls enjoy such acts than boys do. Among the respondents aged over 18, 47% said they had experienced a violent sexual act. "A lot of online pornography can be unrealistic and some of it is rape content, so young people may think this is okay and realistic," an 18-year-old girl was quoted as saying. The report stresses that the content children can view now bears no comparison to what their parents' generation could access only in top-shelf magazines. It argues that among young people, "pornography plays a key role in normalising and condoning sexual violence against women". The report is released as lawmakers consider an Online Safety Bill to introduce stricter age controls to stop under-18s seeing adult content. The children's commissioner backs the legislation, while saying it "will not be a 'silver bullet'". She lambasted websites for not introducing such controls earlier. "Parents really can't stop the tide of this stuff on social media. It's the tech firms that need to step up and do this," de Souza told the BBC. "The online safety bill will force them to do it. But frankly, these are multi-billion pound companies, they should be having a moral compass and doing this now and they perfectly well can." The report found children were most likely to access porn on mainstream social media rather than dedicated adult porn sites.  Twitter was the most common source, with 41% saying they had seen it on the site, whose sign-up age is 13. Instagram and Snapchat were also cited. Parents were "often unaware that violent and degrading content can be found so quickly and easily on the internet". The report focused on the effects of children viewing pornography. Early exposure, aged 11 or younger, makes boys more likely to become frequent viewers. And it often "significantly increased the likelihood of viewing sexually violent content" later.

Title: Pelin Kaya's colleagues recall murder victim as 'a true friend'
Body: Colleagues of Pelin Kaya, the Turkish woman murdered on her birthday in Gżira earlier this month, joined her grieving family in court on Monday as the case against her alleged killer began.  “I miss her voice, she had such a calming voice and I know that everybody misses her so much at work,” her colleague Vincenzo told reporters on Monday.  Vincenzo worked with Kaya at a Birkirkara furniture store and was among work colleagues to join family members for Monday's court case. “We want everybody to know we loved her. She was not just a colleague but a true friend," he said.    Pelin, a 30-year-old interior designer, was walking home after a birthday celebration on January 18, when a car ploughed into her before crashing into a petrol station and a KFC restaurant.  On Monday, the court heard how she was walking to meet her boyfriend at the time. The boyfriend came across police and first responders as he went to meet her. He only discovered she had died when he called her, and the phone at the scene of the crime began to ring.  Members of the Turkish community were also present outside the law courts on Monday and carried banners that read 'Justice delayed is justice denied' and 'It was not an accident. It was a murder'.    Vincenzo and fellow colleague Alessandro recounted how Pelin had not shown up for work that day.     "She usually messages us when she is running late, but we heard nothing from her that morning," they recalled.  Once they read the news and realised that it was the victim's birthday, they expected the worse.  "She was always putting herself there to help any of us, she was so kind, and I will miss her so much," Alessandro said.  "Her energy was so good, she was always smiling, we will never forget that smile," Vincenzo added.  "She brought love and happiness every time she walked in (to work) in the morning. I was always looking forward to work to spend the day with her. She didn't deserve this." Her colleagues said Pelin had a lot of dreams and that she had come to Malta to find a better living.  "Her life is stopped, I see videos of her blowing the candles and I see her dreams in her eyes, and now they have vanished," Vincenzo said.  Alessandro added: "You never come to terms with the pain, but you just learn to cope with the pain and there is a hole in our hearts that cannot be filled."  Ahead of the sitting, the Kaya family gathered at the scene of the murder outside a petrol shop and KFC outlet. Her mother travelled to Malta to lay flowers at the scene and attend the court case.

Title: Pelin Kaya's mother visits Gżira murder site ahead of court sitting
Body: The grieving mother of Pelin Kaya, the young Turkish woman who was murdered on her birthday in Gżira earlier this month visited the site on Monday morning, hours before the compilation of evidence against the alleged murderer starts in court.  She also visited her office at OnePercent, hugging her desk. Pelin, an interior designer, was walking home after a birthday celebration on January 18, when a car ploughed into her before crashing into a petrol station and a KFC restaurant. CCTV footage of the incident showed the driver, Jeremie Camilleri, walking unscathed from the wreckage, before proceeding to hurl stones at the victim. The police tasered the driver before arresting him.  The victim's mother, Çiçek Kaya, wore a picture of Pelin around her neck as she laid a bouquet of flowers next to a picture of her daughter on the site.    "Mothers should not cry again because of something like this," she told reporters, adding that they deserve justice from the courts.   Camilleri has been accused of murder as well as other charges including resisting the police and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

Title: Bitter fruits – Anna Marie Galea
Body: I’ve been trying to steer away from nights out in Valletta for some time. It’s not because I don’t love our beautiful capital city, far from it, but, between the clashing, loud music every few metres, the hordes of people and the fact that there’s never anywhere to park, I’ve given up. It was a bit harder to enforce my usual veto during the Christmas season and I ended up going a few times. On one particular occasion, I remained more than a bit pensive about the city’s state of affairs, which was why I was so unsurprised when I read reports that four minors were attacked in Merchants Street. My story occurred when I walked into a popular eatery for a takeaway burger. It was packed to the rafters with teenagers and I had to struggle and force my way through to get to the counter. No amount of polite platitudes would budge anyone. I felt instantly unsafe with the way they seemed to be organised into packs and the way they spoke to each other. As I got to the counter, I saw a boy draped over it indolently, ignoring the cashier and seemingly intent on causing trouble. No one knew if he was there to order but the minute I stepped forward, I was met with a rude protest and that kind of bristling which you know could quickly turn into a fight. I didn’t know what to do, so I motioned for him to go first and eventually retrieved my burger and hotfooted it out of there. Had a fight broken out, I wouldn’t have stood a chance against him or his buddies.   Having experienced that, it’s very easy to imagine how quickly things must have escalated a few nights ago. Seemingly aimless, directionless and full of misplaced anger and aggression, gangs terrorising the capital city are not a new concept; however, it does feel more dangerous than when I was a teenager. Back then, you might have gotten spat at for looking at someone the wrong way but, now, it would seem that merely existing is more than enough to enrage and incite a brawl. The worst part is that our institutions know all about this and, yet, no real steps are ever taken, with people even claiming the police discourage you from making reports. Whether you deem things dangerous or not, you can’t have packs of teenagers roaming the streets at all times of the day and night and not be willing to at least increase police presence. I mean, a few projects and initiatives to help harness and manage all the energy, trauma and fury these teenagers carry would also be welcome  but the least we can do now is try to stop situations like this from becoming the norm. I know that lawlessness seems to have become the order of the day in this country, as well as never ending court cases that, ultimately, find no one guilty, however, it would be lovely if we, at least, pretended to do something to protect our children from being stalked and randomly attacked for walking down the street. It would seem the seeds we sowed of the culture of impunity are already bearing their bitter fruits. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Unresolved childhood traumas – Andrew Azzopardi
Body: We have been throwing solutions left, right and centre as we witness one tragedy after another in this country. The blaming game is at its best. As always happens when there is a spike in criminality (actual or perceived) this leads to moral panic. Our reaction is not directed in trying to understand what is happening in our communities but we go into a frenzy and we start planting doubts in one institution after another as we try to untangle the chaos. The courts, the police, the educational system, the Church, a change in our morality are all tossed about as reasons for this professed profligacy. I believe the problem is too deep-rooted to be solved by simply exerting pressure on the courts or the police force. Putting people in prison and ‘throwing away the key’ is another absurdity. The recent cases of femicide, attempted murders, people being deliberately run over, gangs roaming the streets and regular brawls in our community need a more thorough analysis and scrutiny. One angle we need to look into is unresolved childhood traumas. The root of most of these evils is traceable to a lack of positive experiences during ‘our’ upbringing. In my, and a number of stakeholders’ opinion, this ‘trauma’ in social policy has not being given the importance it deserves. It is useless trying to heal a behaviour unless we know where it is coming from. Naturally, not all people who go through traumatic experiences in childhood are unable to get through life. However, engaging in the right type of therapy, support and help goes a long way in this healing process. The roots of trauma and why it is allowed to fester are varied.   In a discussion document I wrote following consultation with various experts I identified at least 100 potential traumas that can leave a lasting effect on children as they transition through life. To mention a few: refugee children, children who witness violence at home, adopted and fostered children, children who are bullied or abused sexually, children in care, children affected by poverty, children who have to visit their parents in a prison setting or testify in court, children who experience ill-health, children unable to play or come from different ethnic communities or religions, children who contemplate suicide and/or self-harm or who witness adults in these circumstances, and children who live in contexts where mental health is ripe. This calls for urgent action, the first being that of convincing leaders in the social sector of the very serious situation we are in. Quoting from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (US) website: “ACEs [Adverse Childhood Experiences] are common. About 61 per cent of adults surveyed across 25 states reported they had experienced at least one type of ACE before age 18 and nearly one in six reported they had experienced four or more types of ACEs.” It adds: “The economic and social costs to families, communities and society totals hundreds of billions of dollars each year.” I recommend we set up a task force to look into this matter that will include academics, social operators, professionals, and policymakers. It is imperative we have a national study to help us understand the extent of the problem within our society. We also need to have trauma specialists and trauma specialised training embedded in the curriculum of caring professions and we should include ongoing professional development. We need to reconstitute and strengthen the multidisciplinary teams in our schools, work with prison inmates more intensely and use non-formal education in the process of healing. This will complement access to psychotherapy, family therapy, psychological services and counselling. Instead of simply judging people or contemplating extreme measures for people who act criminally we need to address the problem at its core. If we do not deal with this matter appropriately, we will sadly be guaranteed more victims like Paulina, Bernice, Rita, Sion and Pelin.  Andrew Azzopardi is Dean at the Faculty for Social Well-being.

Title: Reaping what they sow – Claire Bonello
Body: In the wake of the horrific incident in Valletta where teenagers were attacked and injured by a gang of youths, Prime Minister Robert Abela called upon parents to raise their children with the correct morals and values. I find that a bit rich when the government has contributed to a state of affairs where wrongdoers and bullies are constantly rewarded and victims are abandoned to their fate with little hope of seeing any form of justice. Take the situation in Valletta for starters. In the past years,  the capital has become a tawdry, noisy hang-out where competing establishments take up more public space, the cacophony keeps residents up at night and gangs of youths mill about taunting passers-by. The relaxation of the regulations regarding the playing of music late at night was objected to by residents, to no avail. The encroachment onto public spaces? Too difficult to enforce due to a regulatory regime so fragmented that all authorities refuse to enter the fray. The gangs of youths? They’ve been there for some time – intimidating and inconveniencing others but there are no signs of effective policing dispersing them. Complaints to the police have resulted in the usual desultory fobbing off. Whether this is because the police are under-resourced or unmotivated, no one knows, but this scenario is repeated across the board every time anyone reports crime, law-breaking, harassment, nuisance, inconvenience and lack of adherence to regulations.  Victims are given short shrift and are deliberately ignored by the authorities. Is this the fault of parents failing to instil good values in their children? No. It is the fault of those government ministers who prefer to splurge taxpayers’ money on inflated direct orders to cronies and asinine projects instead of beefing up our enforcement systems. It is the fault of those government ministers who are so quick to pass a thicket of legislation setting up more useless state entities so they or their chosen ones can run personal fiefdoms, instead of passing laws which will make enforcement easier.   It is the fault of those government ministers who shrug off clear evidence of corruption which engulfs the nation, instead of setting the tone and showing that corrupt and unethical practices are not tolerated. The current breakdown and mayhem is not the fault of parents but the infants in government. The unfortunate thing about it is that we are reaping what they have sown. An endless saga of roadworks and buses stuck in traffic I watched the interview with Transport Minister Aaron Farrugia with equal measures of amusement and irritation. Questioned about the fact that our streets are still car-choked and that people still refuse to use the bus service because it is unreliable, Farrugia came up with the usual platitudes. He said there is no magic bullet, that it required a culture change and that people driving their private vehicles were not part of the solution  but part of the problem. So far, so unremarkable. Then he admitted the blindingly obvious – that even if there were a million buses on the roads, with great, practical routes and even if the service was free, people still wouldn’t use the service because buses would get caught up in traffic and be as slow and as unreliable as they are at present. And then he suggested reserved bus lanes with the aplomb of someone who has come up with a revolutionary idea. The only thing is that bus lanes or strategic bus corridors are hardly a new concept. They were introduced in the local plans a good 17 years ago. Quoting from one such local plan, which states: “the local plan introduces the concept of strategic bus corridors. “Along these corridors measures will be introduced to improve the speed, reliability and convenience of bus services, together with land use policies intended to promote greater bus usage”. Since then, not one single strategic bus corridor/bus lane has been put into place, with the result that buses are mired in traffic and commuters shun them. Instead, we get road-widening exercises which gobble up swathes of valuable agricultural land. But then the costs for road-widening works can be overinflated for obvious reasons. The introduction of reserved bus corridors – on the other hand – requires enforcement – something which the Maltese authorities refuse to do. So, we are doomed to an endless saga of roadworks, buses stuck in traffic and interviews with transport ministers bleating on about the need for a culture change – but not implementing practical measures to bring it about.

Title: Man faces rape charges seven years after teen files report
Body: A man has been remanded in custody after being charged with rape, seven years after the alleged victim, 17, filed a report. His lawyers claimed in court on Friday that the man only got to know he was wanted for rape two days ago.  The allegations were made by a Bulgarian national living in Malta, who had gone to the police in 2016, claiming to have been raped by a man she had met through mutual friends. Her report kicked off police investigations and a magisterial inquiry that was wrapped up in 2018. However, no criminal action was taken against the 37-year-old Kuwait-born suspect who has been living in Malta since 2008. The prosecution on Friday explained that the man proved difficult to track down since he was a private chef working aboard yachts and thus often travelled abroad on work-related trips.  Prosecuting Inspector Dorianne Tabone said she had recently taken over the case and reopened investigations. An arrest warrant was issued this week after police received fresh information that the suspect had arrived in Malta last month. Two days ago he was taken into custody and interrogated, at first failing to identify the alleged victim.  He subsequently recalled the woman but strongly denied having had sex with her.  On Friday the man was charged with violent rape, holding the alleged victim against her will and causing her slight injuries. He was also charged with possession of cocaine in circumstances denoting that the drug was not solely for his personal use as well as procurement of the drug.  He pleaded not guilty.  The alleged victim had told police that the man had given her cocaine, but his lawyers pointed out that no drugs were found in the accused’s possession.  The defence requested bail, arguing that all evidence had been preserved in the records of the magisterial inquiry and that there were no other civilian witnesses to testify.  The alleged victim’s report had been investigated by the Vice Squad but at no point had the accused been arrested or interrogated over the allegations.  Although the man had filed several police reports over unrelated issues over the past years, police had never arrested him in relation to the alleged rape.  It was only two days ago that the man was faced with an arrest warrant, his lawyers stressed.  Moreover, the accused had a validly renewed residence permit approved by Identity Malta after proper due diligence tests which also involved consultation with the police. And the victim had testified in the inquiry, meaning that her version was well-preserved, the defence argued further. However, the prosecution rebutted that the woman had not testified at the inquiry. Since she was still to testify and the accused knew where she lived, there was a risk of tampering with evidence, the court was told.  There was also the fear of absconding, given the accused’s ties abroad and the fact that in spite of various international requests, police had taken so long to track him down, the prosecution went on.  After hearing submissions by both parties and in light of the prosecution’s objections, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request and remanded the accused in custody  The court upheld requests for a ban on the names of both the alleged victim and the accused, in view of the nature of the charges. The court also upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the woman. AG lawyer Sean Azzopardi prosecuted, together with Inspector Dorianne Tabone. Lawyers Jacob Magri and Frank Anthony Tabone, together with legal procurator Mark Sultana were defence counsel. Lawyer Stephanie Caruana appeared parte civile.

Title: US shuts down major global ransomware group Hive
Body: The US Justice Department announced Thursday it had shut down the Hive ransomware operation, which had extorted more than $100 million from more than 1,500 victims worldwide. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that US authorities working with German and Netherlands law enforcement took over Hive's website and servers after having infiltrated it for nearly seven months. The infiltration helped hundreds of companies avoid paying $130 million in extortion demands made after Hive hacked and froze their data systems.   Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco called the operation to infiltrate Hive a "21st-century cyber stakeout."  "We hacked the hackers," she said. Hive operated as a ransomware service, meaning anyone could hire its software and other services to help hack into and lock down a target's IT systems, and to process payments. Hive and the client would share the profits from the extortion.  Since it first emerged in 2021 more than 1,500 companies and institutions have been hacked - their IT systems or databases encrypted by Hive and backup deleted or rendered inaccessible. The hackers would demand large payments, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for freeing up the systems. If victims refused to pay, Hive would publish confidential internal files and documents on the internet. Victims included India's Tata Power, German retail giant Media Markt, Costa Rica's public health service, Indonesia's state gas company and multiple US hospital groups, according to cybersecurity advisors. Early on Thursday, Hive's website on the dark web was frozen and a screen alternating in English and Russian said it had been taken over by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. US officials said that by breaking into Hive's dark-web site and collecting information, Justice authorities were able to obtain the digital keys necessary to unlock a victim's frozen data so that they were not forced to pay Hive. This helped prevent a Texas school district, and Louisiana hospital, and an unnamed foods services company from having to pay millions of dollars in ransom after being hit by a Hive attack, for example, they said. "For months, we helped victims defeat their attackers and deprived the Hive network of extortion profits," said Monaco. US authorities would not say who is behind Hive or whether any arrests would accompany the shutdown of the operation, saying the investigation is ongoing. The investigation involved the US FBI, the German Reutlingen Police Headquarters, the German Federal Criminal Police, the Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit, and Europol.

Title: Witnesses describe how farmer was shot in field near Paola
Body: Relatives of a farmer who a neighbour allegedly shot at his fields in Paola on New Year’s Eve, testified in court on Thursday about the sequence of events and how they had seen their neighbour holding a shotgun. Martin Delia, a 66-year old pensioner, is pleading not guilty to the attempted murder of Anthony Azzopardi. Azzopardi himself had testified at the previous sitting, recalling how the incident took place while he was fixing some wooden fencing that separated his land from Delia’s property.  Azzoprdi's sister, Rita Bonnici, testified how she had been with her husband in the fields, but went indoors when the phone rang. She suddenly heard her brother scream for help. Looking outside, she saw her sibling, face smeared with blood. He shouted: “Rita! Call an ambulance! Martin shot me!” She called the ambulance as well as the police, fearing her brother would bleed to death. Asked about relations with the neighbours, the witness said that arguments did crop up occasionally about one thing or another, such as when one’s dog jumped into the other’s fields. Her husband, Coronato Bonnici, also testified on Thursday. He said that he was repairing his rubble wall when he suddenly heard his brother-in-law’s screams and saw the accused and his son running towards their farmhouse. From his vantage point, overlooking the Delia fields, he could see a shotgun in Martin’s hands. He too recalled the victim’s blood-smeared face. Following these testimonies, the prosecution informed the court that there were no other civilians to testify in the proceedings. Magistrate Monica Vella upheld the defence’s fresh request for bail, strongly warning the accused not to approach the alleged victim in any manner. The court issued a Protection Order in favour of the victim. Meanwhile, the accused is to reside at another address and he had been barred from going anywhere near the site where the shooting took place. Nor can he approach the prosecution witnesses. Bail was granted against a deposit of €5,000, a personal guarantee of €20,000, once weekly signing of the bail book and a curfew. Finally the court declared that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment. The case continues. AG lawyers Kaylie Bonnett and Nathaniel Falzon prosecuted, together with inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Antonello Magri. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Matthew Xuereb, Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri and Daniel Attard are defence counsel. Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb are appearing parte civile.

Title: Spain shaken after deadly church attacks
Body: The southern Spanish city of Algeciras was reeling Thursday, a day after a machete-wielding assailant stormed into two churches killing a verger and badly injuring a priest.  Spanish prosecutors immediately opened a terror probe following the incident near the city's port on Wednesday evening.  The attacker was arrested at the scene, with a police source identifying him as a 25-year-old Moroccan man.    "Just after 7:00 pm (1800 GMT), a man entered the church of San Isidro in Algeciras, where, armed with a machete, he attacked the priest, leaving him seriously wounded," an interior ministry statement said.  "Subsequently, he entered the church of Nuestra Senora de La Palma in which, after causing damages, he attacked the verger."  The verger, Diego Valencia, "managed to get out of the church, but was caught by the attacker outside and sustained mortal injuries," it said, identifying the weapon he used as a machete.  The two churches are several hundred metres apart and located in an area very close to the port in this town of around 120,000 residents. The emergency services said the priest had sustained injuries to the neck. His parish identified him as 74-year-old Antonio Rodriguez and said he had been celebrating the Eucharist at San Isidro church when he was attacked, describing his condition as "serious but stable".  A police source told AFP the assailant was wearing a long robe and had "shouted something" as he carried out the attack.  Eyewitnesses at Nuestra Senora de La Palma told local media the attacker ran into the building at around 7.30pm and shouting, began throwing icons, crosses and candles to the floor. The mayor of Algeciras has declared a day of mourning and called residents to gather for a demonstration of condemnation at midday (1100 GMT) in front of the church where the verger died.  In the town, which hosts the main port for ferries and other vessels travelling between Spain and Morocco, residents reeled from shock.  Juan Jose Marina, the parish priest of Nuestra Senora de La Palma, told public radio the idea of such an attack was unimaginable "because our ties with the Islamic world in Algeciras are good and we've never had any sort of problem".  "It just defies all logic," agreed Dris Mohamed Amar, spokesman for the local Muslim community, who was speaking on the same radio programme, saying he hoped "it was an isolated case by a demented lunatic and not something premeditated".

Title: Families of Boeing MAX crash victims set to face company in US court
Body: Relatives of passengers who died in the twin Boeing 737 MAX crashes are scheduled to confront the airplane maker Thursday in a US court, some four years after the tragedies in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The proceeding in Fort Worth, Texas, long sought by the families and resisted by the aerospace giant, is expected to include Boeing's entry of either a guilty or not guilty plea in a US criminal settlement over the calamities that claimed 346 lives. The families have already chalked up some victories from US District Judge Reed O'Connor, who last week ordered a Boeing representative to appear at Thursday's arraignment after ruling in October that the Department of Justice's deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Boeing was negotiated in violation of the families' rights. But those were stepping stones to the families' ultimate ambition in the case: Undoing key elements of the DPA, which required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution for charges Boeing defrauded the government during the certification of the MAX. Boeing and its top executives deserve no such relief, argue attorneys for the families, who also plan to ask the court to establish an independent monitor because "the Justice Department cannot be trusted to monitor Boeing," they say in a brief. "This is a case that involved 346 people dying," attorney Paul Cassell told AFP. "Why you wouldn't want an independent set of eyes looking in and making sure the criminal conduct isn't still going on is beyond me." Boeing has avoided commenting on the case outside of legal briefs, but Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told CNBC on Wednesday that he felt "nothing but heartbreak" for the families and supported their right to a hearing. "With respect to the legal proceeding itself, that's not a subject that I'm qualified to talk about," Calhoun said. The families have criticised the agreement ever since it was announced in January 2021, waging a battle not only against Boeing, but a second 800-pound gorilla: the Department of Justice. In unveiling the agreement, DOJ said Boeing was being held accountable for "fraudulent and deceptive" conduct towards Federal Aviation Administration regulators during the MAX certification when the company omitted key facts about the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a flight handling system that badly malfunctioned in both crashes. The DOJ's case spotlighted the deceptions of two Boeing technical pilots, but absolved leadership, concluding Boeing's misconduct was neither "pervasive" nor "facilitated by senior management," according to the DPA. But the families have rejected the validity of the agreement, arguing in legal briefs that Boeing's immunization from prosecution should be stripped because the DOJ flouted the US Crime Victims' Rights Act, which required the government to confer with them prior to entering into the agreement. O'Connor, in an October 21 ruling, backed the families' essential argument, ruling that they qualified as "crime victims" and concluding that Boeing's deceptions cost the relatives their loved ones.  "In sum, but for Boeing's criminal conspiracy to defraud the FAA, 346 people would not have lost their lives in the crashes," O'Connor wrote. Adding to the families' momentum has been the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in September fined Boeing $200 million for misleading investors about the MAX.  The SEC case homed in on a November 2018 press release approved by then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg after the first deadly crash on Indonesia's Lion Air. He stated that the MAX was "as safe as any plane that has ever flown the skies," even though the company was urgently addressing the MCAS problem. The agency also penalized Muilenburg $1 million in a settlement with the ex-CEO that accused him of "materially misleading" statements. O'Connor has not ruled on potential remedies. Legal experts say courts typically show deference towards the DOJ on such agreements. "The judge could cancel the DPA but I think that is unlikely," said Columbia University Professor John Coffee, who has criticized Justice's Boeing settlement as emblematic of the government's tendency to go easy on big, powerful companies.  "Prosecutors and the Executive Branch are given great discretion by law in that area (the decision to prosecute)," Coffee told AFP in an email. Brandon Garrett, a professor at Duke University Law School, said courts should consider the public interest during reviews of DPAs, adding that US law "permits such review." But Garrett said courts have generally interpreted their role "very narrowly," while the DOJ has usually opposed such a review. "If this judge does reject the agreement, I could imagine the DOJ would appeal, citing their prosecutorial discretion to defer prosecution," Garrett said.

Title: Two 16-year-olds charged with breaking teen's leg in Valletta assault
Body: Updated 6.21pm with court decision to refuse bail. Two teenagers have been charged with assault in connection with a violent attack in Valletta that left a child with a broken leg. The 16-year-old boys, who cannot be named by court order, sat quietly in court as charges were read out against them on Wednesday afternoon. One of the teenagers is from Floriana and works at a supermarket. The other is from Valletta and declared that he is unemployed. They jointly stand accused of assault, causing a person grievous injuries, insults and threats. Both have also been charged separately with causing a person slight injuries.   Given that they are 16, they will be charged as minors, meaning they will face reduced punishment if found guilty. Prosecutors however say that aggravating factors in the crime would augment the accused's sentences, should they be convicted.   Both pleaded not guilty but their request for bail was turned down. Police announced that they had arrested the two on Tuesday evening. Speaking in court, Inspector Daryl Borg told the court that one of the accused was found at home, while the other was accompanied to the police station by his stepfather. The two had not been cooperative, fellow prosecutor Kevin Pulis told the court, and one swore at officers when police knocked on his door.  "No bloody way am I coming to the police station. You're not arresting me [Niġi l-għassa l-ostja, mhux se tarrestawni]," the teen initially told arresting officers.  Pulis went on to argue that the assault victims were terrorised and the 15-year-old boy with a broken leg would be missing six weeks of school during exam time.  Defence lawyer Franco Debono, who is representing one of the accused, questioned the validity of his client’s arrest. But those concerns were dismissed by the magistrate. Debono nevertheless asked the court to minute the fact that when his client was taken into custody, the arresting officer did not inform him why they were being arrested. That, Debono argued, went against Article 355 of the Criminal Code. Inspector Pulis responded by telling the court that police had handed the accused a search and arrest warrant that made reference to a “report of grievous injuries”. Charges against the two teenagers stem from an incident on Merchants Street on Saturday evening, in which a group of Scouts members was attacked. Prosecutors say the assault was unprovoked. “My son was thrown to the floor and kicked repeatedly in the head and ribs as were the others but luckily, three of them got off relatively unhurt,” the father of one of the victims told Times of Malta. Another of the victims, a 15-year-old boy, required surgery after suffering a broken leg in the assault. The attack prompted Prime Minister Robert Abela to call for stricter sentences when people are convicted of such crimes, saying he no longer felt safe to let his daughter roam Valletta. Other reports of similar attacks in the capital city have since emerged.  Wednesday’s arraignment got off to a complicated start, after proceedings were held up because there was no court official available to receive a copy of criminal charges against the two accused. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech expressed irritation at the state of affairs, saying proceedings should not be held up due to a lack of court resources. The magistrate also noted that too many people had crowded into the courtroom, prompting defence lawyer Debono to point out that his colleague Stefano Filletti, who is representing the victims in this case, had brought the victim’s families into the courtroom for no reason. Filletti hit back, telling the court “these people’s kids were attacked, and they felt they should be here.” The magistrate subsequently ordered that only one parent per party was to be allowed in the courtroom. When making submissions for bail, the defence noted other, similar cases in which minors had been granted bail and argued that there was no justification for locking up 16-year-olds in preventative custody.  Rather than jail time, the focus should be on restorative justice, he said noting that the accused had no criminal records.  Prosecutors objected, noting the gravity of the offence and saying the two could tamper with evidence or intimidate civilian witnesses if allowed out.  The magistrate said a bail decree would be delivered in chambers. She issued a protection order in favour of the victims, at the request of their lawyer Filletti.  As the day's court hearing wound to a close, the magistrate noted that existing criminal laws concerning minors require updating.  While 16-year-olds are allowed to get married, run for office and even vote in national elections, they are nevertheless considered as minors when it comes to criminality, she said.  Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb represented one of the accused, with the other represented by lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri. Stefano Filletti represented two of the victims as a parte civile lawyer. Giannella de Marco and Charles Mercieca appeared as lawyers for another victim. Inspectors Daryl Borg and Kevin Pulis prosecuted. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Title: Woman, 30, says gang of teens attacked her in Valletta
Body: A 30-year-old woman has said that she was punched, kicked and had her hair ripped out by a gang of teens in Valletta in December, echoing a similar incident that left a 14-year-old boy with a broken leg on Saturday. Speaking to Times of Malta, Paula, who asked for her last name not to be published, said the incident occurred on the evening of December 18, when she and her partner were visiting a Christmas village. A disturbance, she claimed, was already underway while the couple was walking in front of the parliament building. Two adolescent girls, possibly in their late teens, were locked in a tussle and their altercation had sent an elderly woman who was walking in their vicinity tumbling to the floor. As her partner went to assist the woman on the floor, Paula stepped in to try and stop the two girls from continuing to fight. “I have to say, hundreds of people were walking by and no one was taking any action, no one calling the police, everybody was just watching and taking videos,” Paula said. “I thought it was just a fight between two girls over a boy or something. It got very violent but I couldn’t pull them apart,” she added. “In that moment, the gang around them went crazy and started attacking me, punching and kicking me, pulling my hair, pressing their feet on my ribs. At a point, I fell on the floor and they kept grabbing my hair. I lost so much hair that evening.” When her partner stepped in to try and stop the assault, the same gang turned their attention to him. “He came in between us and covered me and started to scream ‘enough enough’ but they continued to punch him,” Paula said. “Finally, the people who were just watching from the sidelines formed a ‘wall’ around me so they could not reach me. All of this was happening in the middle of the street.” Paula said that, following this, she did contact the police but was disappointed with their response, claiming that they discouraged her from filing a police report. “About four police officers arrived after a few minutes and what happened after is just laughable; it made me understand how little and insignificant we are in front of the authorities,” she said. “They asked me if I wanted to press charges and when I asked what the risk was to me they told me that I also run the risk of being charged as 'this is what happens in these cases’.” Paula claimed that the police who responded to her call refused to escort her to the health centre and reluctantly agreed to escort them to their waiting cab. “They just told me to avoid going to Valletta for a week and things would go back to normal. I was shocked then to read the news this week and recognise such a similar incident,”  she said. “I am lucky that I am a strong person and, after a week, I got over the trauma. “But for a week I was in complete shock and pain. I started to feel the bruises the day after... luckily for me they did not break my nose.” The woman spoke out following reports that a gang of teens assaulted another group of youngsters in the capital city this week. The attack, which bystanders said was unprovoked, left one teen with a broken leg.  Police have arrested two 16-year-olds in connection with that incident, which Prime Minister Robert Abela admitted had left him feeling that Valletta's streets were not safe for children. The two teen suspects are expected to be arraigned on Wednesday. Meanwhile, on social media, others have also said that they were attacked by a gang of youths in Valletta this week, with one woman claiming that her husband was beaten up by a gang of teenagers on Monday evening. Questions sent to the police were not answered at the time of writing. Speaking to Times of Malta, Valletta councillor Mark Spiteri Lucas said that while last Saturday’s incident had gained widespread attention, reports of gangs of teenagers terrorising residents and being a nuisance have not been uncommon over the past few years. “I’ve received various reports over the years from residents that groups of teenagers are acting like bullies or are trying to goad people into fights,” Spiteri Lucas said. “While I respect and admire the work that the police put into our locality, if the resources are not allocated for them to be able to tackle these issues, then I don’t think we can solve the problem. “I think what happened on Saturday has captured the attention of the public because it went to a new extreme and it’s an ugly photograph of what our society has become,” Spiteri Lucas added. “I hope this serves as an eye-opener because if this issue is not addressed, we’re just waiting for a tragedy to occur.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: 'I admitted to a crime I never did', says man guilty of defrauding his own son
Body: A man who pleaded guilty to gambling away his son’s cancer funds says he only admitted to the crime to avoid prison. A magistrate said Ryan Debattista and his partner had “shamelessly” betrayed the trust of the people who had raised €35,000 for his son’s treatment. Debattista and Nicole Bezzina had exploited the generosity of altruistic people and friends to bankroll their gambling addiction, losing all the money in the process, said Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech. But in comments hours after the judgment, Debattista said that they had “never” gambled money donated to them - but had no way of proving it. “I had my back against a wall. So I admitted to a crime I never did, just so that I don't go to prison,” Debattista told Times of Malta. Debattista and Nicole Bezzina, 27, pleaded guilty to defrauding their own son as well as other people who donated money for his cancer treatment, as well as to money laundering. The couple had welcomed the generosity of individuals, companies and even Malta’s professional football community, who all donated money to help the family out as their young son got cancer treatment overseas. A post on Debattista’s own Facebook page shows that the family was also gifted a family trip to Disneyland Paris by the local arm of a multinational firm.  But their high-profile case caught the eye of investigators at the Financial Crimes Investigation Department, who noted some major and incongruent spending by the unemployed couple. Times of Malta first revealed the investigation in 2021. The couple was charged last June. Following their guilty plea on Tuesday, they were fined €50,000 between themselves and had all their property confiscated.   Debattista spoke to Times of Malta on Tuesday, hours after the court verdict, saying he and his partner were “hurt” by people calling them bad parents. “We spent the money solely on our son. We even bought him a dog and a pony. Does this sound like we're parents who are robbing our son?” he argued. The 31-year-old admitted that he liked a punt and said he had once won €26,000 on long odds in a horse race. “I gambled some of that money,” he admitted. “But not our son's money. I would never do that.” Debattista said he did not receive a receipt for those winnings and that he therefore had no way of proving it. The court had not believed them when they presented various receipts showing how they had spent money during the time of their son's illness, he said.  Aside from having to pay the €50,000 fine, he and Bezzina will spend three years on probation and must undergo rehab to treat their gambling addiction. They have also been barred from going to betting parlours, horse racing events or placing bets online. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Title: Seven dead in new California shooting as police probe dance hall killings
Body: An Asian farm worker was in custody Monday after seven of his colleagues were killed in front of children at sites in California, days after a mass shooter killed 11 people at a Lunar New Year celebration near Los Angeles. The latest bloodshed to hit Asian Americans in California occurred at two farms around Half Moon Bay, a coastal community near San Francisco. San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus said seven people were killed and one injured in the twin shootings, and that a 67-year-old Half Moon Bay resident named Chunli Zhao had been taken into custody.   As the new tragedy unfolded, detectives at the southern end of the state were still probing what drove an elderly Asian immigrant to shoot dead 11 people gathered in celebration at a suburban dance hall - before taking his own life as police closed in. Both suspects used semiautomatic handguns in their assaults, and both appeared to have connections to at least some of their victims. Corpus said deputies had been dispatched to two nurseries around Half Moon Bay, a rural spot south of San Francisco, mid-afternoon Monday. Four people were dead at one of them and one critically wounded. "Shortly thereafter three additional victims were also located deceased with gunshot wounds at a separate shooting scene," she told reporters. "There's people that live at the location as well... it was in the afternoon when kids were out of school and for children to witnesses it is unspeakable," she said. Corpus said Zhou then drove to a sheriff's substation in Half Moon Bay where ABC7 crews captured dramatic footage of his arrest as he was pulled to the ground by armed officers. "Zhao was taken into custody without incident and a semi-automatic handgun was located in his vehicle," Corpus said. Reports said the dead are Chinese farmworkers, and that Zhao had worked at one of the farms. News of the fresh carnage came as detectives just a few hundred kilometres away in Monterey Park were trying to piece together why Huu Can Tran gunned down revellers gathered at a dance studio for Lunar New Year on Saturday night. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday that Tran, who had been arrested in 1994 for unlawful possession of a firearm, fired 42 rounds in the attack. But, he said, much was still unknown. "What drove a madman to do this? We don't know. But we intend to find out," he told reporters. Luna confirmed officers had been told Tran may have been known to some of his victims, but said there was currently no evidence he was related to any. News of a second mass shooting in California in less then 48 hours spread ripples of shock through the state, which already has some of the strictest firearm laws in the United States. An exasperated Governor Gavin Newsom, who had earlier Monday been in Monterey Park where he lashed out at federal inaction over guns, called it another "tragedy." "At the hospital meeting with victims of a mass shooting when I get pulled away to be briefed about another shooting. This time in Half Moon Bay. Tragedy upon tragedy," he tweeted. Saturday night's mass shooting was the worst in the United States since a teenage gunman in Uvalde, Texas killed 21 people at an elementary school last May. All but two were children. On Monday a picture began to emerge of the culprit in Monterey Park, a man who, according to his marriage license, had immigrated from China, and who had been a regular at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in the past. Tran's ex-wife told CNN the couple had met there two decades ago when he offered to give her informal lessons. The woman, who did not want to be named, said they married a short time later, but the relationship did not last, with the divorce finalized in 2006. She said Tran, who sometimes worked as a truck driver, was not violent, but could be impatient. A man who said he had previously known Tran said he would complain about dance teachers, who, he claimed, would say "evil things about him", CNN reported. He was "hostile to a lot of people there," the man told the broadcaster. Detectives who searched a mobile home where Tran had been living in Hemet, 85 miles (140 kilometres) east of Los Angeles, recovered a rifle, electronics and ammunition, Luna said. Police in the city said earlier this month Tran had made "fraud, theft, and poisoning allegations involving his family in the Los Angeles area 10 to 20 years ago." The family of 65-year-old My Nhan said the tragedy was "still sinking in." "She spent so many years going to the dance studio in Monterey Park on weekends," a statement said. "It's what she loved to do. But unfairly, Saturday was her last dance. Amid the grief, one tale of heroism has given hope as 26-year-old Brandon Tsay revealed how he grappled with Tran as the elderly man arrived at another dance studio, in what police believe was a planned second attack. "He was hitting me across the face, bashing me in the back of my head, I was trying to use my elbows to get the gun away from him," Tsay told ABC. "Finally, at one point I was able to pull the gun away from him, shove him aside, create some distance, point the gun at him, intimidate him, shouting, 'Get the hell out here. I'll shoot. Get away. Go.'" You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.
