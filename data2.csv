Luke Seguna this morning, alleging a severe infringement upon his right to a fair trial, reaching an irreversible point. It is asserted that during the initial moments of his arrest, individuals purportedly linked to the Curia gained access to the Parish Priest’s House in Marsaxlokk, where they either dispersed, destroyed, or tampered with crucial documentary evidence stored in Fr. Luke’s office.Following Fr. Luke’s release on bail during the initial proceedings, the Court additionally imposed a restriction forbidding the Priest from being present in the same locality. Furthermore, during the latest hearing, a court-appointed expert confirmed the disappearance of Fr. Luke’s laptop, which had been presented in court. Strangely, the laptop had already been examined by the police prior to its court presentation, without any judicial scrutiny.There is widespread agreement nationally that the presiding Magistrate plays a pivotal role in preventing such injustices.

Luke asserts that his right to a fair trial is further compromised as the police failed to inform the Duty Magistrate of their actions, constituting a flagrant violation of the law.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/fr-luke-seguna-claims-right-to-fair-trial-being-infringed/

First Time Buyers Were 21% Of 2022 Residential Property Buyers,,"According to the Foundation for Affordable Housing, 21% of 2022’s residential property purchases were first time buyers. This suggests that a significant portion of the population is actively entering the market, indicating strong demand for accommodation, reflecting the aspirations and challenges faced by those seeking residence, the foundation said. However, the Foundation emphasizes the need to continue working to increase access to homeownership in our country. This percentage, while indicating that many Maltese have enough assets to invest in more than one property, also shows the need for a strong rental market with unprecedented levels. Therefore, there will be an increase in properties available for rent, which are not typically targeted towards first-time buyers. This new reality, where rental properties are increasing to meet strong demand, will inevitably lead to a lower percentage of tenants buying for the first time when compared to the total number of property purchases. Until this new demand normalizes and the market stabilizes and adjusts to modern realities, it is critical to implement measures that increase accessibility and inclusivity in the property market, particularly for those looking to become homeowners for the first time. This situation highlights the importance of widespread and coordinated strategies to ensure that every segment of society can benefit from the available opportunities.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/first-time-buyers-were-21-of-2022-residential-property-buyers/

Increase in Cocaine Use in Malta Includes Religious Celebrations,,"In a recent European analysis, the Correlation – European Harm Reduction Network (C-EHRN) unveiled startling insights into drug user trends across Malta, pinpointing an alarming rise in cocaine usage that permeates even the most sacred aspects of social life.According to their New Drug Trends report, this increase is not confined to the fringes of society but is prevalent in settings as conventional as religious festivities, weddings, baptisms, and village feasts. The study, co-funded by the European Union, relies on data collected from focus groups throughout 2023, painting a vivid picture of a society where cocaine’s grip has intensified.The report goes beyond mere numbers, offering a glimpse into Malta’s drug landscape. It highlights not just the widespread use of cocaine in unexpected settings but also notes a noticeable uptick in the consumption of crack cocaine. This variant, known for its potency and high risk of addiction, has found its way into the hands of the most vulnerable, signalling a distressing shift in drug preference among at-risk groups.The report also noted that the availability of drugs seems to have increased Malta, with the island joining Balti, Copenhagen, Glasgow and Newport in the, at least, partial increase through the use of platforms such as social media.The C-EHRN’s findings reveal an increased engagement with other substances, such as ketamine and synthetic opioids. Alarmingly, the latter are often used unintentionally.This report underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy responses to address the evolving drug use trends within Malta’s communities.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/increase-in-cocaine-use-in-malta-includes-religious-celebrations/

The activists, at a symbolic protest in Għadira Bay, Mellieħa, accused Israel of conducting a “full-blown genocide” in Gaza, claiming over 33,000 Palestinians killed since October 7, displacement of almost all Gazans, and a blockade hindering essential aid. They highlighted Israel’s bombings of schools, churches, refugee camps, and hospitals, attributing it to a long-standing project to expel Palestinians. Despite Malta’s solidarity declarations, the activists criticized its failure to call for a permanent ceasefire within international institutions and reluctance to label Israeli actions as genocide.

Labor MEP Alex Agius Saliba expressed support for Malta joining the ICJ case. Activists also called for closing Malta’s airspace and sea to weapons of war and promoting pro-Palestinian stances at the EU and global levels.

This will help 00patients to have access to the best treatment, care and research.The Alliance strongly believes that with more widespread awareness and a coordinated effort, concrete results can be achieved for patients and their families. Mrs. Muscat spoke about the collaboration that exists with the Chinese authorities and the work that is being done to start contacts with large hospitals in China in order to establish relationships that can be of benefit to other Maltese patients.Mrs. Muscat said that the Alliance will continue to help as many patients with rare conditions as possible to have access to research which is often the only hope for them. During this year  Chinese medicinal therapy will continue to be given to patients who are members of the Alliance at the Mediterranean Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Kordin.Mrs. Muscat added that the Alliance will be focusing also on schools to convey information about these conditions and show the value of careers in medicine, science and research.

Ian Vassallo and Deputy Speaker David Agius.——The Deputy Speaker of Malta’s House of Representatives and MP David Agius inaugurated the National Campaign on Rare Diseases in Malta, organized by the National Alliance for Rare Diseases. The primary aim of this campaign is to raise awareness among the people of Malta and Gozo regarding the challenges faced by individuals affected by rare diseases in our country.Approximately 8,000 medical conditions are classified as rare diseases, and their unique nature makes it challenging for healthcare professionals to be well-versed in these health conditions. Rare diseases often manifest as chronic, progressive, and various types of uncommon cancers, leading to physical disabilities and premature deaths, especially at a young age. This poses a significant challenge for public health authorities in our country and globally, with an estimated 30 million individuals in Europe affected by rare diseases.In recent years, in collaboration with the National Alliance for Rare Diseases in Malta, Public Health Authorities have implemented crucial measures. These include neonatal screening, establishing a National Registry for Rare Diseases, enhancing the “Orphanet” informational website for use by doctors, patients, and their families, coordinating local medical care for patients with rare diseases, including specialized care in recognized medical centers abroad, and providing a social support framework for patients and their families.The Parliament of Malta consistently supports and collaborates with the National Alliance for Rare Diseases in its advocacy for those affected and their families. Recognizing the importance of national funding for medical and scientific research, the Parliament emphasizes the need to increase awareness about rare diseases and improve the effectiveness of treatments for patients. These programs require sustained support to yield the desired outcomes for everyone involved. The Deputy Speaker highlighted that caring for those with rare diseases reflects compassion towards fellow human beings.On this occasion, the Minister for Health and Active Ageing, Jo Etienne Abela MP, and the Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Mental Health, Ian Vassallo MP, also participated in the event.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/launch-of-the-2024-campaign-on-rare-diseases/

By planting a tree in the name of our new joiners, we aim not only to signify the beginning of their journey with us, but also to symbolise the professional growth and development we anticipate for both them and our organisation”.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/mga-plant-17-new-trees-for-new-employees-in-green-initiative/

48 Hour Extension For Suspect Arrest Of 12+ Year Imprisonment Crimes,,"Parliament has granted approval for two legislative measures concerning arrest and detention, as well as the restructuring of procedures related to the proceeds of crime.The legislation pertaining to arrest and detention enables the apprehension of individuals reasonably suspected of committing serious crimes carrying a penalty of 12 years imprisonment or more. The Magistrate is empowered to extend the detention by a maximum of 48 hours through an order. This law necessitated constitutional amendments.According to Minister Jonathan Attard, the law aims to provide the police with more effective tools in cases requiring prolonged detention of individuals suspected of serious crimes. The applicability of this law is emphasized to be an exception rather than a rule. Minister Attard highlighted its alignment with global efforts to address evolving complex crimes.Additionally, Parliament has endorsed an act amending various laws concerning the proceeds of crime. This bill seeks to establish a standardized procedure for attaching, freezing, and confiscating criminal proceeds while ensuring proportionality in line with the requests from Maltese and European Courts.The parliamentary process, particularly during the Committee stage, resulted in strengthening the bill to achieve a fair balance between the public interest in issuing such orders and the rights of the suspected, accused, or charged individuals to avoid financial ruin without a guilty verdict.These amendments do not lead to the dismissal of any crime or the mitigation of penalties. The existing procedure for crimes related to drugs, carrying a maximum life imprisonment sentence, remains unchanged.Key provisions include the obligation to identify properties and specific assets subject to Seizure and Freezing Orders, empowering the Court to modify such orders at the Defendant’s or Prosecutor’s request. The legislation introduces the possibility of increasing the amount released to the accused for sustenance during the case’s pendency. The Criminal Court, post-guilt determination, will decide on the value and assets for confiscation.Minister Jonathan Attard emphasized the commitment to creating a society where everyone is held accountable for their actions while ensuring that laws respect fundamental rights and require an objective justification for implemented measures. These legislations play a crucial role in advancing the efficiency of justice and the fight against crime.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/48-hour-extension-for-suspect-arrest-of-12-year-imprisonment-crimes/

The attire of the celebrants transformed into traditional Maltese garb.But we didn’t stop at tradition. Pushing the boundaries of creativity, we asked the AI to infuse elements of fantasy while keeping the Maltese festa spirit alive.The resulting images were a fantastical blend of folklore and imagination, intertwining mythical creatures and historical settings with the familiar festa vibrancy.

Marmarà’s report suggests that only 71% of eligible voters would participate in the election, a figure considerably lower than in previous elections. This decline in voter turnout could be a critical factor in the election’s outcome.The survey, conducted between January 20th and 26th, involved a sample of 1,000 individuals. The data was analysed using the Multiple Imputation Technique, a statistical method that allows for more accurate interpretations by addressing potential biases in survey responses.These findings offer a snapshot of the current political landscape in Malta, highlighting the Labour Party’s significant lead over its main rival. However, the lower anticipated voter turnout adds an element of unpredictability to the potential election outcome.",https://maltadaily.mt/labour-with-27000-vote-advantage-over-pn-torca-reports/

PN Raises Concerns Over Delays in Educational Support Services,,"The Nationalist Party has brought attention to a critical issue plaguing the education sector in the country, and the dire consequences it has on the future of students. According to the Shadow Minister for Education Justin Schembri, and the Shadow Minister for Equality, Civil Liberties, and Children’s Rights, Graziella Attard Previ, the revelation that 180 students are still waiting to be granted Learning Support Educators (LSE) underscores a troubling trend.The PN asserted that education is a fundamental right that every child should have access to, emphasising that the government’s shortcomings in this sector are becoming increasingly evident. During a news conference, the Shadow Ministers conveyed their determination to keep pressuring the government and providing an alternative to improve the situation.The data emerged from a Parliamentary Question to Clifton Grima, revealing that some students have been waiting for LSE support since October 2022, resulting in a 15-month wait for assistance during lessons in both Primary and Secondary schools. The Nationalist Party contends that this situation highlights a failure in the education system, as waiting lists for essential support services should not exist.The Nationalist Party criticised the government’s inaction, emphasising that the number of students waiting for LSE is continually growing. Across State, Private, and Church schools, there are over 5,000, 400, and 1,800 students, respectively, in need of additional forms of assistance.One of the root causes of the issue, as highlighted by the Nationalist Party, is the struggle to attract professionals to the education sector due to unfavorables working conditions. The wages do not adequately reflect the significant contributions of educators, making it challenging to find individuals willing to pursue or continue a career in education.In response to these challenges, the Nationalist Party is calling for the prioritisation of the education sector. They advocate for increased importance and priority to be given to teachers, educators, and workers, emphasising the need for improved working conditions and fair wages to attract and retain qualified individuals in the field.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/pn-raises-concerns-over-delays-in-educational-support-services/

Recovering Addict Baffled At Sedqa’s Support For Reform: Sedqa Official Response,,"A video uploaded to TikTok by Clinton Camilleri, known by his handle as ‘ClintonAddict’, expressed his disbelief as Sedqa’s support of the governmental proposed reform for more effective justice with drug victims. Clinton said that he could not believe what he was reading when Sedqa issued their agreement. He alleged that this could be why Sedqa does not have a good recovery rate. He went on to say that he would die for this cause as the loop holes offered by the new reform worry him immensely. Clinton said that no one with the right heart would support such a reform. MaltaDaily reached out to Sedqa for their response and a spokesperson said that Aġenzija Sedqa ‘stresses that when one carefully reads the statement issued, and goes beyond the title as interpreted by certain media, it can be seen that Sedqa is clear that the amounts proposed by the Government should in fact be reduced.’‘On the other hand, there are other proposals that can genuinely lead to those experiencing addiction problems getting all the help they need.’ ‘We note that the mentioned video of Mr. Clinton Camilleri gave a wrong interpretation of the message of the Agency and we remain committed to meet with him in order to better discuss our statement.

"Health Care System Almost In State Of Emergency, Says Adrian Delia",,"Patients at Mater Dei hospital are enduring undignified conditions due to a shortage of beds, warned Adrian Delia, the shadow minister for health in Malta. Speaking at a press conference, he claimed that there are persistent issues of long waiting lists and expressed concern that staff shortages and burnout could lead the country’s healthcare system into a critical emergency. Delia presented photos from Mater Dei, which show patients reportedly crowded into corridors and canteens. Insufficient beds force some patients to remain on stretchers until suitable beds become available.PN MP Stephen Spiteri highlighted the immense pressure on the emergency department, where some patients only see a doctor a day after admission, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment. Delia attributed the healthcare crisis to the government’s inadequate investment, linking it to the controversial Vitals and Steward deal. He showcased video footage of deteriorating infrastructure within Mater Dei, emphasizing a lack of planning and foresight in the healthcare sector. Delia argued that these issues create a healthcare divide, pushing those unable to wait for appointments towards private care. #MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/health-care-system-almost-in-state-of-emergency-says-adrian-delia/

Delays To Sandra Ramirez Case As Femicide Law Challenged,,"The commencement of evidence compilation against Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada, accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend in Sliema, Malta, has been postponed as the defence contests the new femicide law introduced in 2022. The law categorises the crime as an aggravated form of homicide, subjecting perpetrators to more severe penalties. Garcia Parada denies the femicide charge in connection with the death of Sandra Ramirez, who was found with stab wounds in January. His defense argues that the law is discriminatory and violates fundamental rights. The defense contends that denying the accused the ‘crime of passion’ defense in femicide cases is discriminatory, creating a disadvantage for those accused.This legal challenge mirrors another case where Roderick Cassar is also contesting the femicide law regarding the death of his estranged wife, Bernice. The femicide law broadens the scope by considering homicides as femicides if resulting from domestic violence, honor killings, misogynistic intentions, religious practices, or sexual abuse. The defense seeks a constitutional court referral to address the perceived human rights issue. The court has deferred the case until February 6 to allow the prosecution to respond to this unexpected request.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/delays-to-sandra-ramirez-case-as-femicide-law-challenged/

Dog Left For Dead In The Streets Is Healing Wonderfully,,"The Association for Abandoned Animals revealed that Bobby, a dog left for dead in the streets, has been treated and has his wounds healing wonderfully.

Because of the severe infection on his skin, it cannot be stitched right away, but hopefully soon’, said AAA. Another update from today revealed that the wound is starting to heal and is no longer infected. ‘Hopefully, very soon, it will be in a state good enough to close it surgically.’‘And from here, we thank the lovely Tamara, a vet nurse in Dr Trevor’s Clinic, who took Bobby to her home and is taking care of him and his medical needs, especially the non stop wound dressings.’‘We of AAA are taking care of his expenses, but all work is being done voluntary by her.We have no words, thank you and our respect.’#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/dog-left-for-dead-in-the-streets-is-healing-wonderfully/
Lidl And PAVI/PAMA Engage In Social Media War Over Prices,,"Malta is witnessing a supermarket rivalry between giants LIDL and PAVI/PAMA, captivating shoppers with a dispute over the cheaper can of Coca Cola. The feud began when PAVI/PAMA claimed their Coca Cola was €0.75 compared to LIDL’s €0.79. In response, LIDL posted a receipt showing PAVI charged €0.99, not €0.75, vowing to reduce their price to €0.69. This public spat is unusual in Malta, where direct price comparisons are infrequent. Such price wars are common in Europe and have grown amid consumer concerns over inflation.In the UK, advertising price wars contributed to reduced costs for various products. Rising living costs are a major concern in Malta, leading to a government initiative to cut the recommended retail price of 400 basic food items by at least 15%. LIDL and PAVI/PAMA are engaged in a competitive advertising battle, comparing prices of items like Kinder Bueno and ragú sauce. As both supermarket giants are part of the upcoming government scheme, it remains to be seen if this price war signals a new era in Maltese supermarket advertising as they vie for customer attention.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/lidl-and-pavi-pama-engage-in-social-media-war-over-prices/

The letter discusses not just the process of deciding which church, which priest to officiate and how to decide on decorations, but particularly dress code. ‘The dress code of the couple and all those participating in the ceremony should reflect the sanctity of the celebration’. The letter says that a dress conveys a message and should therefore not expose certain body parts too much – concerning not just a woman’s chest but also the shoulders. Dresses should not have transparent material for the areas highlighted in the letter, with the bishop saying that for those who already bought the dress, an accompanying scarf should be introduced. Photography and videography should also simply capture the moment, with extravagant posing offending the context of the wedding. ‘I understand this all may seem as unnecessary restriction.

Malta’s Drug Reform Debate: Clash of Perspectives and Public Consultation,,"Malta finds itself at the centre of a heated debate over proposed drug reforms, as Prime Minister Robert Abela defends the government’s efforts to modernise drug laws. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party voices strong opposition, highlighting concerns that the reforms may be granting leniency to drug traffickers.Justice Minister Jonathan Attard initiated a public consultation process, deeming the proposed reforms a “courageous step toward a fairer society.” The draft law, shaped through collaboration with stakeholders such as the judiciary, probation and parole boards, and healthcare institutions, seeks to strengthen existing legislation with a focus on human considerations and efficiency.Among the primary proposals are an increase in the composition of the Drug Offenders Rehabilitation Board, clearer criteria for converting a court into a drugs court, and the introduction of non-jury trials for serious drug offences. The reform also contemplates allowing prison inmates caught with drugs, while serving time, to qualify for rehabilitation rather than automatic re-imprisonment.However, the Nationalist Party strongly opposes the proposed changes, asserting that the government is categorising those caught with significant amounts of drugs as victims rather than traffickers. The party argues that the suggested limits—such as 500 ecstasy pills, 200 grams of heroin or cocaine, and 500 grams of cannabis—may inadvertently favour traffickers over victims.Prime Minister Abela defends the reform, emphasising that it aims to provide the courts with more options to handle cases appropriately. Abela criticises what he perceives as a misinformation campaign by the Nationalist Party, asserting that the penalty for drug trafficking remains life in prison, and a white paper has been published to engage the public in constructive discussions.The government contends that the reform offers flexibility to the courts, allowing them to consider circumstances such as rehabilitation when adjudicating cases involving possession of certain drugs. Abela acknowledges ongoing discussions with Caritas, an organisation deeply involved in assisting drug addiction victims, to ensure the reforms align with societal expectations.Photo Source: MART PRODUCTION#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/maltas-drug-reform-debate-clash-of-perspectives-and-public-consultation/

"Sexual Pleasure Is A Gift From God, Says Pope",,"In a Vatican address, Pope Francis proclaimed sexual pleasure as “a gift from God,” emphasizing the need for its disciplined enjoyment with patience. He cautioned against pornography, denouncing its provision of “satisfaction without relationship” and its potential to lead to addiction. The pontiff, addressing what he termed “the demon of lust,” delivered this sermon amid conservative Catholic criticism of Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, the new head of doctrine. Cardinal Fernández faced backlash for a decades-old book that explored human sexuality, featuring detailed descriptions of orgasms. The Pope’s recent sermon, however, was unrelated to these critiques.Pope Francis asserted that lust devastates relationships, citing the prevalence of toxic relationships in contemporary society. This discourse followed his previous address on the vice of gluttony. Meanwhile, Cardinal Fernández, in December, introduced guidelines approved by the Pope, permitting priests to bless same-sex couples, though he clarified it didn’t change the Church’s stance on homosexuality. The move elicited strong condemnation from conservative figures, including Cardinal Gerhard Müller, who labeled it a “sacrilegious and blasphemous act.” Tensions within the Catholic Church escalated, culminating in the Pope evicting outspoken critic Cardinal Raymond Burke and revoking his salary.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/sexual-pleasure-is-a-gift-from-god-says-pope/

Irish Times Tips Cardinal Mario Grech as Top European Pope Contender,,"According to an article published by The Irish Times on Sunday, January 14th, Gozitan Cardinal Mario Grech is emerging as a favoured European candidate for the papacy.Cardinal Mario Grech, a 66-year-old from Malta, is considered a prominent contender due to his pivotal role as the secretary general of the Synod of Bishops, actively contributing to the ongoing synodal process initiated by Pope Francis. His extensive experience includes serving on the Roman Rota and holding a bishopric position in Malta for over 18 years. The article highlights that Cardinal Grech’s origin from a small country could prove advantageous, especially in the realm of geopolitics. Currently, there are 241 cardinals, with only 136 under 80 years old and eligible to vote.The Irish Times notes that despite Pope Francis turning 87 last month and facing some minor health challenges, his overall health remains robust. The article suggests that a resignation due to increasing incapacity is more plausible than the pope passing away in office. However, it speculates that any such move is unlikely to occur before the conclusion of the Synod of Bishops in Rome next October.#MaltaDailyPhoto Source: ARCHDIOCESE OF MALTA / The Irish Times",https://maltadaily.mt/irish-times-tips-cardinal-mario-grech-as-top-european-pope-contender/

The artist behind it posted a photo of a red homemade sign on a ‘ħajt tas-sejjieħ’ saying ‘no ħ*ra tal-klieb’ (no dog sh*t).

This necessitates employers compensating for the “lost” days of rest by adding them to their employees’ leave entitlement. The feasts of patron saint Paul (10th February), saints Peter and Paul (29th June), and Independence Day (21st September) will all fall on a Saturday, whereas Freedom Day (31st March) aligns with Easter Sunday, pushing Good Friday to the 29th of March. Similarly, Victory Day (8th September) and the Immaculate Conception (8th December) both fall on a Sunday.Maltese labor law dictates that if a national or public holiday occurs on a Saturday or Sunday, workers are entitled to an additional day of vacation leave, supplementing their annual leave entitlement for that particular year. In 2024, you’ll also get two more  extended weekends due to the Sette Giugno commemoration (7th June) and Republic Day (13th December), both falling on a Friday. New Year’s Day was the sole holiday falling on a Monday for this year. #MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/6-public-national-holidays-to-fall-on-weekends-in-2024/

40% of Maltese don’t want their children to date a Muslim or transgender person,,"In a recent Eurobarometer survey, a comprehensive study tracking public opinions on social and political issues, Malta’s picture of attitudes towards discrimination and interpersonal relationships.The survey, conducted twice a year across the European Union, sheds light on evolving perspectives within Maltese society, particularly regarding discrimination based on skin color, religion, and gender identity.According to the findings, a substantial 70% of respondents in Malta acknowledged the prevalence of discrimination based on skin color, marking a significant 11-percentage point increase since the last survey in 2019. This surge, alongside Cyprus, represents one of the highest spikes in the EU. Interestingly, France and the Netherlands topped the list with 78% of respondents perceiving discrimination based on skin color as widespread, while Latvia (22%) and Lithuania (25%) reported the lowest prevalence.The survey delved deep into personal relationships, revealing that over 40% of Maltese respondents expressed discomfort with the idea of their child dating a Muslim or transgender person.

While this marks a 14-percentage point increase since 2019, it only marginally surpasses the EU average by one percentage point.One striking revelation from the survey is Malta’s unique identification of ‘disability’ as the primary factor affecting job opportunities. A notable 65 % of respondents believed that disability could disadvantage a candidate when vying for a job, reflecting a significant 38-percentage point increase since 2019—the highest surge across the EU and 50 % above the European average.Moreover, Malta exhibited the second-highest proportion (57 %) of respondents who believed that skin color could negatively impact job prospects and the third-highest share (50 %) for those associating ethnicity with potential hiring biases. This signals a heightened awareness of multiple forms of discrimination within employment settings.The survey also highlighted the persistence of discriminatory factors, including skin color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and home address, all mentioned more frequently by respondents compared to the 2019 survey.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/40-of-maltese-dont-want-their-children-to-date-a-muslim-or-transgender-person/

Social Housing For 11 Families In Qrendi,,"This year, four social housing projects were inaugurated, providing decent and dignified housing for 64 families in Qrendi with an investment of €1.5 million.

"It’s Time To Remove The Parliament Barriers, Says Architect",,"Taking to LinkedIn, Chartered Engineering Fellow and Architect David Grima expressed his disdain for the remaining barriers in front of Maltese Parliament following protests which took place over 4 years ago.‘The building’, Grima writes, ‘was built on stilts to make it seem permeable to society. A lot of money was then spent to achieve this design’ by Renzo Piano. ‘The barriers are not only ugly and unpleasant to the eye but completely screw up the architectural concept that was envisioned.’Grima argued that it’s a pity that certain decisions undermined the effort to change the ‘hideous Valletta entrance before it’s big overhaul.’ He even argued in favour of altering the landscape to find a way to plant permanent trees and ‘remove those cheap wooden planters’. This is not the first time the barriers have drawn online criticism. Back in 2022, young PN MP Eve Borg Bonello had pledged to work to eventually have these barriers removed. Others have used them as a source of their protestWhat do you think? Is it time the barriers were removed?#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/its-time-to-remove-the-parliament-barriers-says-architect/

This move aligns with the global push for cleaner and quieter urban environments.The electrification of cleaning equipment not only improves sustainability but also enhances efficiency and effectiveness in maintaining cleanliness in public spaces.With 100% carbon neutrality, the electric cleaning equipment significantly reduces carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to Malta’s efforts in combatting climate change.The introduction of state-of-the-art electric machinery is expected to increase the frequency of street cleaning, with some areas being cleaned three or four times a week, ensuring a cleaner and healthier urban environment for residents and visitors.The inauguration of the electric cleaning equipment follows the launch of the national campaign “Keeping Clean Together,” emphasising collective responsibility for maintaining cleanliness in public spaces.Government officials, including the Minister for Tourism Clayton Bartolo and the Parliamentary Secretary for European Funds Chris Bonett, expressed their support for the investment, highlighting its positive impact on the quality of life for residents and visitors.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/malta-takes-a-green-leap-with-e7-million-investment-in-electric-cleaning-equipment/
Malta 1st EU Country That Could Have 16 Year Old Mayors,,"Malta has achieved a historic milestone by becoming the inaugural European Union member state to grant 16 and 17-year-olds the opportunity to assume roles as mayors and deputy mayors, following unanimous approval of a new bill by the parliament on Monday. Under this legislation, individuals below 18 years of age who secure the highest number of votes from the party with the majority can ascend to the positions of mayor or deputy mayor.Pending President George Vella’s signature, the law is poised to take effect in the coming days, potentially paving the way for the emergence of the first 16 and 17-year-old mayors in Malta by the upcoming local council elections in June. Local government minister Owen Bonnici lauded the development as “groundbreaking legislation”. Previously, although 16 and 17-year-olds were permitted to vote and participate in local council elections, they were ineligible for the roles of mayor or deputy mayor, even if they secured the highest or second-highest number of first-count votes. The Maltese Parliament has just unanimously approved a groundbreaking legislation allowing youths under 18 to serve as Mayors/Deputy Mayors. Once signed by the President, Malta will lead the way as the first EU country embracing this reform. pic.twitter.com/CoMQI0frCb— •Owen Bonnici (@OwenBonnici) December 18, 2023The new law not only addresses this restriction but also introduces amendments allowing underage mayors to sign legal documents on behalf of the local council and making both the mayor and executive secretary “jointly responsible” for legal representation, enabling them to sue or be sued on behalf of the council. This progressive measure was outlined in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto and the government’s ‘National Strategic Vision for Local Governments’ document from May. Despite sparking varied emotions, with some mayors expressing concerns about the lack of life experience among 16 and 17-year-olds, others believe that their enthusiasm could invigorate local councils.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/malta-1st-eu-country-that-could-have-16-year-old-mayors/

Maltese Pigeons Dislike Being Around Modern Buildings,,"A study published in Xjenza Online Volume 10 Issue 2 conducted the first investigation into the abundance and distribution of feral pigeons in Malta using the distance sampling technique, correlating findings with urban environmental characteristics. Spanning from May to August 2020, surveys covered five districts, revealing sparse but widespread distribution, indicating ubiquity in urban environments across Malta. Highest abundance was observed in towns around Valletta, aligning with previous studies suggesting the spread of the Valletta population. Distance sampling provided estimates of pigeon abundance in specific urban environments, showing a preference for local centres and public open spaces. Factors influencing feral pigeon occurrence included resource distribution (food, water, shelter). Interestingly, modern buildings negatively correlated with abundance. Surprisingly, old buildings did not show a significant relationship either. The study suggests that the feral pigeon’s affinity for public open spaces in towns, particularly parks, may be influenced by a calmer ambiance offering more feeding opportunities and less stress. #MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/maltese-pigeons-dislike-being-around-modern-buildings/

5 New Promise Of Sale Agreements To Safeguard Band Clubs,,"In a continued effort to preserve Malta’s rich cultural heritage, the Ministry for National Heritage, the Arts, and Local Government has entered into promise-of-sale agreements with the owners of five additional premises utilised by musical societies. This move comes as these societies face an imminent risk of eviction due to the legal complexities surrounding pre-1995 leases. With this latest development, the total number of band clubs receiving assistance has risen to 11.The primary objective of these promise-of-sale agreements is to facilitate the government’s acquisition of these properties, allowing them to serve as official premises for the band clubs under new fair rent terms to be paid to the government. These five properties will join a previously announced list of six premises, disclosed in March of this year.Minister for National Heritage, the Arts, and Local Government Owen Bonnici highlighted the importance of this ongoing initiative, particularly in light of the Maltese festa’s recent inscription as Intangible Heritage of Mankind by UNESCO.He emphasised that through these acquisitions, the government is ensuring just and fair treatment for both the property owners and the band clubs themselves. Upon acquisition, these properties will be incorporated into a portfolio managed by a dedicated section within Arts Council Malta, overseeing various band club premises.These efforts align with the goals outlined in the ACM Strategy for 2025, focusing on investing in and promoting diverse artistic and cultural expressions while preserving Malta’s rich traditions. Dr Bonnici stated, “We are committed to protecting band clubs due to their profound cultural and social importance. We aim to enhance their contribution to fostering a more creative and inclusive society.”Arts Council Executive Chairman Albert Marshall explained that one of the main goals of Arts Council Malta’s Strategy 2025 is to advocate for and provide for community-led opportunities to engage in arts and culture, and thanks to this initiative, the Council is instrumental in bringing about this ambitious and beneficial project for the protection of precious cultural practices.The government’s investment in the final acquisition of these five properties amounts to €10,397,000. This amount is combined with the sum of €5.8 million, representing the acquisition of the six buildings announced earlier in March of this year.The promise of sale agreements was formalised for the following properties:– St. Mary Band Club of Mosta– St. Peter in Chains Band Club of Birzebbuga– 12th May of Żebbuġ Malta– St. Andrew Society of Lija– St. Helen Band Club (Duke of Connaught’s Own) of BirkirkaraEarlier this year, agreements were successfully reached with the owners of the following properties: Maria Regina Band Club of Marsa; Stella Levantina Band Club of Attard; Circolo San Giuseppe Filarmonica Sagra Famiglia of Kalkara and; Anici Band Club of Qormi.In the case of two properties, Stella Maris (Sliema) and Antoine de Paule Band Club (Paola), the process is complete and finalised.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/5-new-promise-of-sale-agreements-to-safeguard-band-clubs/

Game-Changing Rental Law Legal Amendments Unveiled,,"In a news conference at the heart of the Parliament building, Minister Roderick Galdes revealed details about a revitalised rental sector, unveiling a series of legal amendments poised to elevate living standards and cultivate harmony between tenants and owners.Paving the way to a stable and simple rental process, Minister Galdes proudly declared, “Three years ago, we ushered in a new era with unprecedented reforms in the rental sector. Today, we stand united, presenting legal amendments that promise increased stability and a simplified process for all.”The Minister’s commitment to progress was evident as he emphasised the majority of owners who diligently comply with existing laws served as the driving force behind these amendments. His message resonated: “Our mission is to strengthen the foundation of the rental sector, fostering a thriving environment for both landlords and tenants.”In a bid to bring errant landlords in line, Minister Galdes announced a groundbreaking amendment restricting the number of occupants in a single dwelling. “To ensure the harmony of shared spaces, an owner will not be permitted to register more than 6 people in one place, aligning with the Subsidiary Legislation – Classes of Use in Development Planning,” asserted Minister Galdes.This move, he added, is a strategic step to address the outliers who have yet to fall in line with established regulations, without burdening the vast majority of responsible property owners.The amendments empower the Housing Authority to wield administrative penalties, with a cap set at €2,329 for breaches such as unregistered contracts. Minister Galdes clarified, “We aim for cooperation, not confrontation. However, for those who fail to align with the law promptly, the Housing Authority reserves the right to escalate matters to the Magistrates’ Court, with a potential fine of up to €10,000.”This arsenal of measures, he insisted, is not punitive but rather a catalyst for creating a harmonious rental landscape where both tenants and landlords thrive.Stepping into the limelight, Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa affirmed that the amendments build upon the professional standards introduced three years ago. “Today’s changes are a testament to our commitment to nurturing a positive relationship between tenants and owners. We are ensuring that the rental market continues to offer dignified living opportunities and stability for Maltese families,” Zerafa declared with optimism.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/game-changing-rental-law-legal-amendments-unveiled/

The Mosta Local Council acknowledged the significance of trees for the local bird population and affirmed their commitment to the well-being of these creatures. The post explained that the lights were not part of any ongoing Christmas decoration plan for the trees, reinforcing the council’s understanding of the trees’ importance for bird-related needs.The clarification came in response to social media posts expressing concern about the potential disruption caused by the temporary lighting. Notably, BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana was among those expressing disapproval of the decision to illuminate trees intended for the local bird population.To further address concerns and align with the community’s values, the Mosta Local Council underscored that the potted trees in Mosta’s Square would not be lit up throughout the Christmas season.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/mosta-potted-trees-will-not-be-lit-up-again/

Malta Widely Considered as Viable Luxury Second Home Location by Brits,,"According to luxury real estate consultancy firm JamesEdition, Malta has been ranked the seventh most affordable place for a luxury second home for Brits.Malta placed above the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Montenegro, with Ireland occupying the top spot. The publication priced a luxury waterfront three-bedroom property at €635,000 while the same property was costed at €520,000, a study by Proven Partners has revealed.The countries included in the survey were ranked as such based on Google searches related to second and holiday homes, with Malta being considered attractive due to short flight times and low air fares from the UK.Criteria included the average price of a tasting menu at a top-rated fine dining restaurant and the average price for premium car hire per day.Despite the positive placement for Malta, one cannot ignore the dissonance against the recent news that young adults on average wage cannot afford to secure a down payment on a property.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/malta-widely-considered-as-viable-luxury-second-home-location-by-brits/

Maybe there were times where they were taken for granted. But if we truly want our children to be given the best education, we need a strong and serious investment, not just into the building of schools but also in the persons who will give our kids the best future.’‘We have dedicated teachers, who invest their time and energy to offer the best classroom environment. Instead of discouraging them, let’s empower them, give them what was promised to them and incentivise them.’‘This is the only way that we can secure the future of our children and that more youth are attracted to the profession itself. We are still in time.’This comes ahead of a Monday strike called upon by unions after no deal was struck between them and the government. #MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/metsola-urges-for-teacher-empowerment-ahead-of-strikes/

Malta Not On Penis Size 2023 Study List,,"A study on the average size of men’s genitals by the World Population Review reveals that it is generally smaller and more consistent globally than popular culture often assumes. The average erect penis length is estimated to be between 12.9 cm (5.1 in) and 13.92 cm (5.5 in). While men may place undue importance on size concerning self-worth, it has no correlation with fertility, total births, or the number of sexual partners.Interestingly, research highlights the top and bottom countries in terms of average penis size, with Sudan, DR Congo, and Ecuador at the top, and Thailand, North Korea, and Cambodia at the bottom. For some reason however, no data was provided for Malta. We’ll let you make of that what you will… Contrary to myths linking height, hand size, or shoe size to penis length, studies show negligible correlations. Men tend to overstate their size but consistently underestimate it compared to the average.Women are found to be less concerned about penis size than men. They often value girth more than length, with studies revealing that a significant percentage of women are satisfied with their partner’s endowment. In one study, women selected an ideal penis size of 16.0 cm (6.3 in) in length and 12.2 cm (4.8 in) in girth for a long-term partner. Overall, these findings challenge societal assumptions and shed light on the diverse perceptions of genital size.

Inauguration Of The Notarial Registers Archive,,"The Notarial Registers Archive (NRA), with an investment of €5 million, of which over €4 million came from the 2014-2020 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), has been inaugurated. The project was officially inaugurated by the Minister for the National Heritage, the Arts and Local Government Owen Bonnici, the Minister for Justice Jonathan Attard and Parliamentary Secretary for European Funds Chris Bonett.The project commenced in 2016. Since 2021, the Notarial Archives Register has become part of the National Archives of Malta. In July 2023, the Notarial Archives Foundation took over its management and operation.Minister Owen Bonnici stated that this Archive is a unique source of information where facts about the history of Malta and the Mediterranean continue to be discovered. He continued that the repository holds over 2km of records that shed light on the legal, economic, social, and cultural history of the Maltese islands.“This project has seen the complete conservation of the entire work of 15 individual notaries, amounting to over 600 volumes. These included manuscripts that were heavily damaged during the Second World War,” explained Minister Bonnici.Minister Jonathan Attard stated that the opening of this Notarial Registers Archive marks another memorable day in the rich history of the notarial profession of our country. “A profession that not only gave us an identity of who our predecessors were and the history of each and every Maltese and Gozitan person, but also a profession through which we learned a lot about the history of our country,” stated Minister Attard.Minister Attard reiterated that such facilities pave the way for the Notarial Registers Archive to establish itself as an international benchmark for archival research, preservation and conservation of paper. It is also proof of the Government’s commitment both towards the Maltese Heritage and towards the need to safeguard the notarial legal history.Parliamentary Secretary Chris Bonett explained “Through this project we are not only preserving our past but have also given access to the present generation by preserving these valuable documents that offer centuries-old heritage of knowledge. This investment will not only stimulate academic curiosity but also pave the way for future cultural and historical discoveries.”Through this investment, the two palazzi at 24, St Christopher Street, and 217, St Paul Street were rehabilitated and transformed into a multidisciplinary centre for historical and scientific investigation. The palazzo at St Christopher Street houses the manuscript collection within a fully climate-controlled environment, the first of its kind for the Maltese islands. The palazzo at St Paul Street will be receiving the general public, visitors, and researchers in spaces such as the NRA Museum, the Reading Room, and the volunteers’ space, apart from its Conservation laboratory.The entire collection of notarial documents is undergoing a disinfestation process prior to its return to the Archive repository.The NRA Museum will showcase highlights of the collection in the form of rotating exhibitions. Items on display include Pietro Caxaro’s Kantilena, Domenico Vigliarolo’s 16th century portolan chart, and the George Cross document.

“Start Discussions To Ban Cigarette Sales For Youth In Malta”,,"The government is advocating discussions to prohibit the sale of cigarettes to individuals born after a specific date, marking the inception of a potentially smoke-free generation. This proposal is outlined in a public consultation document released by the Ministry of Social Policy and Children’s Rights on Monday. The suggested measure urges national-level deliberations to ban cigarette sales to individuals born after a collectively determined date, aiming to positively impact the health of forthcoming generations. Part of a comprehensive vision to enhance child well-being over the next six years, this proposal is one of 198 measures disclosed in a Children’s Policy Framework document presented at a conference. While lacking specific details, if enacted, this ban would initiate the elimination of tobacco smoking.Notably, the UK government recently implemented a similar measure, describing it as a groundbreaking law prohibiting cigarette sales to those born on or after January 1, 2009. Positioned as a significant public health intervention, the UK anticipates saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. This initiative follows New Zealand’s comparable anti-smoking legislation, aligning with broader goals to achieve a smoke-free status by 2025. However, the smoking prevalence among Maltese citizens remains high, as indicated by a 2021 EU-wide survey, revealing that Maltese smokers exhibit one of the highest daily smoking rates in the bloc. Despite these efforts, a local study found that a majority of children in Malta had detectable levels of second-hand smoke, contradicting parental reports of non-exposure at home.

The project, they cautioned on Tuesday, poses a severe threat to the integrity of the UNESCO World Heritage Site and its designated buffer zone.The Ġgantija Temples are a significant historical landmark in Malta, and the surrounding UNESCO-established buffer zone is crucial for preserving their cultural and environmental importance, as stated by Din L-Art Ħelwa Għawdex, Għawdix, and Wirt Għawdex.Asserting that sites of global importance are not for sale and should be protected for future generations, the NGOs criticized local developers, governmental authorities, and politicians, emphasizing the responsibility to shield such sites.They declared their intention to file a permit revocation request based on flaws in the approval procedure and the presence of errors and incorrect information leading to the permit’s issuance.Expressing satisfaction with recent strong statements from Heritage Malta and a ‘revised opinion’ from the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage, the NGOs called on the government and the Planning Authority to fulfill their duty to the nation and the civilized world by halting the environmental damage being inflicted upon the country.Times of Malta reported that the Superintendence plans to request the Planning Authority to freeze the contentious permit, and Heritage Malta announced its intention to strongly appeal the decision.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/ngos-ready-to-challenge-ggantija-construction-permit/
People Lashing Out At Unjust Speed Guns Across Malta,,"Locals have become concerned and lashed out at what they deem to be “unjust” speed guns, which have been snapshotting speeding vehicles and sending fines to whoever is found to be breaking the limit.A post uploaded to Facebook group ‘Is-Salott’ explains: ‘enough is enough. You receive 2 fines of €100 each and 8 points in the span of a month. Even if you’re going through a main road at 80 to 85, and not 120. Why does the fast lane exist then?’Many agreed with the status, exclaiming their own frustrations and detailing their own experiences with speed guns and fines. One critiqued the speed limit being unjust and too low, whereas another urged authorities to do something about drivers who drive at 25kms/h on a lane with a 60kms/h limit.Another alleged that they saw 8 police officers on one speed gun as if ‘they’re searching for criminals.’ One other commenter said punishing those over-speeding makes sense, but this situation does not make sense.Do you agree with these sentiments?#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/people-lashing-out-at-unjust-speed-guns-across-malta/

“Dogs are for life and family members. Do not abandon them.” Says AAA.,,"In the vast world of social media, stories that touch the heart and inspire change often emerge, and one such poignant tale comes from the Association for Abandoned Animals Malta (AAA). A recent post on their page unveiled the incredible journey of a canine survivor named Prince, a testament to the unwavering dedication of animal welfare organisations.The post began with a heartbreaking revelation – Prince, a defenceless dog, had been abandoned in the streets and endured the unimaginable trauma of being struck by a car. The accompanying photograph depicted the initial grim state in which Prince was found, a stark reminder of the harsh realities faced by countless animals left to fend for themselves.However, when Animal welfare stepped in, rescuing Prince from the streets and transporting him to the AAA sanctuary. The images that followed told a different story – a story of resilience, care, and gradual recovery. Prince, once a “bloody mess,” was depicted in subsequent photos almost unrecognisable as the same injured soul, now on the path to healing in the loving environment of the AAA sanctuary.The post did not merely narrate Prince’s physical transformation; it also shed light on the journey to uncover his history. Through the microchip embedded in Prince, the AAA team traced his ownership, revealing a distressing chain of events that led to his abandonment. Passing through multiple hands, the final person callously threw him out, leaving him to face the harsh realities of the streets alone.The post concluded on a positive note, expressing hope that animal welfare would take appropriate action against the heartless individual responsible for Prince’s plight. The uplifting finale showcased Prince in his current state – not only healed but embraced by a loving family.The underlying message resonates deeply: Dogs are not disposable commodities but cherished family members. Prince’s story serves as a powerful reminder of the responsibility that comes with pet ownership. The plea is clear – “Dogs are for life and family members. Do not abandon them.”#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/dogs-are-for-life-and-family-members-do-not-abandon-them-says-aaa/

Maltese Most Likely in EU to Get News From Social Media,,"A recent Eurobarometer survey has brought to light the evolving landscape of media consumption habits, revealing that people in Malta and Cyprus are most likely to get their news from social media platforms. Despite television being a predominant source of news for 71% of respondents across the European Union, an astonishing 70% of individuals in Malta and Cyprus disclosed that they access their news primarily through social media, marking the highest rate in the EU.The study, which examined recent media habits, positioned Hungary in second place with 56% of respondents relying on social media for their news updates. Following closely behind were Latvia, Greece, and Bulgaria, each recording a 55% dependence on social media as a primary source of news.The prevalence of social media as a news source is not limited to specific countries, as the survey found that 4 in 10 European Union citizens across the board actively follow influencers on various social media platforms. This trend underscores the increasing influence of online personalities in shaping public opinion and disseminating information.As social media continues to play an integral role in the way people consume news, the findings of the Eurobarometer survey signal a noteworthy shift in media preferences. The results prompt reflection on the changing dynamics of information dissemination and the impact of social media platforms on shaping public discourse across Europe.

"Young Adults Need At Least €25,000 in Annual Income to Secure a Loan in 2023",,"A recent study conducted by the Foundation for Affordable Housing has shed light on growing challenges for young adults in the realm of securing loans in 2023.The study indicates that individuals aged between 20 and 25 years now face increased eligibility criteria, with a requirement of an annual income of at least €25,000 to secure a loan. Moreover, if interest rates increase in line with international market developments, these young adults could find themselves needing over €30,000 to qualify for a loan.This shift in eligibility criteria not only affects the prospects of homeownership for the typical first-time buyer but also impacts renters and individuals who are separated or divorced. The study highlights that these demographics now require a higher income threshold to become eligible for a loan, further limiting their access to the housing market.The Foundation for Affordable Housing’s study also delves into the financial strains faced by many families, revealing that 13,000 households are spending over 30% of their income on home-related expenses. This alarming statistic emphasises the heavy financial responsibilities borne by these families, underlining the urgent need for solutions to address the affordability crisis.As the housing landscape evolves, policymakers, financial institutions, and advocacy groups are urged to collaborate in finding sustainable solutions. From reevaluating loan eligibility criteria to exploring initiatives that promote affordable housing options, addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure that young adults and struggling families are not excluded from the opportunity to secure a stable and affordable home.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/young-adults-need-at-least-e25000-in-annual-income-to-secure-a-loan-in-2023/

60% Of St Paul’s Bay Residents Are Foreign Nationals,,"The recently updated identity document data provides a comprehensive overview of the population distribution of both Maltese and foreign nationals across different localities, as of September 2023. This information, disclosed by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri in response to a parliamentary inquiry by PN MP Mark Anthony Sammut, excludes Maltese children under 14 who do not possess an ID card.As of September 2023, Malta had a population of 516,756 individuals holding identity documents, with approximately 71% (370,846 people) being Maltese nationals. The non-Maltese population is categorized into four groups: single permit residents (11.5%), European nationals (8.9%), non-EU nationals (5.9%), and British nationals with post-Brexit residency permits (1.9%).The data highlights population variations among localities. St Paul’s Bay remains the most populated, hosting over 36,000 residents, 60% of whom are foreign nationals. Birkirkara and Mosta are the localities with the highest concentration of Maltese residents.Furthermore, the data underscores the residential preferences of European nationals, predominantly settling in the northern harbor district, particularly Sliema, St Julian’s, Msida, and Swieqi.

Cocaine User Stabs Friend With Sword Thinking He’s The Devil,,"Josef Grech, a 33-year-old resident of Cospicua, was apprehended on Saturday morning after allegedly assaulting his friend with a sword. The victim, with a profusely bleeding right arm, sought help at the local police station.

It was revealed that both individuals had been consuming cocaine together when Grech, influenced by drug-induced paranoia, attacked his friend with a sword. Grech had been on a six to seven-day cocaine spree leading up to the violent incident.Following the assault, Grech was taken into police custody and later to Mater Dei Hospital. Initially unfit to provide a statement, he later chose to remain silent when declared fit. In court, dressed in a suit with anxious relatives behind him, Grech pleaded not guilty to charges of grievous bodily harm, assault, and threats against the victim. The defense, highlighting the influence of drug-induced paranoia on criminal intent, requested toxicological tests on Grech’s blood and potentially hair samples.Bail was contested by the prosecution, citing the severity of the offenses and the victim’s critical condition. Grech’s clean criminal record and the difficulty of approaching the victim due to hospitalization were presented by the defense.

Marzia Maatouk Makes Europol’s Most Wanted List,,"Europol has elevated Marzia Miramar Maatouk, the partner of notorious criminal Jomic Calleja, to its list of most wanted criminals. Both Calleja and Maatouk, convicted separately in August 2023, managed to avoid imprisonment by appealing their sentences under Maltese law, which allows the postponement of magistrates’ prison sentences pending appeal decisions. Consequently, Calleja Maatouk was released from police custody.Malta police suspect that the fugitive couple may have fled the country on a private boat to evade justice.

Agent Charged After 280 Foreign Workers Conned For Non-Existent Malta Job,,"A temporary employment agent from Balzan, faces charges for allegedly deceiving approximately 280 third-country nationals by enticing them to pay for job contracts in Malta that never materialised. The immigration police brought charges against Jonathan James Borg, accusing him of orchestrating a scheme that targeted mainly Indian foreign workers with promises of employment and accommodation in Malta.Upon arriving in Malta, the migrants discovered that their expectations were shattered. The scheme unraveled when individuals, who were promised jobs and housing by Borg, began contacting his employer to complain about unfulfilled commitments. Police investigations revealed that the third-country nationals had entered Malta using falsified travel and employment documents linked to Borg. Each migrant reportedly paid around €4,000, only to find themselves jobless and without accommodation.Borg pleaded not guilty to charges including human trafficking conspiracy, assisting foreign workers in violating immigration laws, unauthorised use of electronic data, tampering with data, software or documentation, and document fraud. Additionally, he faced charges of breaching an anti-money laundering attachment order, committing offences while under suspended sentences from 2019, and relapsing. Despite his plea, the court denied bail due to concerns about witness testimony and Borg’s previous violation of court orders.

6.5 Million Tallinja Passengers In October: Breaks Previous Record,,"In October 2023, Malta Public Transport achieved a significant milestone by carrying 6.5 million passengers by bus, surpassing the previous record of 6.1 million registered in August 2023. This increase in passenger numbers is attributed to the recent investment in 30 new fully electric buses to the company’s bus fleet.Since the launch of these 30 electric buses in September 2023, Malta Public Transport has been contracted to operate an additional 410 daily bus trips. This expansion has resulted in increased frequencies and enhanced capacity on 16 key routes connecting high-passenger-demand localities across Malta. All the new electric buses have zero pipe-tail emissions, which is expected to lead to an annual reduction of over 1,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to Malta’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint.The new electric buses are equipped with contemporary amenities, including accessibility features, air conditioning, USB chargers, and free Wi-Fi. These features not only enhance the passenger experience but also provide a quieter and smoother ride.Commenting on these developments, Konrad Pulè, General Manager of Malta Public Transport stated, “We are pleased to witness the positive impact our recent investments have had on our passenger numbers and the mobility in Malta. This is part of our commitment to continue improving our bus service for everyone’s benefit in Malta and Gozo.”#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/6-5-million-tallinja-passengers-in-october-breaks-previous-record/

PA Approval Of Apartments Near Ġgantija Sparks Outrage,,"The Planning Authority has granted approval for a 22-apartment block and 20 basement garages near Ġgantija Temples, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Xagħra, Gozo, despite UNESCO’s request for a heritage impact assessment. The decision, with seven votes in favor and one against from NGO representative Romano Cassar, occurred less than 200 meters from the temples. Cassar insisted on conducting the heritage impact assessment before making a decision and emphasized the project’s landscape impact. The Planning Authority argued that neither the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage nor the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Technical Committee objected to the building’s volume and massing.The development, located 157 meters from the temples, has faced objections from hundreds, citing potential impacts on Ġgantija’s World Heritage status.Moviment Graffitti shared the news, highlighting that the PA ‘ignored the request by UNESCO to carry out an evaluation of the impact on the historical site before a decision is taken.’ ‘It is absurd and totally unacceptable that we have arrived at a point where even prehistoric temples of our country are under threat from this unhinged infrastructural development’, wrote the activist group.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/pa-approval-of-apartments-near-ggantija-sparks-outrage/
Student Pilots Start Petition To Combat Flight Training Restrictions,,"In a letter and petition addressed to aviation authorities, student pilots from diverse local flight schools have outlined the challenges impeding their professional training. Urging immediate attention, they emphasize the critical need for effective communication and collaboration between authorities and the aviation training community to alleviate the pressing issues wreaking havoc on their education.The issues stem from two instances of restrictions, the first in January, where the Air Traffic Controllers Association ordered the cessation of intersection take-offs and touch-and-go exercises for code A aircraft. This mandate compelled students to backtrack the entire length of a 3.5-kilometer runway, resulting in significant delays, financial burdens, and environmental concerns due to prolonged engine run times.The denial of touch-and-go training further obstructed crucial phases of flight education, forcing students to either halt training or incur additional costs by flying to Comiso Airport in Sicily. Now facing a fresh emergency, the closure of the secondary runway 23/05 at Malta International Airport for maintenance has restricted flying to Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday, disrupting the students’ schedules.These limitations, exacerbated by stringent European Aviation Safety Association (EASA) regulations, incur additional expenses and weather-related cancellations during the limited operational days. Seeking clarification on compensations for extra block time, flight time, handling charges, and landing charges, the student pilots implore relevant authorities, including the Minister for Transport and Education, Malta Air Traffic Services, and Malta International Airport, to consider the profound impact on students and the training industry.Expressing gratitude for the support of their schools, the students anticipate collaborative efforts towards a resolution preserving the integrity of aviation training and upholding safety standards. A petition has been launched to address these issues, underscoring the urgency of the matter.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/student-pilots-start-petition-to-combat-flight-training-restrictions/

A Peak Of Newborn Hoglets: Caution Urged By Rescue Team,,"Wildlife Rescue Team Malta announced that the team is noting a peak of newborn hoglets. ‘These range from newborns to hoglets weighing less than 200g. Some are still with their eyes closed. We do our best to try and find the mother. However, in these cases, either the mum was not found or was found deceased.’‘Bottlefeeding hoglets is very time-consuming and takes a lot of patience, especially due to their tiny size, but also because they tend to curl into a ball whilst you’re trying to feed them. They also need stimulation to toilet.’The team emphasised that if one were to find a hog let, one should not touch the animal and instead immediately call for advice. The team uses a special formula due to hoglets being severely lactose intolerant, with normal milk possibly killing them. ‘Please think of us and our volunteers who need to wake up even during the night to give feeds every 2-3 hours. Any support is greatly appreciated’, the team asked. ‘If you spot any of the wild animals that we rescue injured or in danger, please call the Wildlife Rescue Team on 99999505.’#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/a-peak-of-newborn-hoglets-caution-urged-by-rescue-team/

Revealing Insights: The Profile of First-Time Buyers in Malta,,"In 2023, the Maltese Government introduced an initiative aimed at providing a financial boost to first-time buyers (FTBs) in Malta. This scheme offered FTBs a one-time grant of €10,000, distributed over ten years, effectively equating to €1,000 annually. The primary objective of this scheme was to alleviate the financial burden on FTBs, thus empowering them to realize their dream of homeownership. Furthermore, this initiative has enabled the Housing Authority to glean invaluable insights into the demographic profile and preferences of FTBs in Malta.Based on an extensive analysis of 3,103 applications, representing 4,590 individuals, successfully processed by the Housing Authority since the scheme’s inception, certain patterns and characteristics of FTBs have emerged. The majority of these applications, around 2,741, were submitted by FTBs who acquired their properties in 2022, while an additional 361 applicants completed their property purchases in 2023.A noteworthy finding of the analysis is that approximately 92% of the applications qualified for the full grant amount of €1,000, while the remaining 8% received a reduced grant of €500, often when only one person in a couple met the FTB criteria. The median age of FTBs in Malta hovers around 30 years, aligning with Eurostat figures indicating the average age at which young people in the country typically leave their parental homes.The report also revealed that slightly more than half of FTBs purchased their properties individually (single beneficiaries), accounting for 52% of all applications. In contrast, joint beneficiaries made up the remaining 48%. When breaking down the gender composition, males comprised 55% of single beneficiaries, with females constituting the remaining 45%.FTBs demonstrated a diverse range of property preferences, with purchases spanning 66 different localities across Malta and Gozo. The top five preferred localities for FTBs in Malta were St. Paul’s Bay, Zurrieq, Birkirkara, Mosta, and Zabbar. While St. Paul’s Bay continued to be a hotspot for FTBs, it’s interesting to note that FTBs often gravitated toward slightly different localities than those commonly sought for rental purposes.Approximately 7% of FTB property acquisitions were in Gozo, with Xaghra, Nadur, and Sannat emerging as the most sought-after localities on the island.The data also revealed that FTBs often favored properties close to their current addresses, with 48% choosing to buy in the same locality as their previous residence. This preference was less pronounced among single beneficiaries, with 43% purchasing in their hometown, often their parents’ residence. Gozitan FTBs exhibited a particularly strong preference for staying on the island, with 72% choosing to purchase within Gozo.Apartments were the most popular property type among FTBs, with 79% of single beneficiaries and 65% of joint beneficiaries opting for this style of residence. Notably, property finishes remained consistent, with roughly 74% of FTBs purchasing finished properties.The analysis also revealed that nearly half of FTBs acquired properties within the €150,000 to €250,000 price range. Single beneficiaries, in particular, were more likely to purchase within this price bracket, while joint beneficiaries often purchased more expensive properties.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/revealing-insights-the-profile-of-first-time-buyers-in-malta/

Civil Protection To Carry Out Tsunami Simulation Exercise,,"On November 7, 2023, from 8 am to noon, Malta will host a tsunami response drill, aimed at evaluating local preparedness plans, enhancing readiness, and refining community-wide coordination. The Mediterranean Sea has witnessed several tsunamis in the past century, including significant events in 1908 (Messina), 1956 (Greece), 2003 (Algeria), and 2017 (Greece), underscoring the critical importance of being well-prepared for such occurrences.Dubbed NEAMWAVE23, this exercise falls under the auspices of IOC-UNESCO and will simulate a widespread Tsunami Threat scenario in the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, necessitating the activation of local response plans. Coordinated by the Civil Protection Department, with support from the Department of Geosciences at the University of Malta, NEAMWAVE23 will evaluate the effectiveness of the Tsunami Warning System in the Mediterranean region, identifying both strengths and weaknesses, particularly in communication protocols.The Italian regional Tsunami Service Provider will issue Tsunami WATCH messages following a simulated large earthquake in the Eastern Mediterranean. These messages will be relayed to emergency responders and stakeholders by the CPD using established protocols. Additionally, a small-scale exercise will involve the evacuation and safe transport of a group of schoolchildren, along with the activation of public warning systems.Building on the success of NEAMWAVE21 in March 2021 and the Tsunami Last Mile project in Marsaxlokk in November 2021, NEAMWAVE23 will also fulfill a requirement for the CoastWAVE initiative, led by the Department of Geosciences at the University of Malta. CoastWAVE aims to certify several Mediterranean communities, including Marsaxlokk, as Tsunami Ready.

Explosives Dumped In Grey/Green Bags Destroy 140 Tons Of Recyclable Waste,,"Explosives were found dumped in last week’s grey/green bag collection endangering the lives of WasteServ employees and leading to the disposal of 140 tonnes of recyclable waste.

New Business Schemes Announced During Budget 2024,,"In a recent news conference Minister for the Economy, European Funds, and Lands, Silvio Schembri, proudly proclaimed that the Maltese Government is one with a social heart and a powerful economic vision.Minister Schembri acknowledged the persisting global challenges, including the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Despite these external pressures, Malta’s economic growth forecast for 2024 is around 4%.One of the cornerstones of this economic vision is the focus on the digital economy. Malta has already earned recognition, ranking sixth in the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) report by the European Commission.The technology industry in Malta, excluding the gaming sector, has shown significant growth, expanding by 300% over the past decade.The budget outlines several initiatives designed to modernise the country further, with particular attention to nurturing start-ups. These start-ups, according to Minister Schembri, hold the key to fostering innovative projects and potentially birthing revolutionary companies.To support this ecosystem, Malta has introduced various schemes, including:Business Start: Offering grants of up to €10,000 for small start-ups in their initial phases.Startup Finance: Providing financial support of up to €400,000 for promising start-ups.Kick Start: Offering funding of up to €100,000 for start-ups rooted in technical and scientific research.Venture Capital Fund: A €10 million fund to support local entrepreneurs with innovative ideas or products.Seed Investment Scheme: Tax incentives for Maltese companies that invest in start-ups.In addition to these schemes, Malta is creating DiHubMT, a €7 million investment to establish a space for start-ups and scale-ups to access the tools and resources necessary for product development.Video game development and virtual financial assets are also areas of focus. Malta is home to a growing number of companies in these sectors, with plans to increase the industry’s contribution to the GDP to 1% by 2028.European funds play a pivotal role in supporting businesses in Malta, with allocations of €100 million aimed at fostering economic growth.Photo Source: Wendy Verbraeken, DOI.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/new-business-schemes-announced-during-budget-2024/

Contrasting Reactions to Malta’s Budget: PL vs. PN,,"The budget’s impact on different groups and the government’s priorities are subjects of ongoing political debate in Malta. Malta’s Budget speech, delivered by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, has sparked varied reactions from members of different political parties.The responses from MP Randolph De Battista of the Labour Party (PL) and MP Ivan J Bartolo of the Nationalist Party (PN) reveal key differences in their assessments of the budget. Let’s delve into the distinctive viewpoints of these two politicians on what they liked and what bothered them about the Budget.  Randolph De Battista (PL)In his response, Randolph De Battista focuses on the positive aspects of the budget and emphasises the social measures that aim to benefit various segments of the population. He acknowledges the importance of supporting lower-income individuals, pensioners, families with children (notably the highest children’s allowance in history), and those with children with disabilities. De Battista also appreciates the budget’s emphasis on encouraging elderly citizens to stay active, addressing concerns he previously raised in Parliament.De Battista is particularly pleased that Malta’s approach to the budget differs from some other European countries, like France and Germany, which are currently discussing austerity measures. He commends the Maltese government for not burdening the people, highlighting initiatives such as the €350 assistance with electricity and water bills. This, according to him, helps protect the middle class and prevents people from falling into poverty.Speaking to Malta Daily, the PL MP also mentioned that he would like to understand a little more about the help that will be given to people who buy e-kick scooter. Randolph De Battista said that he would like to see the two parties agree on transport and alternative means of transport, to solve transport issues once and for all.  Ivan J Bartolo (PN)On the other hand, Ivan J Bartolo from the Nationalist Party expresses reservations about certain aspects of the budget. He questions the government’s decision to impose taxes on the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), an issue that many in Malta have raised concerns about. Bartolo points out that the COLA is meant to help citizens cope with the rising cost of living, and taxing it may be counterproductive.Another concern raised by Bartolo is the budget’s mention of the police’s success in tackling criminal organisations. He finds it perplexing that the budget document doesn’t acknowledge certain unresolved issues, such as the controversy surrounding the Steward and Vitals deal in Castile, which the court deemed a crime. Bartolo’s unease with this omission suggests a need for more transparency and accountability in law enforcement.Speaking to Malta Daily, Ivan J. Bartolo said that there are also social measures in the Budget that no one can deny that make sense.  These contrasting reactions to Malta’s Budget illustrate the deep political divide on how the government’s financial plans are perceived.While Randolph De Battista (PL) commends the budget for its social focus and measures aimed at supporting various demographics, Ivan J Bartolo (PN) questions the taxation of COLA and calls for a more critical examination of the police’s effectiveness in addressing criminal activities.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/contrasting-reactions-to-maltas-budget-pl-vs-pn/

Activist Portrays Dolphin In Protest Outside Mediterraneo Park,,"Animal Liberation Malta and Moviment Graffitti jointly organized a symbolic demonstration in front of Mediterraneo Park on Saturday, October 28th, with the intention of shedding light on the suffering endured by animals held in captivity. One of the activists creatively portrayed a dolphin inside a small pool, symbolizing the severe space constraints that captive dolphins face. To put it in perspective, a pod of dolphins in their natural habitat can travel up to 100 kilometers in a single day.During the demo, an activist dressed in a wetsuit mimicking a trainer, prompted the “dolphin” to perform tricks like clapping or jumping in exchange for fish. This served to illustrate the conditional training methods these animals are subjected to, effectively transforming them into performing animals, similar to those found in circuses, albeit under the façade of a licensed zoo.‘The animals imprisoned in this building spend extended periods alone in confined spaces when they are not performing – sometimes for hours on end. Many of these animals are social by nature, adding on to the number of unnatural conditions they are subjected to.’Animal Liberation Malta and Moviment Graffitti emphasize that the first step in assisting these animals is for the public to refrain from supporting such shows.‘Purchasing a ticket effectively endorses these exploitative actions towards dolphins and the rest of the imprisoned animals. They further urge the authorities not to grant permits to Mediterraneo for the importation of new animals, including sea lions, dolphins, or any other creatures, even if they are captive-bred. Additionally, we want to remind the public that there are numerous ethical and educational alternatives to appreciating animals that do not involve visiting zoos.’#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/activist-portrays-dolphin-in-protest-outside-mediterraneo-park/

Fr. Marcellino Micallef Wins The ‘Active Ageing Award’,,"The President of Malta George Vella said that the elderly should be provided every space and opportunity to continue using their knowledge and abilities for their own good and for the good of the community. “We cannot lose this wisdom and experience. These are not something old or superfluous, but a necessity in every modern society. Everyone has a role to play in this process”, stated the President during the ‘Active Ageing Award’ event, which this year was won by Father Marcellino Micallef.The President said that age should not impede a person from continuing to get involved and play a civic role in the community.

He mentioned, among others, areas such as innovation, technology, and solidarity between generations.The Minister for Active Ageing Jo Etienne Abela thanked all the elderly for their great contribution throughout their lives.

Petition To Add Maltese Language To Duolingo,,"A petition has been started by Julia Muscat to add the Maltese language to Duolingo, a popular educational technology company which produces learning apps and provides language certification.The app offers courses on well over 40 languages, as well as music and mathematics. However, the Maltese language seems to be missing from the roster of potential languages one can learn. The petition, launched on change.org, is listed in Italian and asks the app to introduce the language so that it is made easier to be learned as well as preserve it from the risks of being lost to time. ‘Little by little, the Maltese language is disappearing. It is extremely difficult to learn Maltese outside the country. There are many people of Maltese origin abroad who wish to learn the language but do not have the right resources. Duolingo, one of the most popular language learning platforms with over 300 million users (source: Duolingo), could be an ideal solution if it offered a Maltese course’, the description reads. ‘We therefore ask Duolingo to consider adding the Maltese course to its platform to help keep this beautiful and unique language alive.

Pledge To Increase Investment In Gozo & Karin Grech Hospitals,,"In the wake of the recent court decision to annul the Vitals/Steward contract, Malta’s Finance Minister, Clyde Caruana, has made a significant announcement during the first budget speech since the court’s decision.The government is committing to bolster the investment in two crucial healthcare facilities, the Gozo General Hospital and the Karin Grech Hospital.The investment slated for the next year is set at €75 million.During this budget speech, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana did not delve into the details of the Vitals-Steward controversy, nor did he address the court’s findings. Instead, his focus was squarely on outlining the government’s vision for the future, with a significant emphasis on investing in and improving healthcare services.The opposition’s stance, led by the Nationalist Party, has been clear in demanding the return of the money paid to Vitals/Steward. This stance was reinforced during a recent protest in Valletta, where Opposition Leader Bernard Grech and former leader Adrian Delia, among others, reiterated their concerns about the funds involved in the Vitals-Steward contract. Their argument revolves around the notion of ‘money stolen from the people’ and its potential alternative uses, which, according to them, could have greatly benefitted the Maltese population.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/pledge-to-increase-investment-in-gozo-karin-grech-hospitals/

"Energy Will Continue To Be Subsidised, Minister Reveals",,"During the unveiling of Budget 2024, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana revealed that at the cost of another €350 million for Malta, energy will continue to be subsided. Energy subsidies when it comes to electricity and fuel will be granted, €320 million will be spent by the government, with the total amount climbing up to €350 million. The Minister highlighted how never in history has there been such a large boost on fuels. Every €5 out of €100 spent by the government will be used to subsidise energy. This makes it the most important measure, the Minister emphasised. A business in Malta is paying 20c a unit. Compared to Italy or Germany, a unit costs approximately 40c. If these subsidies are not issued, the government forecasts that it will wreck the finances of most businesses. Meanwhile, a middle income family in possession of 2 cars with a normal consumption of electricity and water will be saving €1,300 yearly on fuel and €700 on electricity. Minister Caruana also highlighted that there won’t be a tax cut on COLA increase, but the government will help through subsidies aforementioned. #MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/lower-energy-bills-fo2024-minister-promises/

After having released rehabilitated Massimo, Dolly and Andrea, the team picked up Shanti, Martha and Jojo, with another one named Sky rescued from Comino. Shanti, Martha and Jojo were found on their own with no sign of their mothers or their nests in various areas around Gozo. ‘Hoglets always do best when raised by their mothers, so we only intervene and take in hoglets when we can find no sign of mum or the nest nearby’, the team explained. ‘Hoglets can get separated from their mothers for a number of reasons; sometimes the hoglet is too curious and confident and wanders out of the nest only to get lost. Sometimes the mother sadly passes away or she abandons the hoglet as she senses that something is wrong. Sometimes, it is because the mother is struggling to find enough food and water to keep herself and her hoglets alive.’ ‘Hedgehogs are Lactose intolerant and should NEVER be given cows milk, we use special hedgehog formula to feed the hoglets that we rescue.’Meanwhile, Sky was found ‘in the middle of the path in daylight. Sky is still a very young hoglet who has likely gotten separated from it’s mother. It is much too young to survive in the wild on it’s own, when found it was very cold and hungry. Sky has been given special hedgehog milk and a hot water bottle and will be cared for by our volunteers until old enough to be released.’#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/more-hedgehogs-rescued-as-others-return-to-nature/

Where Does The Tax We Pay Go?,,"Have you ever paused to consider where your hard-earned tax money goes once it’s collected by the government?The allocation of these funds is a complex and often misunderstood process, but let’s take a tour through the various types of government expenditure to shed light on this crucial aspect of governance.1. Daily Expenses: The Backbone of Government Operations (47%)A substantial chunk of your tax goes towards the day-to-day functioning of the government. This includes paying the salaries of government workers, the upkeep of government buildings, and the costs associated with the administration of the government and its various ministries. It’s not surprising that these operational expenses form a significant portion, making up nearly half of the government’s overall expenditure.2. Long-Term Investments: Building for a Better Tomorrow (8%)Another portion of government spending is directed towards long-term investments. These investments are like seeds sown for the future. They include the construction of schools, roads, and hospitals, all of which enhance the quality of life for citizens and create opportunities for them to earn more money, subsequently contributing more tax revenue in the years to come. While this category accounts for just 8% of government expenditure, it plays a vital role in shaping the nation’s future.3. Help to Those in Need: A Social Safety Net (22%)Governments worldwide have a responsibility to provide support to individuals in need. This support comes in the form of social security, disability pensions, and similar programs. Approximately a quarter of government expenditure is allocated to these essential safety nets, ensuring that vulnerable members of society receive the assistance they require.4. Debt and Interest Payments: Meeting Financial Obligations (3%)When governments borrow funds, they incur interest payments on their debt. A small fraction, only 3%, of government spending is dedicated to servicing this debt and paying the associated interest.5. Subsidies: Boosting Industries and Products (12%)Subsidies are a means by which governments provide financial assistance to specific industries or products to stimulate growth or ensure their affordability. This category accounts for a significant portion, comprising 12% of government expenditure.6. Other Costs: Responding to Emergencies and Extending Aid (6%)Governments must also set aside funds to respond to emergencies, such as natural disasters, and to provide aid to other countries in times of need. These costs are relatively modest, making up just 6% of government expenditure.In an ideal scenario, a government strives for efficiency in its spending practices. The aim is to allocate more funds to long-term investments and support for those in need. It’s also crucial for a government to exercise prudence in managing daily expenses, ensuring that taxpayer money is used judiciously and not wasted.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/where-does-the-tax-we-pay-go/
"MP Randolph De Battista Advocates for Peace, Justice, and Inclusivity in Angola",,"Luanda, Angola recently played host to the 147th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), where politicians from across the globe gathered to deliberate on pivotal issues. Among those who took the stage during this prestigious event was Maltese MP Randolph De Battista, who addressed the assembly in a compelling speech.The IPU Assembly, held between October 23 and 27, focused its debates on the theme of “action by parliaments for peace, justice, and strong institutions.” This theme is in line with one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, emphasising the importance of people’s trust in institutions and their capacity to meet the needs of all individuals equitably and sustainably.In his address during the Young Parliamentarians segment in the general debate, MP De Battista emphasised a fundamental aspect of leadership: that leaders exist to serve all people. For trust to be fostered in our institutions, people must feel a sense of belonging. MP De Battista pointed to an event that took place last month in the Maltese Parliament, where LGBTIQ+ parliamentarians from various corners of the world came together to discuss the importance of a more equal and just representation.Moreover, MP De Battista echoed a call made by Mr. Jerry Buttimer, President of the Irish Senate, for the IPU to intensify its efforts in promoting and defending the rights of LGBTIQ+ parliamentarians. As part of Intersex Awareness Day, MP De Battista also commended Dimakatso and Sharon Rose, two intersex youths from South Africa. These remarkable individuals shared their experiences through a new film titled “WHO I AM NOT,” contributing to the broader conversation on diversity and inclusion.The Maltese MP underlined the need for global peace by emphasizing the importance of reducing the prevalence of weapons and weapon financing in the world. Addressing the escalating tensions in the Middle East, he called for a stronger commitment to ensuring that both the people of Palestine and Israel can coexist without fear of violence and intimidation.In a heartfelt conclusion to his speech, MP De Battista made a compelling appeal for mutual respect. He acknowledged that achieving world peace may seem utopian in the current climate; nevertheless, he urged everyone to direct their efforts toward this noble goal. De Battista encouraged politicians to focus on fostering a spirit of cooperation rather than seeking to determine a victor. Such a stance, he argued, would ultimately lead to a world in which innocent people, humanity, and the world as a whole do not suffer the consequences of division and conflict.The Maltese parliamentary delegation to the 147th IPU Assembly, led by Speaker Anġlu Farrugia, also included MP Robert Cutajar. Together, they represented Malta on the global stage, advocating for the values of peace, justice, and inclusivity.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/mp-randolph-de-battista-advocates-for-peace-justice-and-inclusivity-in-angola/
“The Ability To Develop And Retain Our Charm” Before & After Photos Resurface Online,,"Preserving the Past and Building the Future!This architectural marvel of Karl Sammut Alessi is an extension over an existing three-story façade, carefully designed to seamlessly blend with the historic surroundings. Nestled within a bustling district of high-rise buildings, where extensions often disregard the original structures and Malta’s rich architectural heritage, this building extension stands out as a beacon of innovation and respect for the past.What sets this building apart is its deep reverence for the original structure. Instead of overpowering it, this extension gracefully integrates with the existing facade, adding a contemporary touch to the traditional architecture of Malta. The result is a breathtaking elevation that captivates the viewer and demonstrates that the marriage of past and present can be truly magnificent.One of the most notable features of this building is its intelligent use of traditional materials, elements, and motifs. It doesn’t merely replicate the past; it reinterprets it through a modern lens. This approach adds a unique character to the building, making it a testament to the island’s rich heritage and its commitment to a promising future.Located in the heart of Sliema, a thriving hub of development and activity, this building extension maintains a sense of respect for its surroundings. While the district boasts high-rise buildings and contemporary developments, this structure stands out by not relying on wide glazed voids that often mar the streetscape. Instead, it seeks to enhance the urban fabric while preserving the essence of the area.One of the most commendable aspects of this project is the restoration of the underlying facade. Rather than neglecting or overshadowing the original building, it has been lovingly restored, allowing the past and present to coexist harmoniously. This is in stark contrast to numerous other buildings where extensions have been carried out with little regard for the streetscape, contributing little to the overall aesthetics of the area.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/the-ability-to-develop-and-retain-our-charm-before-after-photos-resurface-online/
Malta To Increase Minimum Wage Annually for Four Years,,"In a move aimed at uplifting the lives of workers and fulfilling an electoral promise, the Maltese government has sealed an agreement to incrementally raise the minimum wage every year for the next four years.This significant development is in addition to the annual adjustments provided through the Cost of Living Allowance (COLA).The journey toward agreement began earlier this year when the government established the Low Wage Commission, which brought together representatives from both the government and social partners to collectively devise a strategy for increasing the National Minimum Wage.Starting from January 2024, the National Minimum Wage will experience a steady increase over the next four years. This increase is separate from the regular COLA adjustments.The current minimum wage, which stands at €192.73 per week.By January 2024, this rate will rise to €213.54 per week. In essence, anyone currently earning between €192.73 and €198.73 per week will witness an increase of €2 to €8 per week, in addition to the statutory COLA for 2024. Those with salaries exceeding €198.73 but not reaching €200.73 per week will receive the difference, coupled with the COLA applicable for 2024.For workers aged eighteen and above, the minimum wage progression in the coming years will look like this:2024: € 200.73 + COLA 20242025: € 203.73 + COLA 2024 and COLA 20252026: € 206.73 + COLA 2024, COLA 2025, and COLA 20262027: € 210.73 + COLA 2024, COLA 2025, COLA 2026, and COLA 2027This means that between 2024 and 2027, the National Minimum Wage will surge by €12 to €18 per week, in addition to the mandatory COLA increments.#MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/malta-to-increase-minimum-wage-annually-for-four-years/

MFOPD Study Sheds Light on Personal Assistance for Persons with Disabilities in Malta,,"The Maltese Federation of Organizations for Persons with Disabilities (MFOPD) has taken a significant step forward in its mission to advocate for the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities by publishing a comprehensive study on the state of Personal Assistance for Persons with Disabilities in Malta. This important study was made possible with the generous support of the Maltese Council for the Voluntary Sector and was conducted by Dr. Lara Bezzina, an experienced professional with over 18 years of expertise in the field of disability.The release of this study aligns perfectly with the ongoing efforts to reform the Personal Assistance scheme for Persons with Disabilities, a crucial initiative spearheaded by Aġenzija Sapport. This reform represents a key commitment outlined in the Government’s Electoral Manifesto and is presently open for public consultation. The proposed plan for reform includes active collaboration from various stakeholders, including individuals with disabilities, prominent professionals and experts in the field of disability, as well as local and international civil society organizations, such as the European Network on Independent Living (ENIL).Julia Farrugia Portelli, the Minister for Inclusion, Volunteering, and Consumer Rights, welcomed the publication of the study, emphasizing its vital role in the ongoing consultation process regarding the reform of Personal Assistance for Persons with Disabilities. She stated, “The publication of the study has come at an ideal point because it is part of the consultation process that the country is doing on the reform for Personal Assistance for Persons with Disabilities. Therefore, having research of this type is helpful so that when legislation is being drawn up it is based on facts and also on what the sector wants or is suggesting.”The study findings were also met with enthusiasm by Oliver Scicluna, CEO of Aġenzija Sapport. He expressed satisfaction with the study’s recommendations, which align with the ongoing efforts within the agency to reform the Personal Assistance scheme. This alignment is a testament to the collaborative and well-informed approach being taken to enhance the lives of persons with disabilities in Malta.Marthese Mugliette, President of MFOPD, emphasized the significance of Personal Assistance in the lives of people with disabilities, noting that it provides a crucial tool for enabling independence and full participation in the community.As the reform initiative advances, the Government has set a deadline for public input on the 30th of November. Members of the public are encouraged to share their suggestions by accessing the proposed reform document on the official consultation website at www.consultation.gov.mt. Suggestions can be submitted via an online form on the website, through email at pa.reform.sapport.sapport@gov.mt, or in writing to Aġenzija Sapport, Reforma Personal Assistant, Professional Development Center, Triq il-Harrub, Santa Venera.Photos: DOI#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/mfopd-study-sheds-light-on-personal-assistance-for-persons-with-disabilities-in-malta/

“Malta Needs To Diversify Its Housing Supply To Sustain Stability” – Housing Authority,,"“Malta needs to embrace different housing models that go beyond what we’ve done over the past 30 years and address the needs and desires of modern Maltese society.” – These were the words of Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa during a recent discussion on sustainability organised by EY Malta at the Future Realised Event 2023.The breakout session featured the Housing Authority alongside Project Green CEO Steve Ellul, BOV Head of BOV ESG Clint Flores, ERA CEO Kevin Mercieca, and Director at EY EMEIA Public Policy Ambrose Murray, who delved into the role of society in supporting a transition to a more sustainable Europe and Malta.While discussing the opportunities and progress made in the housing sector over recent years, it became evident that notable changes in demand and community demographics cannot be ignored. Zerafa highlighted how innovative pilot projects, such as the Intergenerational Housing initiative in Valletta, have successfully brought together a group of elderly and youths through a co-living concept that promotes open spaces and housing with multiple occupants within their own community.According to EY’s Malta Attractiveness Survey 2023, Malta is viewed as an appealing investment destination by 59% for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), marking a notable upswing from the decline registered during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the attractiveness of Malta’s ‘Social Climate Stability,’ within which housing plays a significant role, has seen a decrease of six percentage points compared to last year’s results. Factors such as ‘Cost Competitiveness’ and ‘Quality of Life’ are among the top risks to Malta’s FDI attractiveness. This concern is further emphasised by 86% of respondents who consider Malta’s planning and preparedness for population growth in terms of infrastructure development to be inadequate.Matthew Zerafa stated that by guaranteeing the stability in families, it translates into stable communities which guarantee a stable and sustainable economy.#MaltaDaily",https://maltadaily.mt/malta-needs-to-diversify-its-housing-supply-to-sustain-stability-ha/
Third Country Nationals will have to pass proficiency tests to work in Malta,,"In a significant step towards enhancing the quality of employment in Malta’s thriving hospitality and tourism industry, a groundbreaking initiative was unveiled at a press conference addressed by Ministers Byron Camilleri and Clayton Bartolo. The program, named the “Gateway to Quality Employment in the Hospitality and Tourism Industry,” is set to usher in a new era of professionalism and skill development for individuals seeking opportunities in this sector.The primary purpose is to ensure that individuals aspiring to work in Malta’s hospitality and tourism industry possess the necessary skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to provide top-quality service.The program’s implementation involves the collaborative efforts of three key entities: the Institute of Tourism Studies (ITS), the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA), and Identita’.Through its Training School, ITS provides and administers the training and assessments required for the program.

The fees are €450 for the online course and €125 for in-person assessments held in Malta. Upon successful completion of the program, ITS will issue official certificates to applicants who pass all mandatory assessments, which they can then upload along with other required documentation as requested by Identita’.The program is divided into two distinct stages. Stage One involves online training and assessments.

"Ronald McDonald House Charities Raises €27,000 For New Motor Sensory Room",,"Children attending the Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) Learning Centre in Qawra will soon have a motor sensory room thanks to a successful fundraising dinner where more than 200 guests were present.“Our research showed that the north part of Malta has no motor sensory room for therapists and parents to use outside school hours. That’s why we have set out to equip our Qawra property with specialist motor sensory equipment aimed at stimulating user’s motor skills and promote interaction in a calming and engaging environment,” said RMHC Chairman Martin Xuereb, adding that the new space would be inaugurated next year.The RMHC Learning Centre is a purpose-built 360-square meter facility filling a crucial gap in specialized and accessible support services for children facing challenges stemming from learning disabilities or social circumstances. It was inaugurated in 2019 and has since served hundreds of children, young people and their families, empowering NGOs and professionals to deliver their own programmes and services through counselling, therapy and training.To raise funds for the Motor Sensory Room, a dinner was held at Xara Lodge in Rabat, featuring a a silent auction showcasing stunning art pieces by local artists, including James Vella Clark, Francesca Balzan, Debbie Caruana Dingli, Nickie Sultana, Kane Cali, Celia Borg Cardona, Johanna Barthet and Pawl Carbonaro, as well as a weekend trip to Provence, courtesy of Hans Travel & Hans Jet.These efforts resulted in impressive proceeds of €27,000, bringing RMHC one step closer to fulfilling its charitable mission to continue enriching the lives of those in need.The Malta Chapter of RMHC is part of the Ronald McDonald House Charities global network network which delivers programmes and services in more than 60 countries and regions, benefitting the lives of millions of children and their families around the world.The event also included a raffle with an array of prizes supported by Allelon Hospitality, Dee Spas, Dota Frames, Enemed, Harvest Technology, Hilton Malta, iRiparo, iSpot, JPA, Land’s End Boutique Hotel, McDonald’s, M.

Mother Talks Her Transgender Son’s Journey & Transition,,"Sylvana, a mother of a transgender son, was invited onto a local television programme, AWLA, to discuss her experience as a mother of a child who is transitioning and the support the family received from the school.Sylvana explained how her child was born biologically female, but they started their social transition when they were in secondary school, with the help of school staff.Thankfully, the family found lots of support, with the school head and other staff understanding the situation – for example, the use of different pronouns and a new chosen name. The school even had a gender neutral bathroom, which, despite only being one bathroom in a three storey building, was immensely helpful for the child. Sylvana issued a message of understanding, saying that many students going through the same experience are not receiving the support that they need, with some facing discrimination simply for who they are. #MaltaDaily ",https://maltadaily.mt/mother-talks-her-transgender-sons-journey-transition/
