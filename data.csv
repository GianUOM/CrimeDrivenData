Man jailed for 34 years over Sta Luċija murder,Times of Malta,"A 41-year-old man was sentenced to 34 years imprisonment on Thursday after pleading guilty to the murder of Victor McKeon in a Sta  Luċija apartment four years ago. Samir Almiri, 34, a Libyan national who used to live with the victim, was extradited from Morocco to face trial and pleaded guilty after a plea bargain. McKeon, 62, was found lying on the bathroom floor covered head to toe in garbage bags. He had a deep laceration on his head probably caused by a sharp and pointed instrument and died from suffocation. His body was identified through DNA testing.   Lawyer Daniel Attard assisted the accused.    You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Decriminalise failure to pay alimony, parents rights lobby says",Daniel Ellul,"A parents rights lobby has called on the government to decriminalise failure to pay alimony payments.  Carrying placards stating 'parents are not just your ATM' and 'every child deserves to love both parents', around 20 members of Happy Parenting Malta protested outside parliament on Thursday They had earlier participated in a parliamentary conference about a wide range of social issues.  Anthony Cauchi, founder of the group, said jailing people over alimony does not benefit anyone and those who do not pay should be helped and not put in prison.    Another member of the group told Times of Malta how he was jailed for failing to pay alimony whilst in jail. Cauchi said the court is presiding over injustices as parents are sometimes forced to pay “financially breaking” maintenance payments and barely get to see their children following court judgements.  “Children have a right and need to have both parents play an active role in their lives. We need to introduce the idea of shared parenting into law,” he said. He said the psychological trauma of being alienated from their children has driven some parents to suicide and others to suffer severe psychological trauma.   Lawyers often “take advantage of families” and convince their clients to “take everything from their ex-partner” for their own financial benefit, Cauchi said.  Parents having access to their children only through supervised visits was also unjust, especially when there has been no court judgment on the parent, he said.  “Supervised visits are sending a message to children that their parent is bad or evil”,"" he said. On Monday, justice minister Jonathan Attard said his ministry was working on a legislative reform to tackle parental alienation.  He told parliament that a working group is at a “very advanced stage” and said that a public consultation document on reforms to the family court will soon be published.  “We don’t only want to strengthen the specialisation of the family court, but also to create new structures that can guarantee more effective and efficient justice which is in the best interest of minors,” he said.

Ħal Far race track upgrade gets PA’s green light,Matthew Xuereb,"An application to upgrade the existing drag racing strip in Ħal Far to bring it in line with international safety standards, making it ideal for international events, has been given the Planning Authority’s green light. Among other things, the project will see the extension of the track by 60 metres to allow more braking space as well as the introduction of several safety features including safety walls and a safety barrier between the track and spectators. The approved changes include the demolition and reconstruction of the spectator stands, tripling seating capacity to 3,000, with underlying ancillary facilities such as changing rooms, stores, sanitary facilities, and a shop. The existing control tower will be demolished and moved back by 60 metres to achieve the braking space. The tower will be reconstructed and will include stores, administration offices, two shops, club rooms, a multipurpose hall, VIP hospitality, and a commentary box. The new project will also see the construction of four garages and an extension of the safety barriers. The project's architect, Valerio Schembri, explained that the track is used for 16 events every year and its upgrade will place it on the international calendar. The changes were addressing safety issues flagged by German experts. The site has an approximate area of almost 70,000 square metres and currently consists of an existing drag racing strip operated by the Malta Motorsport Federation. It is located outside the development zone. A major part of the site is designated as a sports facility. Nicholas Barbara from the NGO Birdlife expressed surprise at the no objection given by the Environment and Resources Authority which said that there were no environmental concerns. The site is close to a Natura 2000 site so environmental screening was mandatory, he said. Ħal Far is the area that is affected by most light pollution, he said. Did anyone bother asking about the lighting scheme and the traffic impact of such a project, he asked.   Schembri replied that only one event is held under artificial lighting, towards the end of August. PA chairman Emanuel Camilleri proposed enhanced mitigation measures for light pollution as well as additional noise mitigation measures. NGO representative on the PA board, Romano Cassar, expressed doubts on how the 16 events a year would not increase if the racing track was being upgraded to be brought in line with international standards. He voted against the project while the rest of the board voted for. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Mqabba ODZ land to become warehouses, solar farm",Matthew Xuereb,"A large site in Mqabba, the size of two football grounds, will be turned into a complex of 28 warehouses after the Planning Authority gave its blessing to the project. Mqabba mayor Grace Marie Zerafa was the only board member to vote against, insisting that if quarries were to be allowed to become an industrial zone, then the locality will become another industrial area. Spearheaded by Carmel Mangion of Mangion Brothers, who have been involved in the quarrying business for more than four decades, the project will introduce industrial development in a quarry that was partly backfilled over the years with inert waste. The site, which measures approximately 12,500 square metres, is in an area known as Tas-Sejba and Tal-Modorbu, on the outskirts of Mqabba and Qrendi. The site is located around 180 metres from the development zone boundary of Mqabba and around 250 metres from the development zone boundary of Qrendi. The development includes constructing 28 industrial and warehousing units, with overlying PV panels, 117 parking spaces and landscaping within the disused quarry. It was recommended for approval. An outline development permit for the same proposal had already been granted by the Planning Authority in April 2022. The site is surrounded by other warehousing units as well as a large solar farm on an adjacent site. The Environment and Resources Authority objected to the project, reiterating the same position it had taken on the outline permit. It argued that the disused quarry ought to be backfilled and covered in soil so the site is restored to its original pristine state. According to the plans, a total of around 3,420 square metres of roof space overlying the warehouses will be allocated for a photovoltaic installation. The PV modules will be mounted at 10 degrees, having an elevated height at the highest point of circa 75cm. A total of 87 new olive trees will be planted according to the landscaping plan and an €8,700 bank guarantee will be imposed to ensure the implementation and maintenance of the landscaping scheme. Moreover, to compensate for the impact of the development, which is situated outside the development zone, the developer has been asked to make a financial planning contribution towards the Planning Fund of €130,000. During Thursday’s Planning Board meeting, PA chairman Emanuel Camilleri expressed concerns about the limited traffic circulation within the site, proposing a ring road with the site to allow for trucks to manoeuvre comfortably. He also suggested planting different trees to serve as a better visual buffer. The project’s architect, Ludovico Micallef, said that the works will be completed in about 15 months, which would include site clearance, construction and finishing works. He said that around 11,000 cubic metres of inert waste generated by the project will be used to fill the site. The project was approved with 11 votes in favour and one against.

"'We work and pay taxes': migrants to protest, demand social rights and residency",Sarah Carabott,"Migrants who have been living and working in Malta for several years will hold a protest on Sunday calling for policy changes that would grant them and their children born in Malta residency, social rights and stability. ""Although we were neither given protection nor a residence card, we were given the right to work legitimately and in turn to pay tax and national insurance for decades,” they said on Thursday, backed by several activists. ""We have worked for years, side-by-side with our Maltese colleagues, made friends, set up family and had children in Malta. We are part of Malta’s economic success, we have filled labour gaps, and we have contributed to a welfare system that we can never be beneficiaries of.""  RELATED STORIES  The third-country nationals added: ""Our children know no other country, no other society but the Maltese one. They are, in fact, though not in law, Maltese.” They explained they lived in constant fear of having their documents withdrawn, leaving them vulnerable to deportation, exploitation and unpredictability about their future. The march is being held after Times of Malta published the story of Kusi Dismark, a man who has been detained to be deported after 13 years in Malta. As a person who has been denied asylum, Kusi was allowed to work in Malta and pay his dues but had no access to free education. He financed his studies, opened a hair salon in Ħamrun and was planning on expanding his business until he was arrested on January 21. Kusi’s sudden detention sent shockwaves among his circle of friends, Maltese landlords and civil society. But he is not the only one in this situation. Malta has a right to return people who are rejected protection. However, not all are repatriated. Some countries of origin fail to provide official documentation for those handed a removal order or refuse to recognise the migrants’ claimed nationality. Additionally, Malta might not have diplomatic relations with their claimed country of origin. This means that people live years – even decades – in Malta with the threat of deportation hanging over their heads. Most people who are denied asylum are allowed to work in Malta and are obliged to pay tax and social contributions but have no access to free education. While working, they have access to healthcare but no social protection. This means that if they are injured, taken ill or can no longer be gainfully employed, they will not receive any social, medical or unemployment benefits. They are similarly not entitled to a pension once they reach retirement age. People with rejected asylum are not allowed to marry, even if they enter into loving relationships and form a family of their own. Children born in Malta to parents who have been rejected asylum inherit their parents’ lack of documentation, have no social protection and are technically stateless. The people organising Sunday’s protest, who identify as “long-term undocumented migrants in Malta” said they were not asking for any special treatment. “We are simply demanding stability: the recognition of years of hard work, integration efforts, and contribution to Maltese society. There is nothing fair or just in leaving us and our children in this state of uncertainty and fear. There is no equality without equity.” On Sunday, members of the migrant community and local organisations will be meeting at Ħamrun Square at 3pm and walk to the parliament building in Valletta. They are urging employers, neighbours, colleagues and friends who support the cause to join the march.  RELATED STORIES  The Church’s Migrants Commission director has separately called for immigration policies that are fair to hundreds of people who, through no fault of their own, have been allowed to live and work here for several years despite not being granted asylum. Fr Anton D’Amato said despite the removal of a person is legal, “it is definitely not just”.

"Grant citizenship to children born and brought up in Malta, parliament urged",Sarah Carabott,"Politicians were on Thursday urged to consider small legislative changes that would allow children born and brought up in Malta a right to citizenship. ""Stateless people are denied a legal identity, access to education, housing, healthcare, job opportunities and even a death certificate so that they can be buried. ""Statelessness is inherited from one generation to another, so a stateless person ends up existing but not living,"" senior lecturer at the University of Malta George Vital Zammit said.   ""There are children who were born in Malta, went to school in Malta, speak Maltese, lived all their life in Malta, are good in sports but cannot represent Malta as they have no citizenship... And then we advertise the selling of citizenship."" According to recent data, there are at least 171 stateless people in Malta, almost half of them aged under nine. Among others, children born in Malta to parents who have been rejected asylum inherit their parents’ lack of documentation, have no social protection and are technically stateless. Vital Zammit was speaking at a conference about social justice, organised by a team led by PN MP Ivan Bartolo. ""Is it time to revisit the absolute discretion of the minister [when it comes to granting citizenship]?... Parliament can - through small changes in the law and guidelines - allow people to live in dignity,"" he said, adding that ctizenship was a fundamental right. The conference, presided by Speaker Anġlu Farrugia, is a culmination of events that included the tabling of a private member's bill to shift to an ""opt-out"" organ donation system. The conference was addressed by several members of civil society facing issues of housing, the widening social gap, and homelessness among others. Ramona Vassallo, 52, spoke of the ""worst experience"" of her life when she ended up homeless two years ago. ""I'm suffering the consequences of my past drugs addiction,"" she said, adding that she was unable to work because of disability issues, so the little money she had was spent on food for herself and a homeless dog that was her only companion. She said that while she does not beg for money, she sometimes collects empty bottles from the trash to collect funds through the BCRS scheme and can afford food.   However, she is often made fun of while looking for bottles. Vassallo said that her police conduct and her pet made it extremely challenging to find shelter. As a female homeless person, she has suffered threats and was also beaten up on the streets: ""It's not safe for me outside, but when I tried to hide in abandoned buildings, I was fined €4,000 for squatting"". ""I do not wish for anyone - especially women - to end up homeless."" Several of those who addressed the conference spoke about judicial injustice. Anthony Cauchi, from the NGO Parental Alienation - Malta, noted that his association was holding a protest in Valletta on Thursday to raise awareness about the plight of parents who were denied access to their children. Cauchi called for urgent action that would no longer see alienated parents and children of couples who were separating having to turn up at court while the issue was resolved. ""Their place is not the court halls. They need a place that allows them to heal,"" he said. Cauchi also urged for access and alimony to be decriminalised: sending a parent to jail not only negatively impacted the parent, but also saw their children suffer stigma. Gżira mayor Konrad Borg Manché similarly noted that alimony and lack of access to children often broke people down. One of his clients, he said, was only allowed to see his children once every fortnight. Kenneth Grima, the father of Matteo Grima - a victim of a traffic accident - said his family had lost all trust in the authorities and the justice system. Matteo, who is now 22, was hit by a car in April 2020. The driver was cleared of the charges last year, since the two-year time window to face justice had elapsed. Sixty-four-year-old Raymond Camilleri was acquitted of all charges after Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace ruled that the charges were time-barred. ""It is shameful and unacceptable that a system meant to protect victims actually re-victimises victims."" Grima urged for amendments in the criminal code that would allow victims to Another parent - Isabelle Bonnici - who suffered ""the biggest loss a mother could suffer"" when her son Jean Paul Sofia was killed in a construction site, also addressed the event.   ""I was living a serene life planning what I'm going to cook for Jean Paul and what I'll get him for Christmas, when my life was suddenly turned upside down,"" she said, reminding those present that apart from her son losing his life, fellow workers were seriously injured and suffered disabilities. Wrapping up the event, PN leader Bernard Grech warned fellow politicians that social justice was not just a topic to discuss but a reality that people faced everyday. He flagged issues of lack of access to children, homeless people who don't qualify for housing, long waiting times at hospital suffered by patients before they are admitted to a ward and failure to trace people that are meant to be charged in court. Referring to Bonnici's persistence with politicians for justice, Grech said that politicians will be held accountable not for being present for Thursday's discussion in parliament, but for their behaviour in the coming months. Fellow MP and Social Solidarity Minister Michael Falzon commended Bartolo for organising the event. He noted that no minister could resolve all injustices. ""No one will solve all problems, but we can all make a big difference in someone's life,"" he said, quoting Mother Theresa. He assured participants he had taken note of their pleas, but reminded them of the separation of powers and that he could therefore not comment on judiciary delays.

Man accused of stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept ,Jessica Arena,"A 63-year-old man was remanded in custody on Thursday after denying stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept. Robert Frendo from Paola was arraigned in front of Magistrate Nadine Lia on Thursday charged with the attempted murder of his brother-in-law, Joseph Seychell, in the house where they both live. Inspector Keith Rizzo told the court he had responded to a request for assistance on February 20 in Triq Lampuka in Paola, where he found an ambulance on site and a doctor treating the alleged victim. Seychell told the inspector that Frendo had stabbed him multiple times in his sleep. Later, Rizzo said that Frendo was apprehended by the police and he spoke to him at the police station where he informed him of his rights. The accused was also charged with causing grievous injuries to Seychell and causing him to fear violence as well as carrying a weapon. When asked to confirm his identity to the court, Frendo paused before declaring that he was “guilty”, although he had not been asked to enter a plea. Before the standard questioning could continue, the proceedings were briefly suspended as Frendo was hauled away by his lawyer. Subsequently, after proceedings continued, lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar replied that the accused was choosing to plead not guilty and that the accused had previously “misunderstood the court”. Addressing members of the media present in the courtroom, Magistrate Lia told reporters that the case should not be “prejudicated” by Frendo’s earlier statement and that the official plea was the one registered after consultation with his lawyer. No request for bail was made. Police inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo as well as AG lawyers Nathaniel Falzon and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Adreana Zammit and Marion Camilleri appeared parte civile.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Eight bays had sewage leaks last year,Daniel Ellul,"Environmental authorities found sewage leaking into eight bays across Malta last year.   Manoel Island, Golden Bay, Birżebbuġa, Wied iż-Żurrieq and Mġarr ix-Xini all had one confirmed case of drainage leakage in 2023. Ta' Xbiex and Xemxija had two cases each.  Replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Rebekah Borg, Environment Minister Miriam Dalli said the Environment and Resources Authority had received 17 reports of leaked sewage.  ""There were 10 cases that visually showed they could be sewage, and therefore, the cases were referred to the Water Services Corporation as the entity responsible for drainage infrastructure and the Health Department, which is the competent authority for monitoring seawater quality for swimming,"" Dalli said.  Manoel Island. Photo: Matthew Mirabelli        Health authorities also flagged several bathing spots that were not reported to ERA for sewage spillage last year.  In September, bathers were urged to avoid St George's Bay in St Julian's and the Perched Beach in St Paul's Bay after health authorities detected EColi in the water. In August, EColi and I. Enterococci bacteria were also found in Ballutta Bay.  A report published last year by the European Environment Agency found that 94.3% of Malta's bathing waters were of ""excellent quality"".  The remaining 5.7% of the 87 Maltese bathing sites tested were deemed ""good quality"".  Malta's seawater quality, however, seems to be on a downward trend. The report covering 2021 found 96.6% of Maltese waters to be excellent. In 2020, that figure was at 97.7%. And 98.9% of Malta's seawater was excellent in a report for 2019.

EU Court rules against Malta on second-hand car taxation,Matthew Xuereb,"The European Court of Justice has ruled that Malta’s second-hand vehicle taxation system was in breach of EU law as cars purchased from other member states are taxed more heavily compared to domestic cars. In a ruling on Thursday, the court found that Malta’s taxation scheme for motor vehicles registered before January 1, 2009 was incompatible with an EU law provision that prohibits taxes favourable to domestic products over imports from other member states. Malta was taken to court in 2021 by the European Commission, which asked the court to rule on whether Malta failed in its obligations under EU law. In its decision, the court found that Malta’s vehicle taxation system for second-hand motor vehicles was favourable to motor vehicles that are registered domestically, over those registered in other member states before 2009. A provision of EU law prohibits national taxation systems that tax goods imported from other member states more than similar domestic products. This provision also prohibits the indirect favouring of domestic products over similar imported products. It found that the annual circulation tax for motor vehicles that are registered in other member states before January 2009 and subsequently imported into Malta is fixed at a higher rate than that applied to vehicles registered before that date in Malta. The rules had been put in place by the government in 2008 in a bid to protect local car import companies from far cheaper second-hand imports from the EU.   In 2019, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Malta, stating the national legislation laying down the framework for the annual circulation tax of second-hand motor vehicles was in breach of the EU provision. It followed this up with a formal court case filed in 2021. Malta argued that the tax framework was based on the “polluter pays” principle, favouring newer, smaller and cleaner vehicles. Malta further argued that the proposed reformed ACT system would have adverse consequences for vehicle owners of second-hand vehicles registered in Malta before 2009 in that these vehicles would be devalued and the owners would be subject to a higher tax. The Commission, on the other hand, emphasised that the relevant EU provision lays down an obligation on every member state not to impose unfavourable taxation systems on imported goods in favour of similar domestic goods. The Commission further contended that Malta should amend the national legislation to equalise the annual circulation tax rates for motor vehicles registered in another member state and those registered in Malta before the relevant date. In Thursday’s judgment, the court found Malta in failure of its obligations under EU law, affirming the purpose of the relevant EU provision in guaranteeing equality between internal taxation on national products and imported products, and the importance of this in EU competition law and the freedom of movement of goods. The Court ruled that Malta’s annual taxation system could not be considered compatible with EU law since it was aimed at excluding imported products by way of a bigger tax than that imposed on domestic goods.

Inflation stays at constant 3.7%,Times of Malta,"The annual rate of inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices in January remained at a constant rate of 3.7%, according to the National Statistics Office. The NSO said on Thursday that the highest annual inflation rates in January were recorded in food and non-alcoholic beverages (10.1%) and education (5.6%). On the other hand, the lowest annual inflation rates were registered in communication (-9.4%) and clothing and footwear (-0.8%). The largest upward impact on annual inflation in January was registered in the food and non-alcoholic beverages Index (+1.8 percentage points), largely due to higher vegetable prices. The second and third largest impacts were measured in the restaurants and hotels Index (+0.69 percentage points) and the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels Index (+0.44 percentage points), mainly on account of higher prices of restaurant services and rents, respectively. The downward impacts on annual inflation were registered in the communication Index (-0.38 percentage points), the clothing and footwear Index (-0.04 percentage points) and the recreation and culture Index (-0.03 percentage points), mainly reflecting lower prices of mobile phone services, footwear and package holidays, respectively (Chart 2).

Plans for new Paceville road junction 'extremely concerning' - Graffitti,Times of Malta,"Initial plans and renders for a new road junction in Paceville are extremely concerning as they reflect another car-centric project that will not alleviate traffic in the long term, civil society group Graffitti said. In a statement on Thursday, Moviment Graffitti called for Infrastructure Malta's plans for the junction, at the intersection between Swieqi and St Julian’s, to be sent back to the drawing board. ""This project, worth between €40 and €50 million in public funds, seems to be yet another car-centric project that will neither alleviate traffic in the long term, nor cater for the needs of anyone except car users,"" it said. It noted that the plans did not seem to include bus lanes and had very limited connections for pedestrians and cyclists. ""Given that four lanes of the project are dedicated almost exclusively to cars, space is clearly not the issue,"" Graffitti said. When Infrastructure Malta announced plans for the junction earlier in February, it said the new junction will facilitate access to St Julian's and Swieqi. In August last year, it had said it had plans for flyovers to replace the traffic lights at the junction. Graffitti noted on Thursday that only about 52% of Malta's total population has a Maltese driving licence. This meant that such a car-centric project only caters for about half the population. ""Our current transport model is not only incredibly inefficient, but also grossly unjust, prioritising cars over all other means of transport, and so the needs of some people over others. ""It is completely unacceptable that these plans seem to make no provisions for those reliant on public transport, and very little provisions for pedestrians and cyclists,"" Graffitti insisted. This infrastructure, it said, is partly intended to cater to the traffic demands of new developments in the area. These included Joseph Portelli’s Mercury Tower and the PX Lettings’ tower – both of which are in the immediate vicinity – as well as the DB project on the former ITS site and Garnet Investments Limited’s proposed mega-development on the Villa Rosa site. This meant that infrastructure that ultimately serves the profits of property speculators was being financed using public funds. ""The government should not be beholden to business interests and their traffic woes, and paying taxpayer's money to accommodate their profits is obscene. ""We urge the authorities to redesign the project by taking into consideration questions of justice and equity. ""The project in its current form does not look towards the future, but effectively towards the past, based on an outdated approach to traffic management and a car-centric vision that does not take public or active transport into account,"" it said. Graffitti asked why, after so many major road projects and traffic still at a stand-still, the government kept pursuing the same expensive, failed solutions. Major projects at Marsa, Kappara and elsewhere have only functioned to create more demand for cars or shifted bottlenecks elsewhere. ""An effective approach to traffic management requires a break with this strategy in favour of prioritising other means of transport, namely public transport, but also walking and cycling. ""We hope that any consultation taking place listens to people's concerns and suggestions and takes them seriously into account,"" Graffitti said.

‘I was jailed for not paying alimony… while in jail’,Matthew Xuereb,"A man sentenced to four months detention for not paying the excessive full amount of alimony while in jail for the same crime has complained that he had entered a vicious circle he will never get out of unless the courts were more understanding about particular circumstances. The man, who asked to be named only with his initials, MS, is appealing the jail term for failing to pay the full amount of alimony during a period when he was in jail after the court ruled that the fact he could not afford it was not acceptable as an excuse. The 54-year-old told Times of Malta he was a self-employed real estate agent focusing on letting and started facing financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic when the real estate sector suffered a major blow. MS said he had to sell his belongings, including his car, due to his financial constraints. He filed requests in court asking for a reduction in the amounts due in alimony but these were not accepted by the court, keeping the amount to €700 a month for both his children. He was jailed between September and December 2022 because he was not managing to pay the full amount to his estranged wife. While in jail, his ex-wife continued to file police reports about his lack of payment and, in February last year, he was charged with failing to pay alimony during the three months he spent at Corradino Correctional Facility. Earlier this month, Magistrate Lara Lanfranco sentenced him to four months in prison after finding him guilty of the offence. In her decision, the magistrate said “the accused’s failure to afford maintenance is not a valid excuse”. “The accused can secure gainful employment and, indeed, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so and, thus, his explanation cannot be considered as an impossibility to fulfil his obligation,” she ruled. MS explained that he had been married for 14 years and had two sons. Everything was fine for the first 18 months since his separation but then everything changed when his ex-wife changed her lawyer, making claims in court that he was “a monster” who was making their children suffer psychological abuse. “These were the first signs of parental alienation. I was paying regularly the €500 monthly maintenance as agreed on the separation contract but, then, she filed an application in court claiming that I was not paying my share of the extra curriculum expenses as well as medical expenses and education, asking the court to increase the amount of maintenance to €800. The court partially upheld the request, setting the alimony at €700 per month inclusive of all the extra expenses. I continued to pay but, then, COVID hit. I had to give up my car and I could barely afford basic necessities such as food. I was still working like a dog but letting contracts were simply not happening,” he said. MS said the court repeatedly refused his requests for a reduction in the alimony amount due to such a drastic change in circumstances, even ignoring the financial statements he presented to back up his claim. He said the family court even refused to allow him to appeal the decision, placing him in limbo and at imminent risk of imprisonment. In the meantime, he continued, his estranged wife reported him for seven months for failing to pay the full amount. In March 2022, the court sentenced him for seven months but, on appeal, the jail term was reduced to seven weeks, after the judge considered it to have been a continuous offence. “In October (2022), I was imprisoned and was released on Christmas Day with just €5.20 to my name. I started to apply for jobs through JobsPlus but I was not even called to one interview, so I went back to the real estate job. I was also doing odd jobs but I was not making enough money to pay the full amount and to make ends meet. I was paying €250 a month until I received another police summons to appear in court again. This is a never-ending vicious circle,” MS said. His lawyer, Conrad Borg Manché, said that a constitutional case had been filed since the increase in the amount of alimony was a “purely arbitrary decision” made by the court, constituting an unlawful order. It is also being claimed that his rights to a fair trial were infringed when his request for leave for appeal was turned down. In both cases, the decrees were void of any possible motivation or explanation, the lawyer said. The man is part of NGO Happy Parenting Malta, which is organising a protest in Valletta today to raise awareness and call for urgent amendments in the law and improvements to the family court procedures to address parental alienation. The NGO has proposed that there should be a special agency/board made up of experts in the subject and deal with the cases before the family goes to court. It is also proposing that access and alimony should be decriminalised. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Today's front pages - February 22, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the main stories in Thursday's newspapers. Times of Malta says a pan-European police investigation has concluded that a Maltese financial institution laundered at least €4.5 million in proceeds from criminal activities since the end of 2015.

"No Helena, no Evarist: PN rules out Muscat ministers for President",Mark Laurence Zammit,"The opposition would block any politician who sat in Joseph Muscat’s 2017 cabinet including European commissioner Helena Dalli from becoming president, Nationalist Party sources said. MPs agreed at a parliamentary group meeting on Tuesday they would not support the nomination of any individual the Daphne Caruana Galizia public inquiry found shared responsibility for the journalist’s murder. The idea was proposed by leader Bernard Grech and found unanimous support among his parliamentary group. This makes it virtually impossible for any minister in Muscat’s cabinets to make it to San Anton Palace this April as, for the first time, the new President will require the support of both the government and the opposition. The public inquiry had concluded that the State “should shoulder responsibility for the assassination”. It had also singled out the former prime minister, Muscat, for enabling a culture of impunity and found his entire cabinet collectively responsible for their inaction in the lead up to the assassination. One of Muscat’s former cabinet members was Dalli, who, several government and opposition sources say, was recently being touted for the country’s highest office. When contacted on Wednesday, she said she had “no comment to make” on “rumours” about her possible nomination. Dalli, whose term in Brussels ends later this year, was in cabinet throughout Muscat’s tenure and was European affairs and equality minister when Caruana Galizia was murdered in October 2017. Evarist Bartolo, education minister under Muscat, has previously dismissed speculation that he was being considered for the post. Robert Abela and Bernard Grech met last week to discuss Malta’s next President but sources said no names were exchanged in that first, introductory meeting. They are expected to meet again “in the coming days”. The public inquiry board had slammed cabinet for failing to protect those at risk and assuring good governance and the rule of law. “Not only did the government fail to take any action to remedy the situation but cabinet and the parliamentary group gave their support through votes of confidence to those involved,” it said. Cabinet’s decision to “look the other way” meant ministers were effectively endorsing the decisions by the prime minister to let everything slide and, at the very least, their inaction was a “grave omission” that in a democratic society should have consequences. Following changes to the constitution in 2020, Malta’s next President will have to be appointed by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members of the House of Representatives. All previous presidents only needed a simple majority after being proposed by the government. This will be the first time that both sides of the House must agree on a name. President George Vella’s five-year term ends on April 1 and cannot be renewed. The government, can, however, nominate an acting president until agreement is reached on a successor. Abela told reporters last week he was convinced he could reach a sensible agreement with the opposition if they put their heads together but stopped short of saying that, in case of an impasse, the government should enjoy the upper hand. “Indeed, the two-thirds majority rule is now entrenched [in the constitution] but the constitutional reform must respect the equally important principle of democracy meaning the sovereignty of the majority of the people must be respected as well,” he said. The PN immediately hit back, insisting the president should only be appointed following an agreement from both sides. Neither side can dictate what will happen, arbitrarily, before discussions even kick off, the party said. “The president should be a person who unites the Maltese and Gozitans, irrespective of where they come from,” it said. The president of Malta is a largely ceremonial role. But a president’s signature is the final step in the legislative process and no law can come into force without it. While a president has never blocked a law by refusing to sign it, the country is believed to have come close to such a crisis during Vella’s tenure, when he told his inner circles he was prepared to resign if an abortion law as originally proposed by the government in 2022 was passed through parliament. Abela has already publicly hinted he is looking for a “progressive” president and sources believe the abortion issue will be one of the most likely bones of contention in talks between him and Grech. In an interview with Times of Malta in 2022, Abela ruled out the possibility of former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi becoming president. He said at the time that a president should unite the country and that “a leader of a political party can never unite a nation”.

"It's not about a single person, Bernard Grech says about his weak trust rating",Times of Malta,"Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech reacted on Wednesday to trust ratings showing him way behind Prime Minister Robert Abela, insisting that solutions for Malta did not lie in one person but in everyone doing his part. He was replying to a question by Net TV interviewer Trevor Degiorgio who recalled, how, three months before the 2008 general election, surveys had shown the PN trailing, but then party leader Lawrence Gonzi was leading Labour leader Alfred Sant in the trust ratings. The PN eventually won that election (albeit by a whisker). The latest Malta Today Trust Barometer showed Robert Abela at 41.1% and  Grech at 16.7%.  Grech pointed out that the important thing was that according to the surveys, in the past two years the PN had cut Labour's lead from the last general election by more than half, even though his trust rating had gone down. He recalled that even before he became party leader, he had declared that he did not have all the solutions for the country. This country, he said, would not be pulled up from the depths it had sunk to by some 'messiah'. Similarly, no single person could make the PN instantaneously perfect, now or in the future. It was for the people, all together, to understand that they each had a duty to restore the country in all its sectors. He was not shrugging off his own responsibility, Grech said. As party leader he set direction and indicated how he wished to see things, but everyone had his own responsibilities.   For example, he said, there were hundreds of academics, but only a few, maybe five, spoke up, whereas abroad the academic body was vociferous in national issues. The same applied to those in business and in financial services. They complained to him, but then they said they were afraid to speak up because they would lose money or contracts. “You cannot just look at your own patch, beyond your patch there is a reality, a country, and the future of your children to consider. I took my decision and am working and determined to do more,” Grech said. “The moment that I see that my presence could be an obstacle, I will do the responsible thing because the country is bigger than me,” he said. Replying to various other questions, Grech asked who would assume responsibility if Malta did not recover the €400 million given to Vitals/Steward in the hospitals deal which was declared fraudulent by the courts. ""Who will assume responsibility when the funds disappear,?"" Grech asked.  He pointed out that one of the reasons for the deterioration of the health service was the way funds were squandered by this deal. And yet Prime Minister Robert Abela was not fighting to get the money back, he said. Grech criticised the prime minister for refusing to give interviews and hold debates. He spoke about a worsening quality of life and said the PN wanted to change Malta's economic direction from one of quantity and mediocrity to quality and high standards. An example, he said, was in tourism. A time would come when Malta would not be able to handle greater numbers, he said, and ways had to be found to grow the sector without a great number of visitors. The answer lay in attracting higher spending quality tourists. The economy also needed to grow in areas which did not need more foreign workers, he said, although some foreign workers would still be needed for some sectors.

Grech complained on Tuesday that PBS had wrongly reported him on its broadcasts and website as saying that climate change action would harm the economy. Its headline was: ‘PN leader says climate change is an obstacle to economic growth’. Grech made his remarks during the debate on the setting up of a Climate Change Agency.  In his ruling, Farrugia said the headline and part of the story did not reflect what Grech said and ordered PBS to correct the report.

Three-year-old Gaza girl Selah brought to Malta's parliament,Giulia Magri,"Selah Hajras, a young Palestinian girl brought to Malta for urgent medical treatment, was in the stranger’s gallery in parliament on Wednesday.  It was the young child's second public event involving politicians in as many days.  Selah, 3, was injured in an Israeli air strike and arrived in Malta on Tuesday to receive medical treatment at the invitation of Malta's government. She was carried into the arrivals hall by Palestine's ambassador to Malta, having met with Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia shortly after landing.  At the beginning of Wednesday’s plenary sitting, Speaker Anġlu Farrugia started the session with the usual prayer and said Selah, her father Ashraf and the Palestinian ambassador to Malta, Fadi Hanania were present. He said that he dedicated the prayer to Selah and the children of Palestine and prayed for an end to the war.    Opposition leader Bernard Grech also met with Selah during parliament's Wednesday session and gave her a gift and card, a PN spokesperson said.  Selah suffered severe leg injuries when her house in Southern Gaza was hit by an Israeli airstrike in November. She lost her mother and brother in the attack.  Her father, Ashraf, was not injured and initially believed Selah had also been killed in the bombing. It was only when doctors posted a video to YouTube showing Selah at hospital that her father realised she was alive. Palestine is currently forbidding men under 60 from leaving the country, meaning Ashraf and his daughter had to be smuggled into Egypt.  Malta offered to cover the costs of her medical treatment at Mater Dei Hospital, with Saint James Hospital, a private medical facility, making a similar offer.  The two landed in Malta from Egypt on Tuesday afternoon. Their flight was funded by public donations and the Palestinian Embassy in Malta, with support from the Maltese government.  Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said that seeing Selah present in Parliament is a stark realisation of the true ugliness of war.  ""We should be proud that as a country we provide aid and help when we can, instead of dropping bombs,"" he said. He explained how the ministry coordinated with other entities to bring Selah and her father safely to Malta. He said the ministry dealt with providing the necessary visas and documents to allow the family in Malta, and the Health Ministry offered to cover all the necessary medical treatment.

Watch: Head of Migrants Commission calls for a fair migration policy,Sarah Carabott,"The Church’s Migrants Commission director has called for immigration policies that are fair to hundreds of people who, through no fault of their own, have been allowed to live and work here for several years despite not being granted asylum. Fr Anton D’Amato was speaking to Times of Malta after the story of Kusi Dismark, a man who has been detained with the intention of being deported after 13 years in Malta. As a person who has been denied asylum, Kusi was allowed to work in Malta and pay his dues but had no access to free education and healthcare. He financed his studies, opened a hair salon in Ħamrun and was planning on expanding his business until he was arrested on January 21.   Kusi’s sudden arrest and detention sent shockwaves among his circle of friends, Maltese landlords and civil society. Kusi is not the only person with the threat of deportation hanging over his head. Malta has a right to return people who are denied protection, however, not all are repatriated. Some countries of origin fail to provide official documentation for those handed a removal order or refuse to recognise the migrants’ claimed nationality.  RELATED STORIES  Fr D’Amato told Times of Malta that the same system that gave a person the right to a job and the obligation to pay social contributions and tax could not tell that same person that “there is a small part that is not regular, so forget all your contributions, your connections in Malta, pack your bags and leave. Although it might be the law, it is definitely not just”.   He called for policies that are not just based on legislation but also justice. “While the system should be based on strong legal principles, it should ensure that whoever lives in Malta lives a decent life and, as much as possible, also ensure we aren’t the ones who throw the person into irregularity,” he said. Fr D’Amato noted that the current policies led to delays in decisions about asylum – the application for which was a fundamental human right, while also allowed the State to decide on implementing a removal order following several years of that person living in Malta.  “A person lives here 10 years, pays tax,  while contributing to society and the community he forms part of. Then, suddenly, is he no longer good enough to form part of our society,” Fr D’Amato asked. “It’s not enough to say that the State has a right to remove people who are not regular. The State should do everything possible to regularise the situation of several people – in their hundreds, probably thousands – who arrive in Malta, contribute to society for years, live in the best possible way they can, make friends, have children and build a family here. Ultimately, although the removal order is the law, it is not just.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Opt-out organ donation shift backed by PN, health minister",Daniel Ellul,"A private member's bill to shift to an ‘opt-out’ system for organ donation is to be presented to parliament on Wednesday and it already has the backing of the health minister. Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo will present the amendment to Malta’s organ donation laws to the Speaker as a private member’s bill. “Not only do I support the bill but I am also happy to second it,” Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said.  If passed, the bill would see a major change to the system. As it stands, people need to ‘opt in’ by registering to donate their organs for transplants after they die.  The bill proposes to reverse that so that anyone over 16 would be presumed to have given consent to donating their organs unless they had stated otherwise. It is the second time the idea has been proposed, with a previous attempt in 2015 discarded after public consultation.   Bartolo, who previously donated one of his kidneys to a stranger, said he believed an opt-out system can significantly cut down waiting lists for organ transplant operations. “For me, I would prefer it if my death means that I am saving someone else’s life rather than being buried with my organs,” he said. He said a strong authority would be needed to make sure donated organs are put to good use and that there is no abuse. Bartolo also suggested there should be provisions to make sure the wishes of family members of the deceased would continue to be respected. “Family members of a deceased person should still always have the last say on what happens to the body,” he added. After the ‘bill to amend the act on the donation of organs, tissues and human cells’ is presented to the Speaker, it is up to the government to bring it to the House. It will then be debated in plenary and go to the committee before a final vote. “I’m sure that between then and now, there would be consultation with stakeholders, debates and amendments that come as a result,” Bartolo said. A PN spokesperson said that the party supports the bill while the health minister said that a framework that actively encourages organ donation is needed to increase the number of donations. According to the Health Care Standards Directorate, there were just over 27,000 registered organ donors in Malta in 2022. “New legislation at minimum would increase awareness of the need for more organ donors,” he said. “An organ transplant can completely change someone’s life. With a cornea transplant, for example, a person can literally see again.” Still, Malta’s cornea transplant rate is very low, he said. The move comes years after the idea was first proposed and then discarded following a public consultation exercise in 2015 that found just 8% of respondents favoured some form of opt-out system. Among those who opposed it were the Church, which said that organ donations should remain a free decision of the donors. An increasing number of countries, including Spain, Singapore, Austria and Belgium, have adopted the system. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Watch: Health Minister refuses to say why he changed FMS head,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The Health Minister on Tuesday refused to say why he changed the head of the Foundation for Medical Services (FMS), simply arguing that it was his prerogative. Jo Etienne Abela said the decision was not whether former head Carmen Ciantar was not doing her job well. ""She used to occupy a position of trust at FMS, and as usually happens when the minister is changed, people in positions of trust resign,"" he told Times of Malta. Asked why he accepted Ciantar's resignation when he could have refused it, Abela would only say it was his prerogative. Ciantar, a close political aide to former health minister Chris Fearne, did not have her term as FMS CEO renewed following last month's cabinet reshuffle in which Jo Etienne Abela was appointed health minister. All heads of government entities are expected to submit their resignation letters once a minister is replaced.   Initially, Mark Mallia was announced as her replacement, only to be appointed head of Transport Malta less than two weeks later. On Tuesday, Abela said Mallia chose to take the other job, as was his right. ""I spoke to him several times and shared my ideas on the vision for FMS, which is crucial for the advancement of healthcare,"" he said. ""He has a very good track record and that's why I offered him the position. But he had other plans. It's a free country and he decided to choose to go to Transport Malta."" Mallia's appointment was confirmed on Friday afternoon by the Transport Ministry, which said he would assume the role ""with immediate effect"".  It is not yet clear who will now assume the top FMS role, but Abela hinted it will be someone ""with a medical bent"". He said the appointment will be announced ""in the coming days"".

Architect behind Paola Square's design blasts road's resurfacing with asphalt,Daniel Ellul,"The architect behind the Paola Square revamp on Tuesday hit out at the authorities for resurfacing the road within the square with asphalt, replacing the cobblestone paving that was originally laid as part of the project just over five years ago.   The “dream” of a square in the south that prioritised pedestrians had been “crushed,” architect Christopher Mintoff said. “The cobblestones have been replaced with the same material that is found in every bypass and main road,” Mintoff said.   The state of the road had been the source of complaints by motorists for years, and Transport Minister Chris Bonett told parliament on Tuesday that repair works were now almost done.   Infrastructure Malta had said earlier this month that the road between Luqa Road and Antoine De Paule square had suffered “considerable damage”.   The square was paved as part of a revamp costing €3 million that was completed only five years ago, running into controversy when large mature ficus trees were replaced with saplings. The project’s architect had defended that decision, saying the ficus trees were damaging underground utilities.  On Tuesday, Mintoff again defended the project and said that the cobbled street was well-engineered and met project specifications.     “However well you design or build it, you cannot protect it from its users. Heavy traffic was meant to be banned from the square (to reduce noise, pollutants, etc). Yet, before the materials could fully cure, the square was used as a diversion for the heaviest of industrial traffic while the Marsa project was taking place,” he said.   He said authorities were “very aware” of this issue.   “The main initial damages were visibly shaped by the braking force of multi-wheelers that should have been banned by design. Once the paving came loose, traffic wore it down faster,” he said.   Mintoff said that, unlike the newly resurfaced asphalt road, the cobbled street promoted slower traffic, smaller vehicles and more pedestrian activity in the square.   Contacted for comment, Paola mayor Dominic Grima said that asphalt was used for resurfacing because repair works were “urgent”, admitting that the cobbled paving was aesthetically more pleasing than the asphalt.   Making the point that the square is a central government project, the mayor said that the square's design should be revisited to make it more attractive.

People with dementia in Malta expected to double by 2050,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The government launched a national strategy on Tuesday to combat the growing problem of dementia, as the number of people with the condition in Malta is expected to more than double between 2018 and 2050.  A total of 6,552 were registered to have dementia in 2018. That figure is expected to reach 14,117 by 2050.  The increase is due to a significant rise in the number of people aged over 75 and particularly those over 85 years, which is expected to more than triple by 2050, according to the experts behind the initiative. Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela, who launched the strategy, said one of the main reasons dementia has become more prevalent is increased longevity, which is a major risk factor for the development of the condition. ""The more we improve our healthcare system, the longer people will live, the higher the number of people who make it to an advanced age, and the more likely they become to develop dementia,"" he said on Tuesday. ""This is a paradox we cannot escape from, but I am thoroughly proud of the improvements we've made in this sector."" The seven-year National Dementia Strategy aims to ""reach new heights"" by significantly improving the quality of life and services of people with the condition. The strategy will strive to increase awareness and understanding of dementia, educate the public and train healthcare personnel to detect the symptoms and diagnose it as early as possible, help diagnosed people live well with dementia and increase general awareness on how to reduce the risks. Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to several conditions and symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills, severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, causing problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. Precautionary measures include reducing obesity, promoting balanced diets, quitting smoking and alcohol consumption, encouraging social engagement, and preventing or managing diabetes, hypertension and depression. The latest studies show such measures could help the population reduce the risk of developing the condition, the strategy said. According to Eurostat data published last October, Malta recorded the highest rate of deaths caused by dementia in Europe, with just over 80 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020.   The strategy also aims to train a workforce of qualified professionals who can support the growing population of dementia patients. Some people will have developed the symptoms while they're still at work - that is, before retirement age - or while they live an independent life or take care of other people who are dependent on them, and others who are non-Maltese people working in Malta. ""We must remember these people are often not surrounded by families who can immediately detect symptoms of dementia, so it will be harder for them to be diagnosed and seek help,"" Active Ageing Parliamentary Secretary Malcolm Paul Agius Galea said. ""It is crucial to learn how to detect the symptoms early and act on them as quickly as possible, and if we work together we can achieve that level of education among people."" The strategy also aims to invest in local research on the condition to base decisions on the best scientific evidence available and explore the use of technology to support independent living. Rita Vella, a 54-year-old public service employee, helped a team of experts compile the strategy after she was diagnosed with an early onset of dementia a few months ago. ""I had felt a hunch that something changed in my life. One day, while driving my car, I found myself in a place far away from my actual destination,"" she recalls. ""This made me realise I should seek professional help. After several tests I was told by consultants that I had dementia and that there is nothing they can do to make it better."" She still manages to live independently, but her family and friends check on her frequently.  ""I cook, do the laundry, clean the house, and take care of my pet who I love to bits. He truly protects me when he feels mummy is not feeling well,"" she says. ""I love music, as it calms me down. I constantly work to gain more positive attributes to make my life more serene and be an instrument of great joy to others.""

PA refuses permit for Sliema petrol station's reopening,Times of Malta,"The Planning Authority on Tuesday turned down an application for a disused petrol station on Tower Road, Sliema, to be upgraded and reopened. The 76-square-metre facility lies between the Plaza Hotel and the Carlton Hotel, metres away from bars and restaurants. The Development Control Commission explained that the reopening of the petrol station would cause 'operation challenges' since it was within an area which had seen considerable growth in residential and tourist accommodation. It would also generate additional traffic. The application for a permit was submitted by Michael Attard Services Ltd, who sought to upgrade the existing, disused fuel station including all ancillary facilities, and the upgrading and refurbishment of underground fuel tanks having a capacity of 60,000 litres of fuel. Residents had voiced strong safety concerns, pointing to its proximity to two hotels, bars, restaurants and residences. The case officer had recommended approval of the application after no objections were made by the Environment and Resources Authority, Transport Malta, the Regulator for Energy and Water Services, REWS, and Enemalta, among others.   Objectors argued that the fuel station, which has been out of use for years, was extremely close to established residential, tourism and entertainment uses, making it incompatible with its surroundings. Moreover, the cars exiting from the fuel station would cause an obstacle to traffic entering the sharp bend of Old College Street. Residents also complained about the “unjustified” loss of valuable parking in the busy area. They pointed out that another petrol station was located just 68 metres away.

PN MP suggests renaming Russian embassy street to Triq Navalny,Daniel Ellul,"PN MP Beppe Fenech Adami proposed to rename the street next to the Russian embassy in memory of Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny, who died in prison last week.  Navalny, a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, died in mysterious circumstances last Friday in a Siberian penal colony north of the Arctic Circle.  During Tuesday’s plenary session, Fenech Adam, the foreign affairs shadow minister, suggested that Triq I-Ciefa, which is beside the Russian mission’s main entrance and on the street of the embassy’s visa and consular section, be renamed for Navalny.   “Let us not be fooled; Putin’s hand was behind Navalny’s death. Navalny loved Russia, but more importantly, he loved liberty,” Fenech Adami said.   Parliament also held a minute’s silence in honour of the Russian opposition leader.   To change a street name, local councils need to recommend the new name to the Electoral Office’s Street Naming Committee.    San Ġwann mayor Trevor Fenech said the council has not been contacted on the suggested. Once formally asked, the council can discuss the proposal.  This is not the first time there have been efforts to change the name of the streets near the Russian embassy.   In 2022, during the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, an online campaign suggested renaming the Kappara embassy road to Ukraine Street.   Fenech Adami's proposal comes a day after activists convened outside the entrance of the Russian Embassy to pay tribute to Navalny.    But the flowers, candles and photos laid outside the embassy were cleared minutes after the activists left.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Vehicle insurance premia rose to €139.1m last year from €122.6m in 2022,Times of Malta,"Insurance premia for road accidents rose to €139,151,769 last year from €122,681,572 the year before, the finance minister said in reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday. The premia reached €114,861,402 in 2021. The minister told Nationalist MP Adrian Delia that according to information collected by the MFSA, several firms had raised their insurance premia for vehicle insurance. He explained that those increases were not meant only to cover a projected increase in road accidents, but also to cover other costs that could impact claims, such as inflation. Other reasons could include an increase in the number of policies, reflecting an increase in the number of new vehicles on Malta's roads.  On Monday, Caruana said in reply to another question by Delia that Gross Claims Incurred in 2023 reached €64,852,888 last year from €69,368,30 in 2022 and €63,291,020 in 2021.

‘I am ready to die’: Palestinian-Maltese woman set to go on aid journey to Gaza,James Cummings,"A Palestinian-Maltese woman who will be travelling with a shipping container carrying donations from Malta said she is “ready to die"" to make sure it reaches Gaza.   On Tuesday, food, clothing and other items collected by volunteers over the past few months were loaded into the container in Marsa before being shipped to the Gaza Strip later this week.    A second container has also been filled and will leave if the funds for the shipping costs can be raised while donations are open to fill a third.  Speaking to Times of Malta, Arabic Culture Information Society (ACIS) president Sanaa El-Nahhal admitted she was scared about her upcoming journey to make sure the donations reach Gaza.     “I would be lying if I said that I wasn't afraid, but I try to hold it in. But, of course, I'm scared because this is not a normal war. This is a reckless war; they’re killing children and women”, she said.   “I’ve seen many wars in Gaza, and I’ve been going there since 2009. But this war in particular, it is death itself. I am ready to die.”   Describing the journey to Gaza as “very hard”, El-Nahhal said that despite warnings from her family in the region that she would face difficulties, she is determined to get there.   “All my family and children tell me that I can’t go in, but this is my thing – I want to go in. I don’t know where I got this strength, but perhaps it’s because I hear all these stories from my family. And I just got this urge to move, to do something.”  In an interview with Times of Malta in October, El-Nahhal said she received distressing news from family members in Gaza “almost every 10 minutes”. She has siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins in war-torn Gaza.  Explaining she had been sending small items and money to the region – which she described as a “small miracle” – since the start of Israel’s offensive in the region, El-Nahhal said she quickly realised more help was needed.   After discussing the issue with a friend, they decided to send a shipping container of donations to Gaza, the results of which could be seen on Tuesday. “We did this big miracle with the Maltese people, the [Foreign] Ministry and our friends at ACIS. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.” The society has been collecting donations from the Maltese public over the last few months, including holding a charity Bazaar in San Ġwann in November. Speaking outside the shipping container on Tuesday, Palestinian Ambassador to Malta Fadi Hanania said this represented a vital lifeline for those in the region. “Our people in Palestine rely on the support of the international community to help us end the suffering of our people. After more than four months... [we] are looking for people to stand with humanity, to stand with justice,” he said.   ""These donations, as small as they are, mean a lot to our people. People in Gaza are starving. Pregnant women do not find food to feed themselves and their unborn children. “The situation in Gaza is so devastating that people are still hoping the international community will stand in solidarity with our people to implement justice, to implement the UN resolutions and to stop the suffering of 75 years of occupation”, Hanania said. ""Any small donation from the Maltese people means a lot to the Palestinians. Yes, we have to go through a lot for this delivery to arrive in Gaza. But we are still determined to collect more and more donations to our people in Palestine.” Hanania added that the embassy was working on sending another container to the region and urged people to continue donating. He thanked the Maltese people and the Foreign Ministry for their support. Once the shipping container leaves Malta, it will face a long and difficult journey across the Mediterranean and through Egypt on route to the Rafah crossing on the border with Gaza.   The crossing is at present one of only two entry points still open on the border with Egypt along with the nearby Karem Shalom crossing. Both face regular closures and there have been frequent reports of Israeli forces turning items away under their strict “dual use” policy, which prevents items from entry which Israel determines as also having a military application. According to Reuters, water purifiers, medical supplies and tent poles are among the items which have been blocked from Gaza under the policy. Israel’s offensive in Gaza began in October after Hamas militants attacked the country by land, sea and air, killing around 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages. Earlier this month, Malta’s UN ambassador Vanessa Frazier described Hamas’ actions as “demonic” in an interview with Times of Malta following her visit to Israel in January. However, Frazier has stressed that the terrorist group’s actions do not justify alleged Israeli breaches of humanitarian law in its conflict with Hamas. More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of Israel’s offensive in the region, according to Gaza health officials.

Jesper Kristiansen gets 40 years for Sliema double murder,Claudia Calleja,"One of three men charged over a double murder in Sliema was jailed for 40 years on Tuesday following a plea bargaining deal. Jesper Kristiansen was accused of murdering Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski at their Sliema home in August 2020. Kristiansen, 34, a Danish national, had fled Malta following the murder but was arrested 10 days later in Spain, after Spanish police tracked him down in Cadiz. He was extradited to Malta to face criminal charges. The other two men facing murder charges in the case are Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national Viktor Dragomanski. Prosecutors opted to charge the three separately but last week they informed the Criminal Court that the three had been put together under one joint bill of indictment. Last week, Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras took note of a joint note filed by the prosecution and Kristiansen's defence team, which said that the parties had agreed on the terms of a plea bargain. The court was informed that Kristiansen would enter a guilty plea against the agreed punishment of 40 years and his share of court expenses. The accused, assisted by lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto, confirmed that he understood the implications of that note. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta then asked for the separation of proceedings, meaning that Dragomanski and Muka would part company with Kristiansen. Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison if found guilty. Once his plea deal is formalised, he will be able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. Speaking to Times of Malta after Kristiansen admitted to the charges, the families of the victims said this was ""the first step towards closure"". ""Hopefully, this conclusion is the first step in bringing closure, although nothing can be done to bring the loved ones back,"" Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski - the brothers of murdered men, Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski - told Times of Malta. ""Needless to say, we now look forward to the swift closure of all three cases pending trial,” they had said. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta is prosecuting.

"Three-year-old Selah, hurt in Gaza bombing, lands in Malta for medical treatment",Giulia Magri,"Three-year-old Selah Hajras arrived safely in Malta for medical treatment on Tuesday afternoon.  Selah was accompanied by her father, though it was Palestine's ambassador to Malta who carried her into Malta International Airport's arrivals hall to the sound of camera shutters clicking.  The young girl blew kisses and smiled as people crowded around her, with some young children offering her soft toys and balloons.  Selah suffered severe leg injuries when her house in Southern Gaza was hit by an Israeli airstrike in November. She lost her mother and brother in the attack.    Her father, Ashraf, was not injured and initially believed Selah had also been killed in the bombing. It was only when doctors posted a video to YouTube showing Selah at Nasser hospital that her father realised she was alive. Palestine is currently forbidding men under 60 from leaving the country, meaning Ashraf and his daughter had to be smuggled into Egypt.  Malta offered to cover the costs of her medical treatment at Mater Dei Hospital, with Saint James Hospital, a private medical facility, making a similar offer.  The two landed in Malta from Egypt on Tuesday afternoon. Their flight was funded by public donations and the Palestinian Embassy in Malta, with support from the Maltese government.  ""We will look after Selah with all our hearts,"" Prime Minister Robert Abela said following her arrival.    Palestinian ambassador Fadi Hanania described the child as ""an icon... [she] is our hope, Selah is a witness that the people killed in Gaza are civilians. ""30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, half of them are children and woman,"" Hanina said.  ""Yes, our people will rise and build our beloved Gaza. Thank you for your donations to make this trip possible. Thank you all for helping Selah.""  The Palestinian Ambassador thanked the Maltese government and also thanked Prime Minister Robert Abela, who also greeted Selah.

Man charged with trafficking 54 kilos of cannabis,Claudia Calleja,"A 47-year-old Sicilian was brought to Malta, from Spain, on the strength of a European arrest warrant and charged with trafficking 54 kilos of cannabis. Fabio Nastasi, 47, appeared before Magistrate Rachel Montebello and pleaded not guilty to conspiring to deal in the drugs, trafficking, and possession with the intent to sell on and before June 2023. Police Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca told the magistrate that in June 2023, the police arrested Sicilian Santo Arena in connection with the discovery of around 54kg of cannabis in St Paul’s Bay. He was charged with trafficking and aggravated possession of approximately 54kg of cannabis in the apartment. The drugs were estimated to have a street value of around €880,000. During the court case, Arena mentioned that a certain Fabio Nastasi had paid him to keep the drugs at this house. As the name of Nastasi was shared in the media, police were informed that he fled the island. A European arrest warrant was issued and, 40 days ago, the police were informed that he was arrested in Spain. He was brought to Malta on Monday night.

Paola mayor fumes as demolition site ends with rubble on road,Times of Malta,"Updated 4.25pm Workers demolishing a house in Paola dropped bricks and construction rubble onto the street on Tuesday, prompting an outraged reaction from the town’s mayor. Mayor Dominic Grima said workers had closed off Triq l-Arkata to carry out the demolition works before the council issued a permit allowing them to do so. The developer had applied to close off the street this Thursday. But instead, works moved ahead on Tuesday morning.   ""He just began work without informing anyone,"" he said.  Grima said the street had been closed off to traffic.  ""As far as I know, cars were not passing through, but people still could walk by the street,"" he said.    Grima said he informed the authorities as soon as residents brought the situation to his attention. Photos published on social media showed parts of the street and pavement outside the construction site covered in rubble and dust. By law, demolition works should be walled off and rubble contained within the development area. The Building and Construction Authority told Times of Malta that it has imposed daily fines on the developer ""for the absence of appropriate traffic management, enforcement, and warning signs."" It also emphasised that it is ""strictly prohibited"" for demolition debris to be dumped on the street.  The contractor responsible has applied for a licence to operate under new rules that came into force late last year, the BCA confirmed.    According to public documents, the site is being demolished to make way for a complex of 25 apartments and 36 garages. The developer is  Francesco Raniero Grima with Stephan Vancell as the project architect. When Times of Malta visited the area on Tuesday afternoon, the contractor had cleared the rubble away from public areas and moved it into the construction site. A police spokesperson said that the demolition works appeared to have been “planned”. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Marsaxlokk priest's court-seized laptop 'lost',Claudia Calleja,"The court-seized laptop of former Marsaxlokk parish priest Luke Seguna, who is facing fraud charges, cannot be found in the law courts’ exhibit room, a magistrate heard. Court expert Keith Cutajar told Magistrate Rachel Montebello how he was nominated by the court to examine the contents of the laptop. But when he asked the exhibits’ officer for the device, a MacBook, it could not be found. He said the laptop was exhibited in court by the prosecution on June 19, 2023. Since it is bulky it is not kept with the court documents but sent to the exhibits’ room after a registration number is allocated to it. Cutajar said that, when he asked for the laptop and produced the relevant dates and number, he was told by the exhibit officer “we can’t find the laptop”. The magistrate ordered that the exhibits’ officer be summoned to testify in the next sitting together with the police officer who exhibited it. He was testifying in the compilation of evidence against Fr Luke Seguna who is facing charges of fraud, misappropriation and money laundering, with prosecutors claiming he swindled some 150 of his parishioners out of around €500,000 over a 10-year-span. He is denying the charges. Over a number of sittings since last August, numerous parishioners testified about the valuable work done by Fr Luke for the parish church and the people of Marsaxlokk, some saying that they missed his charitable acts. Witnesses said that they willingly donated funds under the “arbural” system, while others explained that they used to donate money to the priest to be used by him as he best deemed fit. However, prosecutors claim that the priest held hundreds of thousands of euros in various bank accounts, together with a collection of five motorbikes and two cars, despite a relatively meagre income as a clergyman. Several suspicious bank transactions had triggered police investigations in his regard. Some €148,000 were allegedly traced to payment processing companies linked to a porn site, while police also tracked down several cheques totalling around €18,000 issued by a third party to the priest. The case continues. AG lawyers Andrea Zammit and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted. Lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera were defence counsel.

Youths in Floriana gang attack case placed under supervision order by court,Matthew Xuereb,"A judge on Monday issued a supervision order for six youths who allegedly ganged up against a 16-year-old boy, robbing him of cash and stabbing him with a penknife in a Floriana public garden on February 3. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera upheld a request by the attorney general’s office which asked the court to impose harsher bail conditions on the five girls and a boy who stand charged with the assault. Attorney general lawyer Kenneth Camilleri told the court during a hearing on an urgent application filed before the Court of Appeal that the first court had been “very lenient” with the accused, especially after having ignored the prosecution’s concerns about the strong possibility of tampering with evidence. In a decree, the judge said Magistrate Joe Mifsud was not wrong in using his discretion to release the youth on bail but should have imposed different bail conditions, especially since the alleged victim had not yet testified. Last Tuesday, the group, aged between 14 and 20, were charged in court after they were identified as the alleged aggressors behind the mugging that took place on the previous Saturday evening at around 7pm at a public garden just outside City Gate. Police from the Valletta station found the victim lying on the ground, with visible injuries to his face and hands. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sustained cut ligaments in his hands. His injuries were classified as grievous. The 14-year-old boy and five females – one aged 17 from Paola, two sisters aged 14 and 15 from Gżira, a 15-year-old from Valletta and 20-year-old Aicha Mariah from Paola – all pleaded not guilty. Three of the girls were charged with aggravated theft while the 20-year-old was separately charged with unlawful possession of the penknife as well as relapsing. The alleged victim was not only attacked but also robbed of his bag, containing some €90 in cash. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera placed all defendants under a supervision order to ensure they are followed closely throughout the course of the criminal case against them. Moreover, she ordered Aicha Mariah – the eldest of the group – to pay €500 as a bail deposit. The court retained the €2,000 personal guarantee, the curfew between 10pm and 6am, the order to sign the bail book once a week and the strict orders not to approach the victim in any manner.

Controversial DC15 building height limits could be formalised in local plans,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Controversial guidelines on building height limitations could soon be entrenched in Malta's local plans.  The Planning Authority has opened a public consultation process to have those guidelines formalised. Guidelines on overall building height limitations were first published in 2015, in a document titled Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards - more commonly known as DC15. Up until then, height limitations were specified in the number of floors a developer could build. But the DC15 document included a table at its very end - annex 2 - which laid out, in metres, the maximum building height for buildings with basements, semi-basements or without any basement at all.    Activists have over the years slammed the DC15 guidelines, arguing that they are being misused by developers seeking to squeeze more floors out of their projects, contrary to the spirit of the local plans they are meant to interpret. The guidelines have been used to erect scores of new, taller, buildings since then. The Planning Authority is now seeking to entrench those height limits in the country's seven local plans, which were drafted between 1995 and 2006. Local plans set out planners' vision and plans for development within specific areas. As a rule, they supersede all other planning policies and documents.  The PA says it wants to formalise the DC15 height limitations to add clarity and simplicity to planning law.  ""Since 2015, the conversion of diverse building height limitations from local plans required numerous interpretations by development management institutions, including Directorates, Boards/Commissions of the Planning Authority, the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal (EPRT), and the Courts,"" the PA said. ""These interpretations were established through practice over the years but were never formally approved or published."" The PAs proposal for public consultation now reads: “To clarify the provisions of policy P35 of the DC15 in relation to the provisions entitled “Interpretation of building height limitations outside villa/bungalow areas” and specify the number of allowable levels for all the ranges of facade heights and overall heights in metres”. The PA insists this exercise is ""by no means amending the permissible height as already established"". If the guidelines are formalised, a four-storey building, for instance, would be limited to a height of between 20 to 22 metres, depending on the location and whether it also has a basement or semi-basement.  RELATED STORIES  A two-storey building would be limited to a height of between 11.40 and 13.50 metres - again depending on the location, and whether it has a basement and a receded third floor. Gozo environmental NGO Għawdix was not happy about it. In a statement on Monday it said the announcement ""starkly contrasts with recent celebrations by the Ministry for Gozo and Planning regarding victories in preserving globigerina facades"". Last week the PA issued another circular for architects announcing a new requirement for all new buildings in Gozo to have limestone façades. It said that this was part of its effort to preserve, enhance and promote the unique spatial characteristics of Gozo, that make it distinct from mainland Malta. Għawdix said the other circular - on overall building heights - trumps these values. ""It underscores a disregard for the primary concern: streetscape fragmentation due to pencil development, rendering arguments based on a net amount of floors obsolete and potentially exacerbating the issue by allowing for greater density within confined spaces,"" it said. The PA said the proposed height limitations are not applicable in Urban Conversation Areas (UCAs) and Residential Priority Areas including villa/bungalow areas. The conversion of building height limitations can be accessed here. Comments and feedback about the plan are to be sent to consultation_dc15@pa.org.mt by March 11.

Government renting more while its own properties lie vacant,Times of Malta,"The Auditor-General has called on the government to strengthen its estate management function as state-owned entities continue to lease property from the private sector while government-owned properties lie idle. In a report presented to parliament, Auditor General Charles Deguara observed that the leasing of private property by governmental entities has been increasing over the years. At the end of 2022, governmental entities were leasing at least 260 properties from the private sector, excluding property where leasing costs were less than €1,000 annually.  Yet the Lands Authority had more than 4,000 unutilised properties.   The auditor said a range of issues were hindering the Lands Authority from ensuring more effective and efficient estate management. ""The Authority has historically experienced an acute shortage of financial, human and technological resources.  Additionally, most of the unutilised property requires extensive refurbishment at a considerable expense. Such properties cannot be made available for use by government entities in a short timeframe.  Constraints limiting the availability and use of government-owned properties also exist at the Joint Office where complex issues related to the registering of ecclesiastical properties transferred to the State under the 1993 Church-State Agreement prevail,"" the Auditr Office said.  The Office observed that the government has not developed a comprehensive strategy and a detailed action plan for the refurbishment of existing unutilised buildings. The Lands Authority, as the entity responsible for the government’s estate, told the Office that one of its strategic aims was to be able to actively market government-owned properties to increase take-up, thereby making better use of public assets. A refurbishment programme is still at its very early stages and no costing exercises have yet been undertaken to assess the feasibility of undertaking such works. In 2022, the leasing cost of the 260 Government-leased private properties  considered in a preliminary review by the Audit Office amounted to €22 million (excl. VAT).  In 43 per cent of these leases, governmental entities did not carry out a formal or documented needs assessment before leasing private properties. In around nine per cent of the 260 leases, the entities 'diverted' from the Procurement of Property Regulations which came into force in April 2020.   Prior to this date, the procurement and leasing of property was exempted from the regulations.   Two-thirds of the 260 government-leased private properties were used as offices. In six of them, the entities spent more than €1 million on upgrading costs, in addition to the leasing fees. These arrangements had an average lease of 13 years. The Audit Office said the preliminary review uncovered various governance concerns, particularly relating to compliance with the regulatory framework, economy, efficiency, and effectiveness, as well as accountability and transparency.   The Office said it intends to carry out a detailed analysis of a number of the  leasing arrangements.

"Cyberattacks in Malta, Hungary, Ukraine, Bosnia are a 'wake-up call', IPI warns",Times of Malta,"The International Press Institute (IPI) has expressed deep alarm over the recent surge in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks targeting media outlets in Hungary, Bosnia, Malta, and Ukraine. Cyber-attacks pose an increasingly serious threat to media freedom, hindering the free flow of information and obstructing the public's access to independent journalism, the IPI said in a statement. The attacks on Times of Malta as well as media outlets in Hungary, Bosnia and Ukraine are the latest wake-up call that urgent action is needed to protect the digital security of media outlets in Europe and beyond. IPI called on national authorities in Hungary, Bosnia, Malta, and Ukraine, in collaboration with relevant European authorities, to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Addressing the threat from cyberattacks must also be a priority for the EU in the run-up to the upcoming EU elections in June, given the threat such attacks may pose to the flow of information ahead of the vote. Both sustainable financing and technical support are imperative for media to be able to strengthen their cybersecurity defences, ensuring the uninterrupted operation of independent journalism and safeguarding freedom of speech amidst evolving digital challenges. In January, DDoS attacks were renewed against independent media in Hungary, including Media1, Telex, Kecsup, and Forbes Hungary, apparently carried out by an unknown attacker who goes by 'Hano'. Last September, just days after reporting on these events, IPI was itself targeted in a DDoS attack that took its website offline for three days. The attack was also signed by 'Hano'.  On January 8, news outlet BUKA in Bosnia announced on January 8 that its website had been targeted by a large-scale cyber-attack that lasted into early February. In Ukraine, major online outlets Censor.Net, Zn.ua, Ukrainska Pravda, Dim, and Freedom have faced a wave of similar cyberattacks.   On February 6, the Times of Malta website came under a serious DDoS attack that rendered it temporarily inaccessible to readers. Russia hackers claimed to be behind the attack and in a Telegram post said: ""We are not against the country itself and its inhabitants, we are against those who support sanctions against Russia."" In addition to being temporarily offline, some of these media organisations were also forced to block server requests from certain countries in an attempt to limit attacks, preventing readers in those countries from accessing information. “The increase in cyberattacks on news outlets in Europe is cause for serious alarm and demands a strong response from law enforcement authorities, as well as the companies whose infrastructure is being used to target and silence independent media,” said IPI deputy director Scott Griffen. “DDoS attacks are relatively cheap, easy to execute, and exceptionally difficult to trace – but cause serious harm to media outlets’ operations and the public’s right to information, making them a dangerous new tool to attack press freedom."" IPI said stands in solidarity with the affected media outlets and journalists who continue to work under challenging circumstances.

Trelleborg to spend €14m on new equipment as it expands Ħal Far factory,Times of Malta,"Trelleborg is to spend €14m in the coming two years on new equipment which is more efficient and cleaner for the environment, the prime minister was told during a tour of the factory in Ħal Far on Monday. The company started operating in Malta 60 years ago and is a world class manufacturer of advanced sealing solutions, producing high volume O-Ring and engineered molded parts. The new investment follows an expansion of the company's Ħal Far facility by more  6,000 square metres following assistance from Malta Enterprise and INDIS Malta. Robert Abela welcomed the investment and observed that the manufacturing sector is continuing to diversify and create new career opportunities.  During his tour, the prime minister met the management and had a discussion with the workers during which an emphasis was made on the need for ongoing skills training.

Three-year-old Gaza girl to receive medical treatment in Malta,James Cummings,"A young Palestinian girl who was injured in an Israeli airstrike that killed her mother and brother will arrive in Malta on Tuesday to receive treatment.  Three-year-old Selah Hajras suffered severe leg injuries when her house in Khan Younis, a city in Southern Gaza, was hit by an Israeli airstrike in mid-November. The strike left her mother and brother dead with Selah being taken to hospital for urgent treatment. While her father Ashraf was uninjured, he was unable to locate her in the ensuing chaos and believed she had also been killed. It was only when doctors posted a video to YouTube showing Selah at Nasser hospital that her father realised she was alive and went to meet her. The video shows a smiling Selah talking with doctors and walking around the hospital with her left leg in a cast, juxtaposed with footage of explosions and devastated buildings. According to the accompanying text on screen, the three-year-old gave hospital staff “strength and optimism,” and was described as “one of the most important personalities to spread joy in the hospital during the constant Israeli bombardment.”   With his wife and son already killed and Israeli forces stepping up their attacks in Southern Gaza, Ashraf knew he had to get his daughter out of Gaza as soon as possible. While Selah was allowed to leave Gaza because she was on a medical list, her father was refused permission due to rules barring men under the age of 60 from leaving the country. But through the help of a family friend, who started an online funding campaign to raise money for them, Ashraf and Saleh were eventually able to escape Gaza by paying smugglers to take them out of the country via the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. After waiting in Egypt for 10 days for their passports to be issued by Palestinian authorities, the pair are due to leave the region on Monday night, flying first to Dubai and then on to Malta. They are expected to arrive at Malta International Airport on Tuesday afternoon. Their flight out of Egypt was funded by public donations and the Palestinian Embassy in Malta, with support from the Maltese government which has also offered her free medical care at Mater Dei hospital. Saint James hospital also offered to sponsor her medical treatment, according to the Palestinian envoy. Speaking to Times of Malta, Palestinian ambassador Fadi Hanania expressed his “sincere appreciation for all those who donated to help Selah get the proper medical care, and to the Maltese government for their immediate response and assistance."" Meanwhile, on Sunday, Gaza health officials and the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that Nasser Hospital – the second-largest in the Gaza Strip – was “completely out of service” following a week-long siege and a subsequent raid by Israel Defence Forces (IDF). According to the WHO, a team from the organisation was repeatedly refused entry to the hospital over the weekend by the IDF.   On Sunday, Reuters reported there were only 25 medical staff left to care for the around 200 patients believed to be still inside the hospital. According to Gaza health officials on Monday, more than 29,000 people in Gaza have now been killed since the start of Israel’s offensive. Those wishing to assist in bringing more injured Gazan children to Malta for medical treatment or to donate essential aid to Gaza are encouraged to contact the Palestinian embassy on +356 2780 1200. Donations can be sent via Revolut on +356 9961 9998 or by BOV [Bank of Valletta] Mobile pay to the number +356 9992 2000.

Judge dismisses Muscat's attempt to 'start a new case' in hospitals saga,Claudia Calleja,"Joseph Muscat’s attempt to have a new point included in his legal objections to an inquiry he is facing has been rebuffed by a judge. Madame Justice Doreen Clarke ruled that Muscat’s request was “an attempt to start a new case” based on facts that emerged during the case he opened last year. Muscat is claiming that his rights were breached by an ongoing magisterial inquiry into the hospitals privatisation deal that was annulled by the courts last year. The inquiry, which started in 2019, was initiated on the request of NGO Republika and is looking into any criminal wrongdoing by individuals involved in that deal. It originally targeted former ministers Chris Cardona, Konrad Mizzi and Edward Scicluna but was later widened to include Muscat.  In his case, filed in the First Hall of the Civil Court in it’s constitutional  jurisdiction, Muscat is arguing that a section of the Criminal Code which allows a private citizen to request a magisterial inquiry was in breach of his right to a fair trial. The law, he said, did not offer the constitutional guarantees and procedural safeguards granted to people who are investigated following a police report. The fact that he was not notified that he was a suspect breached his fair trial rights, his lawyers say. Muscat also filed a court application a few weeks ago to include another request in his case. His request centred around the laws that regulate the circulation of court documents. These, he said, were in breach of his rights to a fair trial. On Monday, that request fell short. The court decision echoes another one made last month when the court shot down his attempt to force Repubblika to present two court applications that originally triggered the magisterial inquiry. That was another blow to Muscat's attempt to have the magistrate leading the inquiry, Gabriella Vella, removed from the case – a request also turned down by the court. In a Facebook post, Muscat criticised Monday’s court decision, saying that he was being treated differently to everyone else.   “I will see how and what the best way is for me to defend my rights, both in Malta and if necessary abroad. Those who think I will be disheartened truly do not know me,” Muscat concluded. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Johann Grech's €150,000 is another case of pigging out: PN",Times of Malta,"Robert Abela’s government finds it hard to cough up the money for everyday workers but has no problem paying acolytes like Johann Grech €150,000 a year, the PN said on Monday. Opposition MPs Ivan Castillo and Julie Zahra noted that revelations about the film commissioner’s massive salary was yet another example of Labour’s inner clique “pigging out”. “The government gives you crumbs while it feasts and gorges off your backs,” the MPs said in a statement. “At a time when the cost of living is playing on people’s minds, this is the Labour Party’s misguided priority.” The two MPs were commenting on news that Grech, who leads the Malta Film Commission, received an eye-watering €90,000-a-year salary increase in 2023. Grech earned €60,000 a year in 2020 but is now pocketing more than double that, The Shift News revealed on Sunday. A Freedom of Information request showed that apart from a €115,000 basic annual salary, Grech also receives a €11,500 ‘disturbance allowance’, €10,000 in paid ‘expenses’, a fully expensed mobile phone and fully expensed car. News of Grech’s salary made headlines just days after the film commissioner was forced to reveal that he agreed to pay British comedian David Walliams €120,000 to host the 2022 Malta Film Awards. The commission and Tourism Ministry only revealed that after a court ordered them to, following a two-year legal battle to keep Walliams’ fee under wraps. Walliams also hosted another festival organised by the Maltese government, the Mediterrane Film Festival in 2023. Grech and Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo have yet to reveal how much he was paid for that gig. In their statement, PN MPs Castillo and Zahra noted that Grech and the film commission are being probed by the National Audit Office for way in which millions have been spent on rebates to attract foreign film productions. Tourism Minister Bartolo has so far ignored 14 different parliamentary questions requesting details about the money spent on the Malta Film Awards and Mediterrane Film Festival, they noted. Bartolo and Grech had also sought to keep an impact assessment report into film rebates under wraps. They claimed the report proved that Malta earned €3 for every €1 it spent on film subsidies. When Times of Malta asked economists to confirm the report’s calculations, they said they were unable to and called the calculations “exaggerated” and “overstretched”.

"Festa funding combined into single €700,000 scheme",Giulia Magri,"Three existing funding schemes for the traditional festa have been revamped and combined into a single €700,000 scheme.  The ‘Artistic Heritage Scheme’ will provide financial support to band clubs, firework factories, and feast decoration associations involved in organising Maltese and Gozitan feasts during 2024.  The scheme was announced on Monday by Arts Council Malta director of Funding and Strategy Mary Ann Cauchi, who said the revamped scheme saves organisers time from applying for different schemes at different times of the year.   She said that the council’s 2025 strategy places all artists and practitioners at the centre of the its work.  “At the heart of the strategy is the goal of empowering a diverse social and cultural fabric, promoting a participatory approach while supporting diverse communities rooted in traditional activities to engage in arts and culture and embrace local cultural identities,” Cauchi said.  “Initiatives like the one being launched today play an essential role towards executing these goals.” The scheme is open to band clubs, voluntary firework factories, and Maltese and Gozitan feast decoration associations.  Band clubs are entitled to a maximum of €8,000 per project, while each fireworks factory and feast decorations associations’ project can claim up to €5,000 in funds.  If a voluntary organisation has two or three different roles (such as a band club that also organises feast decorations), it is entitled to apply for both funds.  Awarded projects will be able to recover 100% of the eligible expenses. Eligible projects for band clubs include those that invest in musical training and education, restoration, investment in technological set-ups, and collaborations with other band clubs, amongst other eligibilities.  Projects by feast associations can include anything related to the design and manufacture of semi-permanent fest decor, and also educational initiatives, and social and cultural events.  In the case of fireworks factories, the funds can go to investment in safety equipment and machinery, educational resources, infrastructure, restoration work and collaboration with other local and European fireworks factories.  Each association must be a registered voluntary organisation and comply with the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations.  All three funding strands will be available twice throughout 2024, with the first deadline being  April 2 and the second October 8, 2024.  The revamped financial stream sees a 45 per cent increase in support for cultural organisations. ""Applications must be done seriously, and not just for the sake of applying for funding,"" Cauchi said.  Speaking during the press conference, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said the revamped scheme will ensure that every voluntary association that works in the festa sector will ""get a slice of the cake"" when it comes to funding.  “We do this so that our festas can move forward and thrive,” he said.    ""We work to safeguard traditions, and through this new and strengthened investment we are ensuring that all band clubs, all firework factories, and feast decorations associations are given a financial contribution to assist them to continue contributing to the unique identities of our communities.""  He added that the Maltese festa is now recognised by UNESCO as part of Malta’s intangible cultural heritage.  An information session by the Arts Council will be held on February 28 via Zoom for those who wish to obtain more information. Organisers must first register to receive an invitation to the session.

"Local council, culture watchdog object to BOV’s Attard project",Matthew Xuereb,"The Attard local council has joined the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage in strongly objecting to Bank of Valletta’s proposed development on the site of its branch in the locality, insisting it would ruin the heart of the village core. The bank submitted a planning application to demolish its Attard branch and replace it with a five-storey residential complex that will include a branch at ground level. Through PA7606/23, the bank proposed the demolition of the present one-storey branch abutting Triq il-Mosta and Triq ir-Rand to develop an apartment complex with 10 residential units overlying a basement parking area and a branch at ground floor level. A bank spokesperson told Times of Malta that BOV had no intention of getting involved in the property sector and was simply looking to maximise its existing assets and refurbish its branches to better meet the needs of its customers. The proposed development is located in an area characterised by old two-storey buildings and directly opposite the Attard primary school and its adjacent public garden. The garden of the historic Casa De Piro, directly behind the bank’s site, will not be developed. In its objection, the council expressed concerns about the potential adverse impact on the historic and aesthetic integrity of the Attard village core that holds “immense cultural, historical and aesthetic value”. “The proposed project, if approved, has the potential to significantly detract from the charm and character of the Attard village core. The concerns extend beyond mere aesthetics, as the development could cast both a literal and metaphorical shadow over this beloved area. The unique ambience and identity of the village core are invaluable assets that contribute to the well-being and sense of community among residents,” the council said. The proposed additional floors were in breach of planning policies and undermined street character, it said.  Mayor Stefan Cordina urged the bank to revise its proposal: “A radical reduction in scale would not only demonstrate sensitivity to the unique characteristics of the location but also contribute to preserving the integrity and charm of the Urban Conservation Area.” The superintendence insisted that the proposal was “objectionable in principle” and the project was located just 10 metres from wartime public air-raid shelters.  “The proposed replacement building would be totally out of context within the existing urban environment. Furthermore, the proposed excavation would pose a very high level of threat within an archaeologically sensitive area,” it said, adding that the design was “completely incompatible with UCA characteristics”.  It said the projecting building would ruin the traditional streetscape and would impinge on the architectural value and visual integrity of Casa de Piro which, it said, warranted scheduling. The locality’s Socjetà Mużikali La Stella Levantina also objected to the proposed development.

Number of Maltese who travelled abroad in 2023 up by over a third,Times of Malta,"The number of Maltese nationals who went abroad last year increased by more than a third over 2022, according to national data.

Elderly man fractured ex-wife’s finger in assault,Matthew Xuereb,"A 70-year-old man from Żebbuġ was handed a suspended sentence after a court found him guilty of seriously injuring his estranged wife during a domestic violence incident in April 2019.  The court heard the woman testify that the incident happened as she was about to leave the house. Even though her former husband did not live there since he had left the matrimonial home, he happened to be outside the house when she was leaving.  She said he began hitting her, punching her haphazardly and kicked her several times in her stomach, fracturing her finger in the process as she tried to shield herself from the assault.  Medical court expert Mario Scerri noted that the finger was broken in such a way that it will never return to normal. A representative from the police Victim Support Unit said they were following the woman since they were informed of the trouble between the couple and the victim was scared of her estranged husband because he was violent with her.  The man testified that it was his estranged wife who first slapped him across the face when she told him she was not going to sign the separation papers. He admitted that he had two other cases over similar incidents with his former wife.  Magistrate Monica Vella said she would not be taking note of the nephew’s testimony after ruling that he was not a trustworthy witness, since his version of events was not corroborated by any of the other witnesses.  The magistrate rubbished the man’s account that he was acting in self-defence because the evidence showed otherwise.  She jailed him for 18 months suspended for two years and issued a protection order in favour of the victim. She warned the man that he would be fined €2,000 if he molested his estranged wife again within a year.  Police inspector Alfredo Mangion prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Protest in tribute to Alexei Navalny in front of Russian Embassy on Monday,Times of Malta,"Civil society group Repubblika is calling on Maltese and Gozitans to take part in a protest it is organising in front of the Russian Embassy in Kappara on Monday to pay tribute to the late Alexei Navalny. Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, spent his final weeks in a penal colony above the Arctic Circle. His 19-year prison sentence was widely condemned by rights groups and in the West as punishment for daring to cross President Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Russian authorities said Navalny - who survived several Kremlin-linked assassination attempts - died suddenly while taking a walk. Repubblika on Sunday joined many others, including Maltese lawmakers, in expressing shock at Navalny's death. It said Navaly sacrificed his life for the Russian people to acquire freedom and democracy. To silence him, Putin denied him his freedom and now killed him while in prison. Repubblika described Navalny as a modern-day hero because he loved and chose to fight for his country no matter what. So Putin took his life but not his dignity. The protest is being held in front of the Russian Embassy in Kappara on Monday at 7pm. The aim is to spread a message of support and solidarity with his family and with Russian citizen who were fighting to acquire democracy and respect for their fundamental human rights. The public is encouraged to carry photos of Navalny, candles, photos and flowers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Aaron Farrugia nets €33k payout for getting sacked from cabinet,Jacob Borg,"Aaron Farrugia netted a €33,000 payout after getting sacked from cabinet during last month’s reshuffle. Farrugia, a former transport minister, qualified for a €33,385.89 “terminal benefit”, according to details obtained by Times of Malta via a freedom of information request. The benefits are paid to all cabinet members who either fail to get re-elected, resign, get sacked or are not re-nominated to a cabinet post after an election. Farrugia was the only casualty of Robert Abela’s January reshuffle, prompting political speculation about his performance, as well as his relationship with the prime minister. Apart from the severance pay, Farrugia’s unceremonious sacking is set to be further sweetened as the backbench MP is reportedly being lined up as Malta’s permanent representative to the International Maritime Organisation. The Labour MP joins a growing list of other cabinet members who have qualified for generous severance packages despite either being fired or forced to resign. Rosianne Cutajar, who is making overtures to the Labour ranks, was paid €27,000 after being forced out of government in 2021 due to her close ties with murder suspect Yorgen Fenech. Justyne Caruana, a former Gozo minister, netted a €28,000 payout after Abela ditched her from cabinet over her husband Silvio Valletta’s links to Fenech. Times of Malta had revealed how Valletta, a former senior police officer, holidayed with Fenech while he was being investigated for complicity in journalist Daphne Carauana Galizia’s assassination. Former prime minister Joseph Muscat was given a €120,000 golden handshake, despite resigning following weeks of public protests sparked by Fenech’s arrest and allegations his office helped protect key figures allegedly linked with Caruana Galizia’s murder. Muscat has defended his severance package, insisting he got no more than he was entitled to. In 2022, the Green Party demanded an auditor general investigation into the lack of transparency behind these golden handshakes. Abela had defended the payouts, saying they are based on a scheme first introduced by a PN government. Despite receiving these generous payouts, calls for the government to regulate the work politicians can do after leaving the government have been ignored.

‘Impossible’ for Maltese farmers to meet demand – fruit and vegetable importers,James Cummings,"Fruit and vegetable importers have hit back at protesting farmers who want to see restrictions on competing non-EU produce and subjected to more stringent testing. Importers told Times of Malta that without goods from outside the EU to help fill supermarket shelves, demand for local products would skyrocket, sending prices – which they argue are expensive enough – shooting upwards. And they rejected calls for more stringent tests, stressing there was no need for such a measure when foreign products were already being inspected in their home countries and again when imported into Malta. Importers also hit out at the quality of Maltese products, arguing some international restaurant chains and visiting cruise ships did not want to use them because they were often spoiled and lacking internationally-recognised certificates. Their comments came a day after farmers staged a second demonstration against EU rules, driving tractors from Ta’ Qali to Valletta in protest. Farmers called for restrictions on importing competing non-EU products if local supply can satisfy demand and more rigorous testing of goods from outside the union, arguing they are being forced to meet higher standards than their non-European competitors.   But importers have said such calls are unrealistic. “There are not enough [locally produced goods] for all of Malta,” said Mario Mizzi, owner of Mafimex Ltd, importers and distributors of fruit and vegetables. Estimating the country’s yield of marrows as an example, he questioned whether it was enough: “How can you supply the market with 50 tonnes?” Mizzi also thinks that if products from outside the EU were blocked, prices of Maltese products would shoot up because of increased demand. This means international items were helping keep local goods affordable. “Last month, one box of four [wholesale local] cauliflowers was €20 – five euros each. How much are these going to be sold to customers?” he asked, adding that customers were already facing high inflation. Robert Debono of Robert Debono Fresh Fruit & Vegetables Ltd agreed, adding that “even the EU doesn’t have enough supplies for the European market”. And while expressing his support for local produce, Debono said many Maltese goods were “not up to standard”. Citing cucumbers as an example, he said that while those at the top of a crate often looked good, those at the bottom were frequently damaged or spoiled, insisting that many local products were not up to EU standards. Pointing to his own experience supplying cruise ships and brands including Hard Rock Cafe, he said such customers didn’t accept produce without the so-called Globalcap certification, an international food standards organisation. When asked how many local producers used the certification, he said “none have it”. Addressing calls for more stringent tests, Debono stressed imports were inspected by authorities in their country of origin and tested by port authorities upon arrival in Malta. Fresh By Ela founder Mariella Borg said that while most of the products she supplies are Maltese, she is forced to turn to look elsewhere when goods are out of season or cannot be sourced from the EU.  RELATED STORIES  “I want to support local produce one hundred per cent, but I don’t think that’s possible,” said the distributor boss. Asked if she thought blocking imports was a solution to the difficulties farmers say they are facing, she disagreed, stressing that consumers’ changing tastes also had to be considered. “Ready-to-eat avocados come from Brazil – they taste amazing, but we just don’t find them in the EU,” she said, adding the increasing popularity of crops like asparagus out of their traditional growing season necessitated sourcing them from outside the EU. Stressing how people nowadays wanted fruit and vegetables to “have the perfect look”, Borg noted this was another reason for sometimes sourcing produce from outside the EU. She said consumers were less keen on local produce which might not fit their idea of what a certain item should look like, something Welbee’s CEO Jonathan Shaw agrees with. “Maybe some vegetables don’t look as good as those pumped up with pesticides,” he said, arguing for more education about local produce. However, Shaw said the main problem with restricting goods was the opposition to the free market. “Yes, listen to farmers’ demands, but don’t block products; that’s anti-competitive.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Keith Schembri's secret links to consultancy firm triggered corruption concerns,Jacob Borg,"A company secretly backed by Keith Schembri was handed €400,000 in government contracts by Konrad Mizzi’s health ministry, fuelling suspicions of corruption. Government money began to flow just three weeks after the company, Impaqt Limited, was registered in May 2014. A year later, Impaqt paid €193,000 to two companies owned by Schembri, raising suspicions that the payments could be kickbacks in return for the government contracts. Schembri, who is currently facing criminal charges related to bribery and money laundering, served as the all-powerful chief of staff to then-prime minister Joseph Muscat throughout the period. He has long faced accusations, which he denies, of using his time in government to further his business interests. Police were handed details of the suspected scheme in March 2021, following a wider magisterial inquiry into Schembri’s business empire.   The direct orders, for consultancy and project management services, continued to flow to Impaqt, albeit at a slower rate, even after Mizzi was removed from the health portfolio after the Panama Papers scandal. A freedom of information request shows how by the end of 2019, Impaqt had received a further €270,000 worth of contracts from the health ministry, under Chris Fearne, taking the total up to €670,000.   Attached files  The health ministry contracts accounted for just under half of Impaqt’s entire revenues between 2014 and 2020. Impaqt’s registered shareholder and director is Alan Comerford, a British national who, according to his lawyer, moved to Malta in 2012. Although Schembri had no visible link to Impaqt, documents reviewed by Times of Malta reveal his fingerprints all over the company. The €1,200 share capital used to set up Impaqt was paid via a cheque issued by Kasco Engineering in April 2014, documents reviewed by Times of Malta indicate. Financial crime experts questioned why it was Kasco Engineering, rather than Impaqt’s shareholder Comerford, who paid the modest initial share capital. Kasco Engineering is co-owned by Schembri and his business partner Malcolm Scerri. Further suspicions about Schembri’s potential hidden role were raised after investigators discovered how Kasco’s financial controller Robert Zammit had direct access to Impaqt’s HSBC account and was able to execute transactions. Scerri was a co-signatory to the same account, documents indicate. By the end of 2015, after just a year-and-half of operation, Impaqt had netted over €400,000 worth of contracts from the Health Ministry, split across 10 contracts. That same year, payments started to flow from Impaqt to companies owned by Schembri. In April 2015, Schembri’s Kasco Engineering received a €93,000 payment from Impaqt, marked as being for “loan+purchases”. No traces of the initial “loan” between Impaqt and Kasco Engineering was found by financial experts, fuelling suspicions about the reason for the payment.  The payment to Kasco Engineering came three months after Impaqt was awarded a €234,000 contract by Mizzi’s ministry for consultancy services and project management services.   Schembri is already facing money-laundering charges for a suspected fake loan between himself and Nexia BT’s managing director Brian Tonna. The fake loan is suspected to have been used to justify a €100,000 “kickback” on passport sales passed on to Schembri by Tonna. Both men deny the charges.  RELATED STORIES  Impaqt used to operate from the same building as Nexia BT, the now-defunct audit and advisory firm used by Schembri and Mizzi to establish secret companies in Panama. The company shifted to another address just before the Panama Papers scandal broke in 2016 and ditched Nexia BT as its auditors a year later.   Schembri and Mizzi resigned from government in November 2019 under a cloud of corruption claims. Potentially suspicious payments by Impaqt to a design company co-owned by Schembri and his wife Josette  – 3City Designs – were also flagged to the police. The interior design company received €100,000 worth of payments from Impaqt in 2015, marked as being payments for furniture and office improvements. All the payments to 3City Designs were made in round-figure amounts. The first payment, amounting to €20,000, was made in February 2015. Further payments of €5,000, €10,000, €5,000, €30,000, €10,000, €10,000 and €10,000 were made through the same year. Investigators have questioned why a small start-up company would spend such a large amount on office furniture, interior design and refurbishments. Schembri Vella and 3CityDesign were charged with money laundering in September 2021.   A document obtained by Times of Malta indicates there was friction between Comerford and Kasco’s financial controller Robert Zammit over one particular payment to 3City Designs. In the August 2015 letter, Comerford accused Zammit of having used his access to Impaqt’s accounts to carry out an “inappropriate transaction” to 3CityDesign, which is described as a “creditor” in the letter. Comerford warned Zammit that the transaction was carried out without his prior approval. “It is the opinion of the directors that in accordance with the Accountancy Profession Act there has been a breach of professional duty. “Kindly note, that the execution of any future creditor transaction should not be implemented without prior approval from the directors of Impaqt Ltd,” the letter warns Zammit. Contacted for comment, Comerford’s lawyer strongly objected to any suggestion that the payments to Schembri’s companies by Impaqt were a form of kickback. Explaining the nature of the relationship, the lawyer said Comerford first met Kasco Engineering CEO’s Malcom Scerri while working for a multinational company out of Malta. Scerri introduced Comerford to legal and financial practitioners to help him set up Impaqt, the lawyer said. “Being a very small operation, not employing secretarial or accounts staff, considering also that most initial work assignments that Impaqt obtained, through Mr Comerford’s labour, saw Impaqt working closely with Kasco Engineering Group.   “This latter company, for the initial stages, assisted our client in this manner,” Comerford’s lawyer said. The lawyer said Impaqt’s ""loan"" payment to Kasco Engineering was for the initial share capital that Kasco gave Comerford. All other payments to Kasco Engineering were in connection with costs incurred during the setting up of Impaqt’s new offices at Smart City, the lawyer said.  “Allow me to remind you that these offices were in shell form and works that Kasco Engineering had to undertake related to all mechanical, electrical, plumbing services, data and IT services, finishing works and gypsum works. “Design of these offices and relative furniture were all handled by and bought by 3City Designs Limited. “All transactions are duly invoiced, accounted and paid and clearly declared according to law in the company’s audited accounts. All said acquisitions are still physically available for inspection. “My client strongly denies any and all allusion of impropriety, in all its form, with anyone,” Comerford’s lawyer said. When contacted, Konrad Mizzi said he could not comment on the contracts awarded to Impaqt or Comerford, “since I have no access to procurement details”. “However, it is my understanding that civil servants at the Ministry of Health would have followed due process for such contracts and ascertained that the work was duly carried out. “My role as health minister ended in April of 2016, and I understand that Mr Comerford was given direct orders for many years by the ministry of health under the tenure of my successor. “I have no knowledge of any matter relating to Kasco Engineering, or of any connection between Mr Schembri and Impaqt. Any attempt to link me to any suspicion of wrongdoing in this context is absurd,” Mizzi said. Keith Schembri, Malcolm Scerri and Robert Zammit did not respond to a request for comment. When contacted, ex-health minister Chris Fearne said he is not aware of any investigations into Impaqt or Comerford, nor was he aware of any wrongdoing. “Had it been the case, as I have always done throughout my political career, I would have immediately reported them to the Police Commissioner without fear or favour.   “Furthermore, at no point in time did I give any instructions to, nor were any approvals sought from me, by the FMS board in regard to Impaqt Ltd or Alan Comerford,” Fearne said. A spokesman for the police declined to comment. Comeford’s lawyer says his client, a project management consultant, is “a noted specialist in the field, with over 30 years’ experience”. His ties to Konrad Mizzi were first brought under public scrutiny in 2014. At the time, Opposition health spokesperson Claudette Buttigieg had demanded in parliament to be given details about Comerford’s precise role within Mizzi’s health ministry. In a terse reply, Mizzi said Comerford was providing project management and engineering consultancy to the health and energy ministry.   Between 2014 and 2019, Comerford’s company Impaqt received over €670,000 in direct orders and contracts from the health ministry, split across 15 different contacts. These ranged from small contracts worth €4,500 for “project management and engineering consultancy,” to a €36,000 retainer fee and a €234,000 contract for “consultancy and project management services”. In 2020, the Foundation for Medical Services even appointed Comerford as a project manager, on a position of trust basis, with an annual pay of €35,000, plus allowances. This position of trust contract was renewed in 2021 and 2022. This article was produced with support from OCCRP and the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation.

President unveils ‘Dokra' art exhibition in aid of Malta Community Chest Fund,| Daniela Peresso,"President George Vella on Saturday inaugurated an art exhibition entitled ‘Dokra’, in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund, which is “inspired by his presidency’s raison d’être”. The visual art exhibition is being hosted at the Grand Master’s Palace in Valletta and features a variety of works by 40 artists. The word ‘Dokra’ is an old Maltese noun which means safeguarding, vigilance and protection and was seen as a fitting theme and tribute by the organising team to the outgoing president. “Upon receiving the briefing regarding the selected theme, influenced by the presidency’s role as the guardian of Malta’s constitution, I couldn’t help but reflect on how seamlessly this aligns with The Malta Community Chest Fund’s commitment to individuals in need,” said President Vella. The exhibition “promises not only to be a visual feast of artistic brilliance but also an immersive experience amidst the Palace’s historic setting”, explained Lawrence Pavia, chairperson of art4mccf, the Community Chest Fund committee which promotes Malta's visual arts sector. Thanking the artists who donated their works of art, John Huber, chairperson of the Board of Administrators of The Malta Community Chest Fund, said the MCCF was indebted to them and said their talent, hard work, and creativity was very much appreciated. He encouraged art enthusiasts to visit the exhibition and possibly buy the artworks on display. Roderick Camilleri, the curator of the exhibition, said: “The overarching theme is embedded in a vision that promotes conservation. In our contemporary volatile world of incessant uncertainty, this simple notion of ‘Dokra’ speaks volumes.” The exhibition, which is free of charge, is open to the public from Saturday 17th February to Sunday 3rd March 2024 between 5pm and 7pm. Entrance is from the side façade in Old Theatre Street, Valletta. The exhibition is supported by APS Bank, The Point, Heritage Malta, and M. Demajo Group.

ADPD criticises government's 'obsession' with cars,| Daniela Peresso,"ADPD – The Green Party on Saturday condemned the government’s obsession with building a car-centric infrastructure, which it said, leads to a  deterioration in people's quality of life. In a press conference in Swieqi on Saturday, the party explained that while other countries focus on reducing car pollution, the Maltese government is intent on having more and more roads, leading to yet more traffic congestion and pollution. ADPD chairperson Sandra Gauci said the Swieqi and Pembroke flyover and junction projects lack an infrastructure for walking and cycling and will not solve the traffic problems. Neither will the new road passing through Żabbar towards the “failed” Smart City project solve anything, she added. The government’s obsession with cars “demonstrates archaic thinking rather than modern governance with long-term vision”. The latest NSO data confirms that by the last quarter of 2023, almost 440,000 cars were on Maltese roads, which ADPD insists is unsustainable. The recent attempt to reduce car use by making public transport free has not led to the desired results, ADPD secretary general Ralph Cassar explained, as the country's bus service remained inefficient. ADPD critisised the decision to scrap rental e-scooters, saying these should have been better regulated instead.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Major food importer calls out MEP for 'misleading comments' on food prices,Giulia Magri,"One major food importer has called out MEP Alex Agius Saliba's claims that local food importers directly control the prices of products and are guilty of illegal practices. Earlier this week, a European Parliament committee accepted the Labour MEP's request to call on the European Commission to investigate monopolies in food retail in Malta.  Agius Saliba said the island's size and geographical limitations had led to the formation of de facto monopolies where a handful of importers dominate the market.  But on Saturday, Francis Busuttil & Sons Marketing, one of Malta’s main foodstuffs importers, said it never took any advantage of its position and always offered consumers the best prices, despite the challenging economic climate characterised by price increases.   ""We categorically refute the unsubstantiated claim made by MEP Alex Agius Saliba that we are somehow seeking to capitalise on a situation where the price of foodstuffs has risen across Europe,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.  ""We invite Dr Agius Saliba to engage with us directly so he can see the facts for himself.” The spokesperson said Francis Busuttil & Sons does not dictate market prices but is working around the clock to mitigate the situation by negotiating the best prices with international suppliers and local service providers and is trying to optimise its operating costs while prioritising quality.  “While we represent a number of brands, we have no control over the market,"" the spokesperson said.  ""Many of our brands are available locally through other importers and retailers contrary to Alex Agius Salib’s misinformed remarks. ""Furthermore, Francis Busuttil & Sons Marketing does not place any stickers on its products to distinguish them from parallel imports. The only stickers we attach contain an English translation of ingredients whenever this is necessary since this is a legal requirement."" The spokesperson said there have been occasions when the company came across products imported by other importers not following this legal requirement or ignoring quality requirements such as proper temperature control throughout the supply chain process.  ""The reason foodstuffs have increased in price so much is because we are living in a time where several external factors have converged to affect inflation,"" mentioning the disruptions to key shipping routes due to attacks on shipping lines, severe droughts, as well as skill shortages and inflated property prices.  ""Costs have gone up across the board and will continue to do so with new EU Environmental Taxes and ESG requirements. While we agree that we all have a role to play for a more sustainable future, this does come at a cost. To remain a viable business, we are forced to make the necessary adjustments.""

The couple who sold their Fgura home to travel Europe in a van,| Terence Mirabelli,"Charlene Formosa and Chris Borg live in a studio flat on wheels. Their bijou home is a 2009 McLouis Tandy 650 sitting on a Fiat Ducato chassis. What makes them different is that they are constantly on the move, not in Malta but around continental Europe. The Maltese couple are among a growing cohort of young people ditching the confines of the 9 to 5 and adopting “vanlife” – converting vans into homes and travelling wherever their mood takes them.   Before the summer of 2021 both had jobs in Malta. Chris, 34, worked for a bank, with a growing side hustle in photography and videography, while Charlene, 32, was in human resources for a Valletta legal firm. During the week Chris would work at the bank but on weekends, public holidays and during his leave, he would travel to Europe for photo shoots, focusing on hotels. Besides the flying, there was a lot of driving to the various hotels and resorts that commissioned Chris for their marketing visuals. “We loved the drives in the mountains, forests and being in nature generally,” he says. The spark for what would become their new lifestyle was a trip to Slovenia in 2018 when they rented a small campervan and loved the experience, despite, as Charlene recalls, it being “November, and it was so cold, and this tiny van had no heating”. It whet their appetite for the nomadic lifestyle and they decided to adopt it on a full-time basis.   Making the decision to drastically change their way of life wasn’t difficult. “We loved our life but wanted to spend more time in nature and to see more of the world,” says Chris. Additionally, “living in Malta felt overcrowded, especially with the heavy traffic and oppressively hot summers”. Their Fox Terrier, Holly, now nine, was another factor. She was left alone in their flat when they were at work and was looked after by family during their trips. “Our trips were rushed because we felt bad about leaving her behind,” says Charlene. “Now Holly is able to enjoy travelling with us, instead of being locked in an apartment.” They began looking for motorhomes in 2019, but the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 slowed the process.   After a year of research, they eventually found one they wanted online – in France. Buying a motorhome in Malta is not only expensive, but the insurance and duties are steep. The couple used a French brokerage firm to inspect the vehicle and soon were on their way to Paris to collect Tandy, their new tiny home on wheels. By now they had sold their flat in Fgura, resigned from their jobs and readied themselves for full-time van life. Although Chris and Charlene were by now fully committed to the lifestyle they were about to adopt, their friends and families “were a bit confused and didn’t understand what we were embarking on”, says Chris. “Now, after three years, everyone’s got used to our way of life and some family members have come to stay with us in the van.” Their first few months of van life took them to central Europe, where most of Chris’s clients are. “At first, we thought we were just going to circle around Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Czechia and Slovenia,” explains Chris. “And then we discovered YouTube, and we started filming our adventures.” In February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. “We put our travel plans on hold and made our way across Slovakia to the border [with Ukraine] to help out in any way we could.” “We bought food, water, baby food, nappies and some toys,” adds Charlene, and these were all distributed to refugees at various border crossings. Since then, they have divided their time between travelling to new places for their YouTube channel, Travel Tales, and doing photo and video shoots for customers in the hotel and tourism business, which is their main source of revenue. “When I first started off in photography, it was a bit scary that it would be my only source of income,” confesses Chris. “But now I make more money than I did at my old job.” Chris can now afford to “work for only four or five months a year”, although he admits the hours are long and there are no “days off, lots of planning and responsibility… Taking a risk and believing in yourself is key”.   The YouTube channel, with 6,410 subscribers, has become another income stream. Every Sunday evening the couple post a video of their recent travels. In 2022, for instance, they were in Turkey, last year they drove to France, crossed the Channel to the United Kingdom and drove the fabled NC500 around the north of Scotland. In early autumn they drove to the Balkans and explored Montenegro and Albania.   “You have to factor in many variables when planning where to go,” explains Chris. “Where we need to be at a certain time for a job, travel time to the job location, the weather and costs.” Breakdowns also happen but fortunately these are infrequent, and Chris acknowledges he’s had to learn to be a mechanic as well: “I used to drive a Honda but this is completely different. I’ve learnt a lot because of the number of kilometres we drive. We’ve driven about 65,000 kilometres since we bought Tandy.” Life on the road has its high and lows. The most unpleasant experience they had was having to make unforeseen repairs in Germany. “It was quite costly, and we also had to live in the van, parked in a Fiat garage for a week.” One of their best experiences was watching the sunrise in Cappadocia with the sky full of balloons. “That was amazing,” Charlene says. The couple generally avoid cities and big towns in favour of the countryside. This is where they feel they meet “the real people” and enjoy their hospitality, such as overnighting in a cabin in Montenegro with a local family. The lows are missing family “and pastizzi” adds Charlene. Neither has been back to Malta since July 2021 although they keep in touch with video calls. “My brother had a baby whom I haven’t met yet,” says Chris. “Another time there was a surprise party for my father’s birthday, and I could only watch it.” “Sometimes it’s really hard and we have days when we really miss our families,” adds Charlene. However, they don’t dwell on what they’re missing, but on the future.   For now, the couple have no intention of having children; this allows them to have “rough plans for the next five to seven years,” says Chris. “We don’t want to travel to the US or Asia with Holly because it can become difficult with both the travel and the regulations. Since she is nine years old, our current plan is to keep touring around Europe. “There is so much more to see. We also want to revisit some countries and then after that we’ll see what’s next, be it with our van, a new van or something else. “Life is short, and we need to make the most of it,” says Chris. “Travelling and spending time in so many places help you understand how different people live. “You realise that every place has its positives and negatives, and we love the fact that we get to split our year accordingly. When we are in, say, the Balkans we miss the perfection of Austria, Switzerland and Germany, and then when we are back in western Europe, we miss the freedom and craziness of Albania or Turkey. Like this we get to live our lives to the full.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Opera on the life of Daphne Caruana Galizia takes centre stage in Vienna,Giulia Magri,"An Austrian opera based on the life and murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has toured around different towns in Austria and is taking centre stage in Vienna this weekend.  Daphnes Garten (Daphne’s Garden) first premiered in November in a small Eastern Austria town, Oberwart, moving on to two other cities, until finally showing in the capital, Vienna this weekend.  “The opera tells the tale about the personal courage Daphne had to write and tell the truth, even when you know your life could be in danger,” playwright Katharina Tiwald told Times of Malta.  Tiwald is an Austrian poet and playwright who has written over 10 productions, but Daphnes Garten is her first opera. She first wrote the text as a play for a drama competition on the topic 'The Arrogance of Capital' back in 2022.  Tiwald had come across the slain journalist's work before she was murdered.  “One thing that did strike me was when she wrote about Sebastian Kurz, then Austria’s new chancellor,” she said. Caruana Galizia’s blog post on the new chancellor was posted on October 15, a day before her murder.  She also came across a story about how former Austrian finance minister, Hans Jörg Schelling had a furniture company based in Malta, to save taxes.  “I originally began to write a play about Schelling and how he worked on avoiding tax in his business,” she said, describing that the play would have been very political from an Austrian point of view.    “At the same time, I was reading ‘Isola Assassina’ by Carlo Bonini about Daphne’s murder, and by total chance, I stumbled across a talk held by Peter Caruana Galizia, who spoke about how the garden was Daphne's refugee. That is when I knew I had to write about Daphne.” The music was commissioned by Erling Wold from San Francisco and the production was directed by Peter Wagner. The production is made up of six musicians and six singers.   When she completed writing the text and shared it with the theatre company she works with, the producer envisioned the text as an opera rather than a traditional play.  “I worked with the idea of a chorus, similar to what is seen in classical Greek drama where the chorus transforms into different characters and scenes,” she explained.  “One minute, they are the sea, the next the phone lines and calls Daphne receives, the chorus is constantly commenting and questioning, embodying the huge net of voices surrounding her murder case. They are the voices blaming her and the voices pushing her for the truth.” The opera first premiered in November and at the opening night in Oberwart, it received a standing ovation and acclaim. Some reviews described the opera as a “complete success” which ""gets under your skin”. The first show on Friday was dedicated in memory of Alexey Navalny, the Russian opposition figure who died in prison on Friday.    ""We had a moment of silence before the production in memory of Navalny, and then an enthusiastic applause from the audience,"" she said. ""Many commented on their shock at hearing the news of Navalny's death and that the show was extra charged with meaning for them."" Tiwald said that while she wanted to showcase Daphne's courage as an investigative journalist, she did not want to portray her as a hero or perfect. ""There is one particular blog post where she describes Michelle Muscat as wearing what looks like a maternity dress when she met with Michelle Obama and I also put that in the show,"" she said.  ""I remember the director telling me that the singers were concerned that this part would undermine her authority, but I believe it is important to portray her as a human being, not as someone who has it all figured out."" She had also met with poet and activist Immanuel Mifsud, who sent her soundbites of the correct pronunciation of names for the production. Her research also included reading Daphne's blog, Times of Malta articles and numerous other articles. ""I found it very refreshing how she did not care, she was so free in her way of writing, during my research I thought I would find her work more formal,"" she said.

"Mediterrane Film Festival will return this year, tourism minister says",Giulia Magri,"A second edition of the Mediterrane Film Festival will be held later this year, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said on Saturday.  His comments come hot on the heels of revelations that British comedian and author David Walliams was paid a whopping €120,000 to host another local event, the Malta Film Awards, in January 2022.  The Mediterrane Film Festival, which Walliams also hosted for an as-yet undisclosed fee, saw actors and producers flown to Malta and treated to a black-tie gala film awards event at Fort Manoel. Top industry insiders told Times of Malta that the extravagant event cost taxpayers more than a million euros.  Earlier this week, Bartolo said the financial details of last year's Mediterrane Film Festival will be published “in the coming days”.  Bartolo told radio show host Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103 that another Mediterrane Film Festival will take place later this year and more details will be released in due course.  On Friday the Mediterrane Film Festival Facebook page was updated with a new cover image and details, announcing that this year's festival will take place between 22 and 30 June.    Bartolo once again stood by the decision to pay Walliams €120,000 for his Malta Film Awards gig, saying that the comedian helped boost the Maltese film industry. The minister also indicated that, apart from his fee, Maltese taxpayers also paid for all of Walliams' expenses.  There was a separate budget exclusively for his costs, the minister said.  The comedian’s paycheck was only revealed after a two-year legal battle that ended last month after a judge ordered the Malta Film Commission to reveal how much it paid him.   RELATED STORIES  Bartolo argued that the government was bound by a confidentiality clause in its deal with Walliams, who was reportedly “not pleased” that his hosting fee was made public.  He said bringing big blockbusters and producing such festivals brings more money that is being spent.  When asked if another €120,000 will be spent on a new presenter for the festival, Bartolo replied: “We will spend what is needed. The industry is growing.” When asked to ensure the next host was “someone better than Walliams”, Bartolo asked Azzopardi if he approved of British actor Rowan Atkinson, best known for his roles as Mr Bean and Johnny English.    “Much better, yes he is much better,” Azzopardi replied. Bartolo grinned and nodded.  ""But I still wouldn't give him (Atkinson) €120,000, let's be clear,"" Azzopardi replied. ""Double the wage of our Prime Minister, come on..."" According to reports, Atkinson is set to commence filming the fourth instalment of Johnny English in Malta and the UK in June.

"Speak with respect and listen with humility, bishops urge politicians",Times of Malta,"Malta’s bishops have urged politicians to speak respectfully and hear out their opponents in the run-up to June’s local council and European Parliament elections. In a pastoral letter for Lent, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, Gozo Bishop Anton Teuma and Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Galea-Curmi noted that Malta must “urgently rediscover the art of respectful dialogue”. “Sometimes, we tend to prefer people who drown out the voices of others through verbal attacks, ridicule and hurtful language. Yet the quality of political debate is invariably poorer when we engage with each other in this manner. With such negative attitudes, the common good can never be served and we will certainly never achieve unity,” the bishops said. “As the country gears up for local council and European Parliament elections, we encourage all who are involved in public and political life not to shy away from courageously choosing to listen humbly and engaging in respectful dialogue.” The pastoral letter, which will be read out in churches across the country this week, drew inspiration from the national anthem penned by Dun Karm Psaila and the five values its lyrics encourage:  sound judgement, mercy, health, unity and peace. Bishops noted that wisdom means setting aside self-interest in decision making and taking decisions that keep everyone in mind. “We need these types of leaders and citizens for our fine words regarding sustainability and inclusion to mean anything,” they said. People must also be merciful, they said, looking for that which they share with others “rather than judging, condemning, and destroying others on media and social media.”   They encouraged Christians to confess their sins during Lent, allowing them to “encounter the source of mercy.” Bishops noted that health encompasses all its forms – physical, mental and spiritual. Christians must make room for Jesus in their hearts, so that they can be healed, they said. Bishops also noted that people can do their bit to help heal those around them. “There may be a colleague going through a tough time; a neighbour whose health has deteriorated; and a mother or father who have lost their job. Stopping to notice, listen, speak to and accompany someone who is suffering could be the greatest gift of charity during this period of Lent,” they said. Bishops concluded by urging Catholics to take heart, despite the violence in conflicts in the world today. “Nations’ leaders are the ones endowed with the power and responsibility to stop this absurd destruction,” they said. “Nevertheless, we are also called to be bringers of peace. Peace or violence between us depend on the decisions—big or small—that we take each day. Peace is the fruit of good, responsible decisions. When we ignore truth and justice, when we think we are always right, and when success and money become our idols, we sow the seed of violence.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Police Force and Heritage Malta pen deal to improve police museum,Times of Malta,"Heritage Malta will be helping the Malta Police Force to develop and run its museum in Floriana, after the two organisations signed a pledge to collaborate over the next five years. The memorandum of understanding was signed at Fort St Elmo by Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà and Heritage Malta CEO Noel Zammit. A key aim of the MOU is to provide the police with expert assistance in renovating the police museum at police HQ in Floriana. Heritage Malta experts will help the police renovate the museum and provide guidance on how to best present exhibits and run the facility. The police and Heritage Malta will also be organising joint public activities to help the police educate the public about its long history, as well as about the importance of cultural heritage. The deal was announced by the police force in a statement on Saturday morning. Police commissioner Gafà noted that the agreement coincides with the police force’s 120th anniversary and 70th year at its Floriana headquarters. Heritage Malta CEO Zammit said the MOU further entrenched the very positive relations between the organisation and police force.

‘Please call the police’: environmentalist live-streams Siġġiewi ‘ambush',James Cummings,"A member of an environmental protection group was forced to lock himself in his car after he was ""ambushed"" by people in Siġġiewi.  The incident was caught live on camera as the activist - a member of cleanup group 7R Lifestyle Malta - live-streamed the event to Facebook as it unfolded.  One man could be seen hitting his car and the activist said another had approached it, with him in it, with a rock in hand. A woman could also be heard and seen yelling at the man, as he urged live stream viewers to help him by contacting the police.   The activist said that he went to the area on the outskirts of Siġġiewi to meet a woman who asked to meet to discuss allegations of illegal dumping that 7R Lifestyle Malta had publicised on social media.  ""When I got here, she lured me into this lane and suddenly I was blocked off by a truck,"" the man said on the live stream.     “I am in a public road, and they have blocked me completely.” he said.   “They are keeping me here illegally. Please, please, if you can, call the police. Things are escalating, please, someone come now,” he pleaded.   “Look at the situation we are in.... This is all live, to show what sort of country we are... When you care about the environment you are stuck in this situation.”  The incident happened at around 8am, with the police attending the scene shortly afterwards.   When contacted, a police spokesperson said officers had attended the scene and ordered the vehicles blocking the road to be moved.   All people involved had been taken to the police station in Żebbuġ for questioning and investigations were ongoing, the spokesperson said. 7R Lifestyle Malta is a conservation group that works with the Malta Rangers Unit (MRU) to highlight illegal dumping in natural areas.   MRU rangers are citizens empowered to document and report environmental crimes and work with law enforcement to prosecute such crimes.  Commenting on the incident, the MUR said it “strongly condemmed” the incident, calling it a “planned ambush.”    “Our rangers have for over a year worked closely with the person behind this cleanup group and he has taken on Goliath in the area of Siġġiewi and reported several sites not following regulations, as well as doing endless amounts of cleanups,” the group said in a post on Facebook.   “Five days ago he reported an animal farm to ERA, as he should after seeing what he saw, and today ... when he comes on site a large milk truck is blocking the road, causing a scenario where he is not able to get out of there.”  The MRU said it would increase its patrols in the area following the incident.

"Nurses now say they earn a fair salary, says PM",Daniel Ellul,"Prime Minister Robert Abela has pointed to a new collective agreement for nurses as a key part of the government's plan to fix a staffing crisis in the profession.  Abela said the government had agreed to salary increases as part of that deal because it wants to entice graduates to opt for a career within the healthcare profession.    “The increases we gave were not haphazard [ones],"" he said, acknowledging that nurses are in short supply. ""We decided that to incentivise more students to enter the nursing course, we needed to provide better working conditions and pay.""   Nurses now say they are fairly paid, Abela added.  The prime minister was reacting to a Times of Malta article which revealed that the number of graduate nurses last year was the lowest in a decade.  University of Malta data shows that only 83 students qualified in the much-needed profession in 2023. In 2022, 149 new nurses graduated.   Fewer than half of the new graduates moved on to work with the government, where there is a chronic staff shortage. About 20 went on to study medicine. The collective agreement which Abela was referring to was signed in September and impacts nurses, midwives and ESG technicians.  Neither the government nor the nurses' union has published details of the deal, though Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses president Paul Pace has said pay would increase by between €4,000 and €6,000 annually under the new sectoral agreement.

Radio station RTK103 takes Broadcasting Authority to court over Lowell fine,Matthew Xuereb,"Radio station RTK103 on Friday filed proceedings in court to annul a Broadcasting Authority fine over comments made by show host Andrew Azzopardi about far-right candidate Norman Lowell. Azzopardi had described far-right candidate Norman Lowell as racist and said he would never allow him as a guest onto his show. Lowell’s party Imperium Europa subsequently filed a complaint with the BA, which concluded that Azzopardi was guilty of unfair and unjust treatment and fined RTK103 €6,410. Of that fine, €1,750 was for Azzopardi’s comments and €4,660 was for an unrelated incident concerning the radio show host which the BA had previously suspended. In an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court against the Broadcasting Authority and its Chief Executive Joanna Spiteri, the board of directors of RTK103’s parent company, Beacon Media Group chairman Franco Curmi and editor Kevin Papagiorcopulo asked the court to nullify all proceedings and decisions taken by the defendants arising from Azzopardi’s on-air declaration. The radio station argued that that the complainant and the alleged victim were not the same person. They pointed out that the BA’s chief executive had declared that the fine had been imposed because Azzopardi’s declaration was “threatening towards the Authority,” while the party claiming to have suffered harm was Norman Lowell, and not the BA. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli also pointed out that the complaint had not been filed by Lowell, but by Imperium Ewropa, which Azzopardi had not mentioned in the sanctioned remark. They also complained that instead of investigating Imperium Ewropa’s complaint, the BA had decided to proceed with a case against the station and issued charges to this effect. In doing so, Spiteri had failed to observe the principles of natural justice as well as mandatory procedural requirements, which rendered the administrative action an abuse of the Chief Executive’s powers.  They also told the court that the charges were issued against RTK103, which had no juridical personality or legal standing, and that the subsidiary legislation on which the proceedings were meant to have been based, did not even exist. The lawyers also contested the composition of the BA board that heard its case, accusing it of being the judge, jury, and executioner. The BA’s CEO, Spiteri, had effectively prosecuted the case despite also being a witness in it, given she was being interviewed by Azzopardi when he made the remarks. This, they said, breached the most basic principle - that of not deciding on its own case. The BA board secretary, Adriano Spiteri, was previously an active member of Imperium Ewropa – something the complainants said the BA was aware of. Spiteri had brushed this off by saying that he was no longer a member, the complainants said. The lawyers also noted that the BA had fined the station and host for having posed a hypothetical scenario that did not take place. The BA had selectively quoted from Azzopardi’s words in its charges and omitted a sentence that clearly showed that he was asking about a scenario on the BA’s directives which are not yet in place. They also pointed out that Lowell was convicted of inciting racial hatred by a court of appeal and that a separate court had also concluded that any reasonable reader could derive racism, xenophobia and hatred from the far-right candidate’s political messages. Azzopardi’s comment was based on value judgment and the BA’s decision breached his freedom of expression.  RELATED STORIES  Moreover, the BA had in the past fined TV stations that hosted Lowell, while it was now insisting that he should be hosted on Azzopardi’s show. While also complaining that the fine was exorbitant, the radio station called on the court to annul the BA’s decision and declare that the authority and its CEO had acted in bad faith.

Developers and architects join forces in new building council,Daniel Ellul,"Developers and architects have joined forces to lobby the government jointly, in a bid to increase standards within the construction industry.  Kamra tal-Periti (KTP) president Andre Pizzuto and the Malta Developers Association (MDA) president Michael Stivala signed into force the National Building Council on Friday.  “We did this because of the damage happening to the industry's reputation and the negative opinion people have developed towards the industry in the last years,” Pizzuto said.  “We create the space where people live, work, spend their free time and relax; it is a duty of all the stakeholders that what they create is of the highest quality,” he said.  The KPT head said last week’s incident in Gżira shows why standards need to improve.  He was referring to the collapse of a facade and scaffolding at a construction site which narrowly missed passers-by. The collapse, which is being investigated by multiple authorities, is believed to have been caused by tremors caused during excavation works.  Pizzuto said the Building and Construction Authority, set up as a sectoral regulator some years ago, had created more bureaucracy, without leading to more safety in the industry.  Asked to elaborate on the issue, Pizzuto said: “The BCA does go on site when there are reports, but the industry will not just improve with enforcement alone.  “Enforcement is a small part of what is needed. What we need are higher standards and better training,” he said.   RELATED STORIES  He said the industry needs to regulate itself as a result.  “The solution in the present and maybe even in the future is more effort on self-regulation; we need to set higher standards,” he said. MDA president Michael Stivala said developers and KTP had worked together to lobby the government to introduce a new requirement for all new buildings in Gozo to have a limestone façade. He listed some of the new building council's priorities: constructing more environmentally friendly buildings, improving standards to protect third parties during construction, providing more education and training for workers and making sure the quality of construction materials are up to standard.  He said the National Building Council is open to welcoming other associations in the industry. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Duo to face criminal charges after being caught with 12 cannabis plants at home,Times of Malta,"Two people are to face criminal charges after police caught them red-handed with around 12 cannabis plants. The two – a 40-year-old Cospicua man and 24-year-old Fgura woman – were caught with a dozen plants at a residence on Triq San Tumas in Fgura on Thursday evening. Police officers who searched the residence also found various glass jars filled with sachets of suspected cannabis, as well as other items related to drug trafficking. Officers then searched a farm belonging to the man in Triq Wied il- Għajn, Żejtun and found five more cannabis plants there. The woman was also caught with a sachet of suspected cocaine. Magistrate Ian Farrugia is leading an inquiry into the case. The two suspects are being held at police headquarters in Floriana and will be arraigned later on Friday before Magistrate Monica Vella, the police said in a statement.

Abela and Grech met to discuss Malta's next president this week,Daniel Ellul,"Robert Abela and Bernard Grech met this week to discuss who will be Malta’s next President, sources close to the talks said.  The two party leaders must agree on a name to succeed George Vella, as new constitutional rules adopted in 2020 mean the appointment of the president requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.  Vella's five-year term ends on April 1 and cannot be renewed. The government can, however, nominate an acting president until agreement is reached on a successor. Prior to the constitutional changes, presidents were elected by a simple majority of MPs after being proposed by the government. That effectively meant that the ruling party could nominate someone without needing to consult with the other side of the House.   Prime Minister Abela has said he is convinced the government and Opposition can find a nominee they agree upon. But Abela tempered that by also noting that the ""sovereignty of the majority"" also had to be taken into account. On the doorstep of parliament last month, Opposition leader Grech said he hoped that talks would lead to a choice that unites the country.  The President of Malta is a largely ceremonial role. But a president's signature is the final step in the legislative process, and no law can come into force without it.  While a president has never blocked a law by refusing to sign it, the country is believed to have come close to such a crisis situation during Vella's tenure.  The current president reportedly told his inner circle that he was prepared to resign if an abortion law that would have allowed the termination of a pregnancy when a woman’s health is at risk was passed through parliament.  The government paused that bill for several months and subsequently amended it to allow termination only when the woman’s life is at risk.  Vella signed the bill in July.

Suspended sentence for man who beat wife with electric cord and plug,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who beat his estranged wife with a fridge’s electric cable while their seven-year-old son looked on has been handed a suspended sentence. Magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled that the actions of the 42-year-old Mosta resident, whose name is not being published to protect the identity of the victim and the minor, were not tolerable in society.   The incident happened in February 2022 when the man repeatedly hit the woman with the cable and plug. She suffered injuries to her face, back, torso and arms. He told the court that he was in the process of separating from his wife and claimed she was seeing someone else. The woman denied this claim. She told the court she was in bed with her son when she suddenly heard noises coming from downstairs.  When she went down, she saw her husband smashing things on the ground. He then proceeded upstairs and woke up their son, to ask him where his mother was going in the evenings.  When they went downstairs, despite her efforts to leave their son alone, he pushed her onto the sofa, grabbed a wire with a plug at its end and began hitting her with it. She told the court the boy was shaking with fear. She managed to call the police, who arrived in no time. Her father, who lived with the couple, was watching television downstairs at the time of the incident. He told the police that he saw his daughter's estranged husband throwing things out of the fridge onto the ground, then storm upstairs. He heard his daughter screaming and then witnessed the violence downstairs, as he tried to leave the house with his young grandson. His daughter ended up with a black eye, he said. During his interrogation, the man said that he around three weeks before the incident, he received a letter from his wife’s lawyer, requesting a separation. He said he worked long hours for his family to live comfortably but refused to reply to any questions related to the incident. In her judgment, Magistrate Montebello ruled that there was no evidence of any provocation and there was no explanation for his violent actions. Such aggressive and violent behaviour has no place in society, should not be tolerated and deserves a suitable punishment that serves as a deterrent, the magistrate said. The message had to get through that violence against women, as well as any violence in a domestic unit, is deplorable and should be severely condemned, the magistrate said. She therefore condemned him to nine months in jail suspended for two years, ordered him to pay €525 in court expenses and issued a protection order in favour of the woman. Police inspector Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted. Defence lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb represented the accused.

"Woman tricked into accepting social benefits by Labour official, court told",Matthew Xuereb,"A woman who says she was tricked by a Labour Party official into accepting social benefits she was not entitled to ended up taking out a loan to pay back the amount, a court heard on Friday. The 63-year-old woman appeared before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech charged with having accepted around €15,000 in social benefits she was not entitled to in 2020. She is one of hundreds of people investigated for having taken part in a massive benefits scam that was made public by Times of Malta last year. Her lawyer, Jason Azzopardi, told the court that the Tarxien woman had been approached by a Labour Party representative during a political activity in Paola. The party representative, who was dressed in a suit and tie, approached the woman close to the church of Christ the King as she walked along Triq Guże D'Amato in Paola. A Labour Party political activity was underway in the square at the time. Azzopardi told the court that the suited man asked her whether she suffered from any illnesses and whether she needed any assistance. When she told him that she had been battling major depression for many years, the man told her “we’re going to help you.” He then handed her a form, asked her to sign it, and told her to leave the rest to the Labour Party, because they were there to help people. A few days later, the woman was called to appear before a medical board. Following a “three-minute interview”, the woman was informed that she was eligible for benefits. She was told that she would start receiving payments soon, which she did. Azzopardi told the court that his client was intellectually challenged and a “victim of her circumstances”. When she learnt that she was not entitled to the money she was receiving, she took out a €10,000 loan to pay back the amount she had been tricked into accepting, her lawyer argued. The woman pleaded guilty to the charges brought against her, saying that she thought she was truly eligible for the extra payments.  RELATED STORIES  In submissions on punishment, Azzopardi asked the court to examine this case closely, insisting that the woman had been misled and tricked into accepting something for which she was not entitled. He said a suspended sentence, together with a probation or community service order was more than enough in the circumstances. Magistrate Frendo Dimech put off the case to April 23 for sentencing. Police Inspector Andy Rotin prosecuted. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

‘Don’t fund corruption’: Greens in latest call for gas pipeline to be scrapped,Times of Malta,"MEPs from the Green political grouping have again warned against the EU backing plans for a gas pipeline that critics argue will financially benefit murder suspect Yorgen Fenech. In a draft motion for a resolution before the European Parliament’s energy committee, the MEPs argued that power station company Electrogas will receive €85 million in “compensation” if the pipeline is built. Electrogas currently supplies LNG for the island’s power grid via a floating storage unit moored in Delimara. The Greens emphasised how Fenech, an Electrogas shareholder, has been charged with complicity in journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder. He denies the charges. The resolution further detailed how Caruana Galizia was investigating a large cache of Electrogas documents before her assassination in October 2017. Greens said “when and if” the Melita TransGas is commissioned, Malta will be locked into a dirty fossil fuel future for decades to come. Last year, NGO Friends of the Earth joined calls for the government to scrap the pipeline plans, and instead focus on renewable energies. In their recommendations, the FOE said that plans for the pipeline should be suspended and the roughly €400 million in taxpayer money should instead be invested in the production of renewable energy to speed up the country’s green transition. “The proposed Melita TransGas pipeline would lock Malta in a fossil fuel future and signify a climate-incompatible investment, leading to stranded assets,” they said. The construction of the pipeline would also have an impact on the posidonia beds around Delimara. The seagrass, they said, is capable of capturing up to 15 times the amount of carbon dioxide that a rainforest is capable of and that this should be protected as a carbon sink, rather than be destroyed by the infrastructure required for the pipeline. The government has argued that the pipeline will be “hydrogen-ready,” and is essential for diversifying Malta’s energy mix.

Public consultation finds mixed reaction on cigarette perma-ban,Giulia Magri,"A proposal to discuss a ban on cigarette sales to people born after a certain date received mixed reactions in a public consultation exercise. The measure was proposed in a public consultation document for the ""Children’s Policy Framework 2024-2030"", published by the Children's Rights Ministry in November. It says: “Initiate discussions at the national level to ban cigarette sales to individuals born after a due date agreed by stakeholders. This will positively impact the health of all future generations.” Revealing the results of the consultation on Friday, discussion on the ban made for more than 10% of the submissions received. Ministry director-general Alexia Vella said the reactions to the potential ban were mixed.   ""Overall, there was no opposition to holding future discussions on the ban,"" she added.  “There were those who were in favour of the ban, even adding that there should also be a ban on vapes and cigarette machines. Some were against it, arguing that it could lead to the illegal purchase of cigarettes.” Earlier in February, the Health Minister raised concerns about how easily accessible vapes are to children.    “It is good to have a discussion, and whatever the decision, this should be in the best interest of children,” Children’s Minister Micheal Falzon said.  When asked if he believed the sale of vapes should be banned, Falzon said that there is currently a discussion on whether these were more harmful than actual cigarettes.  “If they are harmful, they should be banned for all, not just children,” he said. “I might be a bit prejudiced on this one, I never had a puff of a cigarette in my life. I do not believe in imposing bans, but I believe we should look after our health.” The 35 submissions received included contributions from 10 ministries and entities, seven NGOs, and 15 individuals.  Apart from the discussion on cigarette bans, they also tackled other topics, such as education services, children’s rights and children’s mental health.  One proposal called for greater emphasis on digital education and media ethics, along with more school activities involving parent participation.  There were also calls for sex education to be focused on the health aspect, and to strengthen home therapy services for children.  Submissions also included calls for more trained social workers and psychologists as well as enhanced psychosocial services in schools.  Children were also able to voice their opinions and suggestions through a web application.  The consultation document received 204 submissions from children, who sent images, drawings and text messages with their opinions on how to improve child well-being.   According to the results, 11.4% highlighted the importance of the environment, and another 11% that of quality time and family.  The age of respondents was between three and 17 years, with the majority (40%) of submissions being filed by nine to 11-year-olds.  The ministry will now evaluate the feedback received and finalise the policy paper, to be published later this year.

Musical CEO chairs: Mark Mallia appointed Transport Malta boss,Times of Malta,"Updated 6pm with PN statement Colonel Mark Mallia was appointed head of Transport Malta on Friday, less than two weeks after it was announced he would take over as chief executive of the Foundation for Medical Services. Mallia's appointment was confirmed on Friday afternoon by the Transport Ministry, which said he would assume the role ""with immediate effect"".  The news suggests an abrupt change of direction for the government: on February 2, the health ministry had announced that Mallia would be taking over from Carmen Ciantar as head of the Foundation for Medical Servies. It is not yet clear who will now assume the top FMS role.  According to political sources, several other people had been offered the transport authority top job over the last few days but had turned down the ""toxic role"".  Last weekend, Times of Malta revealed Transport Malta CEO Jonathan Borg was removed from his post, less than a year after being appointed to the role, taking over from Brigadier Jeffrey Curmi at the end of April 2023. That appointment had followed weeks of speculation that the former commander of the Armed Forces had stepped down from the role.  Contacted on Friday, Transport Minister Chris Bonett would not confirm or deny Mallia's appointment.  But his ministry later made it official in a statement which stated that the former transport regulator, Borg, had his resignation accepted by the minister. Bonnett took over the transport ministry last month. It is standard practice for all heads of state entities to offer their resignation whenever there is a change of minister.  In the ministry statement, Bonett said he thanked Borg for his work and wished Mallia all the best in his new job.  Mallia is an army colonel with a degree in law and business management. He was previously aide de camp to former President George Abela, the prime minister's father. He leaves his job at CEO of state entity Identità (previously Identity Malta) to take over Transport Malta. Identità will now be led by Steve Agius, who previously served as Chief Operating Officer at Mater Dei Hospital.  Mallia will be Transport Malta's third CEO in less two years, given Borg lasted less than a year in a job. Borg's predecessor, Jeffrey Curmi, had also lasted less than a year in the role. Transport Malta has been embroiled in a wide-reaching driving licence racket, with evidence showing that former transport minister Ian Borg and his ministry staff fed names to Transport Malta’s licensing director and piled on the pressure for candidates to pass their practical driving test.  Clint Mansueto and two low-level Transport Malta clerks, Philip Edrick Zammit and Raul Antonio Pace, have been accused of corruption and trading in influence in connection with the racket. They deny the charges. The Nationalist Party has also claimed to have evidence that Transport Malta employees were being asked to meddle with fines and contraventions and lie about it under oath.  Reacting to Mallia’s appointment, the Nationalist Party said Mallia’s sudden switch to Transport Malta just one week into his new job was a sign of the government’s state of confusion. “We hope Colonel Mallia will ensure that the full truth about Transport Malta rackets emerges, but it is also disappointing to see the health sector being left to languish,” PN MPs Mark Anthony Sammut, Adrian Delia and Ivan Castillo said in a statement.

Applicant does not convince court of human rights breach,Matthew Xuereb,"A judge has thrown out a breach of human rights claim by a businessman over a fine imposed when he failed to declare that he was taking more than €160,000 in cash out of Malta. Presiding over the court of constitutional jurisdiction, Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey ruled that Ali Muuse Igaale from Somalia, who also holds Sudanese and Maltese passports, had failed to convince the court that his rights had been breached and had also failed to back up his claims. Igaale had been arrested at the airport in August 2021, after a sniffer dog indicated that his luggage contained something potentially illegal. A subsequent search led to the discovery of the undeclared cash in his suitcase. He was charged with tax evasion and breaching Malta’s Cash Control Regulations which lay down that travellers must declare all amounts of cash over €10,000 to customs upon arrival or departure from Malta. The rules state that failure to do so will result in the confiscation of the amounts over €10,000, as well as a fine equivalent to 25% of the total amount of undeclared cash. He had been condemned to pay a fine of €85,601.40 and subsequently filed a constitutional case arguing that the punishment constituted a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. He described the fine as disproportionate and arbitrary. Moreover, no evidence had been submitted that showed the money had originated from illegal activity, his lawyers argued. But Mr Justice Spiteri Bailey ruled that Igaale had not provided any evidence to back up his claim of a breach of his human rights and neither did he provide any facts which could have supported a mitigated punishment. He said Igaale was well aware of the punishment that would be inflicted when he freely admitted to the charges brought against him, confirming his admission of guilt after having been told of the consequences. Igaale had been assisted by a lawyer and an interpreter at the time he filed the guilty plea. The judge said he knew what punishment his admission would lead to. “The punishment meted out to Igaale can be said to have also been his choice, in the sense that he had freely chosen to admit the charges and consequently be punished with that fine,” the judge ruled as he threw out the case. Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi, Francesca Zarb and Jacob Magri assisted Igaale. Lawyers Julian Farrugia and Rachel Aquilina represented the police.

Four plots to be developed into public parks,Daniel Ellul,"The Lands Authority will be transferring four open spaces in Luqa, Kirkop, Lija and St Julian’s to Project Green, which will be responsible for turning them into public parks. Prime Minister Robert Abela announced the plans as he stood beside one of the vacant plots at Ta' Ġiorni in St Julian's. This particular plot is 2,300 square metres. He said 30 apartment blocks could have been built in the space, which has a combined value of €20 million.     Having open spaces in town centres where people can relax is among the Labour government’s goals, Abela said.  Lands minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi said the four tracts of lands measured  a total of 8,000 square metres - one-and-a-half football pitches.  Instead of just looking at the economic value of the land, the government is prioritising communities' quality of life, Abela said. Environment Minister Miriam Dalli said the new public gardens will not include many buildings or structures and trees already present in some of the sites will be incorporated into the project. Fielding questions, Abela said local plans did not give landowners an automatic right to develop.  These offered the Planning Authority guidance when it came to granting permits. They determined what and where new structures could be built. Amending them, he said, would mean “removing the carpet from underneath every person who owns a plot of land in this country”. In doing so, it would create a great injustice with these owners. “It would create market instability and it would break people economically,"" he said.   Abela said landowners come in all forms in Malta and were not just limited to rich developers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Appeals board turns down complaints on Comino project EIA,Matthew Xuereb,"A planning tribunal has turned down an appeal by four NGOs over the environmental impact assessment that led the Environment and Resources Authority to give its green light to the proposed Comino project. The Environment and Planning Review Tribunal threw out all but one of the grounds of appeal put forward by Din l-Art Ħelwa, Moviment Graffitti, Birdlife Malta and Friends of the Earth Malta over the findings of the project’s EIA. It therefore confirms the decision taken by the environment watchdog in July 2022 when it gave the project the green light. The tribunal only accepted one complaint regarding the proposed removal of the public toilets in Santa Marija Bay. It ordered that one of the conditions imposed by ERA should be amended to include an obligation to have a concrete alternative proposal for these facilities.  RELATED STORIES  The project’s developer, HV Hospitality, welcomed the decision saying it confirmed that the environmental studies carried out on the project were exhaustive and correct. HV Hospitality is a subsidiary of Hili Ventures. The developers are planning a luxury resort in Comino, with proposed bungalows within the existing footprint. They had previously filed a planning application seeking to redevelop the existing hotel and bungalows in the area of San Niklaw and Santa Marija Bay but its downsized plans for the site will see an overall reduction of 8,244 square metres in the project’s built footprint. The bungalows will replace an existing development at Santa Marija Bay while the hotel will replace the old hotel at San Niklaw Bay. They will be managed by the Six Senses brand. The buildings at the bungalow site will be receded from the foreshore, increasing public accessibility, and will be lower in height. In their appeal, the eNGOs complained that the EIA left out important aspects of the proposed development and that will be detrimental to the environment. Among others, they claimed that the proposed change in use of the bungalows from a tourism accommodation complex that operates for part of the year to a permanent residential complex sees the potential for a substantial increase in the permanent residential population on the island, significantly increasing the risk.  RELATED STORIES  They complained that the EIA had overlooked alternatives for the proposed development and that the EIA consultant had failed to take into consideration feedback from the public. They said the assessment had also failed to consider the negative effect the development would have on the marine environment. However, the appeals tribunal shot down their complaints, including one on the removal of trees, saying the report had recommended an extensive landscaping exercise. It noted that of the 380 trees that will be removed, only 60 of them cannot be transplanted elsewhere. Regarding noise that could disturb birds, the tribunal noted that the EIA found that noise levels could potentially be of no significance to minor significance. The assessment predicts that noise reaching the bird populations from outdoor entertainment activity was of no significance. Commenting on another complaint regarding the proposed spa facilities, which will be open to the public, the tribunal noted that the spa will be replacing the space presently occupied by tennis courts. The tribunal, therefore, confirmed ERA’s decision to greenlight the project and threw out the NGO’s complaints on the environmental process.

Planning Authority officers assaulted at Ta' Qali,Times of Malta,"Two Planning Authority officers were assaulted at Ta' Qali on Thursday while carrying out compliance and enforcement duties. The officers were threatened and physically assaulted by an individual, the PA said in a statement.  Transport Malta officials, who were conducting patrols in the area at the time, intervened promptly to halt the aggressor and prevent further consequences. An ambulance was sent to the site as one of the PA officers was suffering from shock and needed medical treatment. Police officers were also called on site and took statements from all parties involved. The aggressor is expected to be charged in court in the coming days. The authority expressed solidarity and support with its officers and unreservedly condemned any form of harassment or abuse directed towards public officials performing their duties.

Full time employment up 8%,Times of Malta,"Registered full-time employment in September increased by 8% compared to a year earlier, while part-time employment as a primary job increased by 3.5%, the National Statistics Office said. According to administrative data provided by Jobsplus, the labour supply (excluding part-timers), increased by 8% over one year, reaching 278,677. This was mainly attributed to a year-on-year increase in full-time registered employment (20,549) and an increase in registered unemployment (49). Administrative and support service activities and accommodation and food service activities contributed mostly to the increase in employment. Registered full-time employment in the private sector went up by 20,342 to reach 226,221. Public sector full-time employment increased by 207 to reach 51,452.  The number of people registered as full-time self-employed rose by 726, while the number of people registered as employees increased by 19,823. Full-time employment for males and females went up by 8.4% and 7.3%, respectively over 2022 levels.   Registered part-time employment in September increased by 6.3% when compared to the corresponding month in 2022.  The number of part-timers who also held a full-time job amounted to 41,134 up by 8.7%.

Part of Burmarrad Road to be closed from Monday,Times of Malta,"Part of Naxxar’s Burmarrad Road, close to It-Telgħa t’Alla u Ommu, will be closed to traffic from Monday as Enemalta lays down underground cables. Through a Facebook post, the corporation said part of the busy road will be closed for a few weeks during the works.    It urged motorists to use alternative routes through nearby roads as indicated in the map above. Access to the road's commercial and agricultural areas will remain open.  It is yet another potential headache for motorists after the road was only reopened to traffic in June after the completion of the first phase of a water system upgrade.

Could an expert board solve the problem of ADHD medication fringe cases?,Claudia Calleja,"Updated 3.35pm with Commissioner for Health endorsement Patients who need ADHD medication that is not offered through the government formulary, and suffer mental health repercussions could soon have an alternative.  The plan is to introduce an expert board that will review such requests on a case-by-case basis. Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said he would like the board of experts within the psychiatry and psychology fields to assess potential outliers, study the response to the various drugs and then make a recommendation. The government would then reimburse a set fixed price agreed between the pharma industry and the Medicines Authority, he said. Last month, Times of Malta reported how a mother with ADHD has no option but to give her own branded medication to her teenage son, who has the same condition but no free access to the drug. A psychiatrist recommended both Rachel Spiteri and her 18-year-old son to take Concerta, a branded version of methylphenidate, to treat the neurodevelopmental disorder.   But whereas Spiteri gets the branded drug free through the Pharmacy of Your Choice (POYC) scheme, the cost of her son’s medication is at least €130 a month. She spoke out in the hope the government resolves the issue that has been going on for four years despite the Ombudsman finding in her favour and the recommendations of a UK specialist. Replying to a parliamentary question, Abela announced the setting up of the board in reply to a question by Nationalist MP Charles Azzopardi. When contacted, Abela said every medication has a bell-curve response in the population. “It will work well in most, not at all in some, and way too much in a few. Full responders to generics or originators are not at issue. The outliers, however, pose a problem because treatment has to be fine-tuned and treatment can be both costly and logistically prob­lema­tic due to economy of scale.” The plan was welcomed by Commissioner for Health Ray Galea. Galea, whose office forms part of the Office of the Ombudsman, noted that he had called for a similar structure in a final opinion of an investigation into a complaint back in May 2023 Pamela Muscat, president of ADHD Malta, welcomed the initiative and hopes it will take immediate effect, and that pro-active action and patient representatives will be part of it, not just professionals. She added that patient representatives should be consulted on such delicate matters and kept informed about out-of-stock and replacement medication. The ADHD issue dates back to 2018 when the tender for the branded drug Concerta expired, and since then, Xenidate and other generic versions, which are a lower cost to the health service, have been offered instead. According to policy, only those who were on Concerta before the tender expired are entitled to get it for free under POYC. Some ADHD sufferers reported their condition had regressed. Psychiatrists warned that changes in medication provided by the government were having a detrimental effect on children and adults. The side effects were having an impact on sleeping patterns, appetite, aggression and anxiety, among others. That was when the government commissioned a UK expert to look into the matter and decided that previous Concerta patients would be given the medicine. The expert doctor Ramzi Nasir, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, concluded that, while not all patients warranted a return to Concerta, this should be a clinical decision made jointly by the clinical physician and the patient. ADHD is the most diagnosed mental disorder in children and is characterised by, among other things, difficulty in sustaining attention and emotion regulation, excessive activity and difficulty in controlling behaviour. Concerta, Xenidate and the generics that followed are long-acting drugs that essentially do the same thing. They contain the stimulant methylphenidate which works by releasing neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) called norepinephrine and dopamine into the brain. Increasing these neurotransmitter levels helps to stimulate the brain, which can improve the symptoms of ADHD. Generics are clinically less effective than branded medicines and are effective for a shorter time. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man denies stealing Valletta scaffolding ,Matthew Xuereb,"A man was remanded in custody on Thursday after pleading guilty to the theft of scaffolding from a Valletta construction site.  The police told the court that the man was arrested after he was recognised through CCTV footage of nearby establishments stealing the structure in the dead of the night.  Inspector Gabriel Micallef arraigned Desmond Joseph Agius, 56, from Sliema before Magistrate Ian Farrugia. The inspector said the investigation into the January 3 theft began when a report was filed with the police who then reviewed CCTV footage and recognised Agius.  After an arrest warrant was issued, Agius was arrested and admitted to stealing the structure, explaining that he had sold the metal to a scrapyard as scrap metal. The scaffolding was worth around €1,400. Agius insisted in court on not wanting a lawyer to represent him and pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him. His request to be released on bail was turned down by the court after it heard the prosecution stating that there were civilian witnesses who still had to testify.

EP committee approves Agius Saliba's call to probe food monopolies in Malta,Times of Malta,"A European Parliament committee has accepted MEP Alex Agius Saliba's request to call on the European Commission to investigate monopolies in food retail in Malta.  Cross-party support was obtained at the Petitions Committee to call on the European Commission to investigate whether the mechanisms of de-facto monopolies are leading to artificially higher prices in the food retail sector in Malta. Agius Saliba embarked on the campaign, insisting he was aware of abusive and potentially illegal practices by key players in the sector. Food prices have increased significantly in recent years. While the increase was driven by external shocks such as the pandemic, the Ukraine war and bottlenecks in the supply chain, the inflation seen in Malta goes beyond what was observed elsewhere. The inflation rate of food prices amounted to 10% in Malta in December whereas the EU average amounted to 6%.  Various distributors recently agreed to decrease prices by 15% and freeze them for nine months through a voluntary initiative led by the government.  Malta's geographic realities as a small island with a limited market share coupled with long-standing supply chains, practices and traditions make it ripe for the formation of de-facto monopolies, Agius Saliba said.  The abuse of a dominant position to manipulate the market is a violation of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, also known as the Antitrust rules, and the European Commission is empowered to investigate violations and issue fines. Agius Saliba applauded the EP's endorsement to ensure that key market players are held accountable and charted the way ahead.   The Labour MEP said: “Parliament’s decision is the first tangible step in this struggle. Food retail prices impact all consumers equally irrespective of their spending power.” He said the monopolies have created a situation of price adjustments and controls on multiple brands and products that are directly controlled by importers, and is aggressively protected by killing any parallel importation from smaller traders.

Watch: Farmers gather for second protest in two weeks,Daniel Ellul,"Updated 6.30pm with farmers' demands Tractors from across the country drove from Ta' Qali to Valletta in a protest against EU rules for the second time in two weeks. Carrying placards with messages like 'Take care of us or you'll go hungry', 'No farmers, no food, no future', and 'Farmers gone? Eat your money', they honked horns as they made their way to Valletta, each tractor proudly boasting a Malta flag. Farmers say the EU rules mean there is an unfair playing field for local products, who face competition from imported foods. And they are calling on the government to do more to protect them.   The tractors came from all over - including from Gozo - creating an unusual sight on Gozo Channel vessels.   Tractors and other farming vehicles lined up one after another and drove at a brisk walking pace. The convoy was over 20 minutes long. Farmers passed through some of Malta's busiest roads en route to the Valletta waterfront, driving through the Central Link road, Mrieħel bypass, Marsa-Ħamrun bypass and the Marsa Junction.   When the convoy reached the offices of the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority, some farmers hopped out of their vehicles for a quick detour. After taping signs reading ""we are here to safeguard their food"" and ""no farmers, no food, no future"" to the MCCAA's door, they got back into their tractors and proceeded to Valletta.    The MCCAA is the authority tasked with overseeing the amount of pesticide and fertilizer in Maltese agricultural products. Farmers say the authority should carry out the same checks on products coming from foreign, and especially non-EU, countries.  They also met with Agriculture Minister Anton Refalo, who said he was there in solidarity with the farmers. Shadow Agriculture Minister Toni Bezzina also said he backed the farmers, saying ""it does not make sense to put our country in the same categories as other countries, with much larger resources and land than ours"".   Farmer Joseph Muscat said there had to be more control on products coming from abroad which were sometimes also sold as local. And farmer Marthese Cortiz said the Maltese government had voted against farmers so they had to come out and protest. Farmers are upset with EU trade deals that remove or reduce barriers for non-EU agricultural products.   They are also against state aid rules that limit government support, and EU rules that reward farmers for leaving fields fallow - a technique to allow land to recover - saying this was an incentive to landowners to keep land unproductive. Farmers also say  European legislation intended to make farming more environmentally friendly is being introduced too quickly and without the necessary support.   During Thursday's protest, farmers presented a list of five requests to the government. They say implementing those changes, which range from providing subsidies for things like animal feed to playing hardball with the EU to block imports of non-EU foodstuffs competing directly with local products, would ensure they are not priced out of business.   Earlier in February, Maltese farmers joined their European counterparts in protest at EU regulations they feel undermine their livelihoods.  RELATED STORIES  On Thursday, they are expected to present the Maltese government with five proposals they believe could lessen the blow of their regulations. The Malta protests are organised by the Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi and with the backing of various organisations related to food production.   ""Whilst reiterating the local food producers’ opposition to the European Union’s current framework and future ambitions that are seriously threatening the livelihoods of farmers, the organisation will now be making several proposals to the government to assist in the buffering of the impact of such EU regulations and plans,"" a statement by Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi said. Farmers' lobby president Malcolm Borg said that should the government implement the proposals, food producers would be able to withstand the impact of the new EU rules You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Court allows government to intervene in PN's hospitals case,Matthew Xuereb,"Updated at 4.40pm with Grech comments A court has allowed the government to intervene in a case instituted by the Nationalist Party against the State Advocate in connection with the hospitals concession. Quoting from various case law related to the acceptance of a party to the case, Mr Justice Toni Abela ruled that since the case mentioned two members of the cabinet – Prime Minister Robert Abela and former Health Minister Chris Fearne – the cabinet had a direct judicial interest in the case and was therefore to be admitted as a party. The judge read out his decree in the presence of Abela, home affairs minister Byron Camilleri, Opposition leader Bernard Grech and PN MP Adrian Delia. The case was filed by the Opposition in a bid to recoup the money ""defrauded"" by Steward Healthcare in the hospitals' deal. The 2015 deal that saw the running of three hospitals - St Luke’s, Karin Grech and the Gozo General - passed on to the private sector was annulled by a court last year, and confirmed on appeal. Vitals Global Healthcare initially ran the hospitals and the concession was later taken over by Steward Health Care. The original judgment described the contract as fraudulent while the Appeals Court also founds signs that top government officials had colluded against the national interest.  Grech and Delia last year asked the court to order the State Advocate to take action against “present and past government officials involved in the [hospitals privatisation] deal”.  In his decree on Friday, the judge quoted legal papers, including in the Italian language, that detailed where a party ought to be admitted to a case. Among others, it must be proven that the party requesting to be admitted should have an interest in the entire case and not just over the final result of the case in question. He insisted that justice had to be done with all parties involved in the case. In this case, he said, the opposition was claiming that the government went beyond its powers. The court also delved into the timing of such a request to intervene in a case, saying the local courts always distinguished between cases which were still at their initial stages and those cases which are at their later stages. Since this case was still in its initial phases, the court was allowing the cabinet to intervene as a party. Lawyers Edward DeBono and Nicholas DeBono are representing Grech and Delia.Lawyers James D'Agostino and Julian Farrugia are representing the State Advocate.Lawyers Chris Cilia, Ian Borg and Maurizio Cordina are representing the government and the Cabinet. Instead of joining its court case to try and recoup the €400 million given to Vitals and Steward, the government was now trying to stop it, PN leader Bernard Grech said following the court decision. Grech said the court had chastised the government to stop its continued attack on the judiciary by highlighting the “colourful language” used by the state advocate in a recent court application. “Contrary to what Robert Abela says, the government has repeatedly sought to pressure and attack the judiciary,” Grech said. Grech was accompanied by PN secretary general Michael Piccinino, shadow health minister Adrian Delia and lawyer Edward Debono.

Lydia Abela Xewkija guesthouse gets Planning Authority go-ahead,Neville Borg,"A planning application filed by Lydia Abela, Prime Minister Robert Abela’s wife, to convert a Gozo farmhouse into a guest house was approved earlier this month. The already-built farmhouse, within Xewkija's urban conservation area, is set to become an eight-bedroom guesthouse with a pool, wine cellar and breakfast area. The property spans some 1,910 square metres, including its garden and outdoor areas. The farmhouse’s intended use has also been changed from residential to commercial, indicating that it will be used as a guesthouse once works are completed. In its correspondence with the Planning Authority, the Malta Tourism Authority found “no objection” to the development, granting it a Tourism Policy Compliance Certificate. The property will still need to obtain an operating license to operate as a guesthouse, the authority noted. Minutes from the Planning Authority’s board meeting show that the application was approved unanimously on February 2. The farmhouse has been subject to several planning applications over the years. In 2012, Abela was granted a permit to build a pool in the property’s backyard, but works were never carried out. The permit was renewed in 2017, but, once again, the works did not take place. In January last year, Abela also applied to carry out several alterations to the property, including building a pool and a gym, however, the application was withdrawn weeks later. The property has proven to be a controversial one in recent weeks, with several reports claiming that the Prime Minister had failed to declare the purchase of property in Xewkija publicly. Questions have also been raised over how the property was paid for, with his personal wealth declarations seemingly unchanged from one year to the next. Responding to questions, Abela denied having failed to declare the property, insisting that he paid for it via a cheque and ""not a cent in cash"".

"Four dead in occupational accidents, more than 1,000 injured in six months",Times of Malta,"Four fatal occupational accidents were reported in the last half of 2023, the National Statistics Office said on Thursday. This was three fewer than in the same period a year earlier. The NSO said the number of non-fatal occupational accidents in the same period decreased by 102, or 8.3%, compared to the corresponding period a year earlier. A total 1,127 non-fatal accidents at work were reported in the last six months of 2023. The majority occurred in the manufacturing sector (15.5%). Another 141 or 12.5% occurred in the construction sector followed by the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (136 or 12.1%). One-third of those involved in an accident at work were absent from work for three days or less, while those absent from work for 21 days or more amounted to 18%. The largest share of accidents involved persons working in elementary occupations, followed by craft and related trades workers. A total 27.3% of the accidents involved persons aged between 35 and 44. In the period under review, 73.3% of those involved in a non-fatal accident at work were Maltese. During all of 2023, 740 non-fatal accidents per 100,000 employed persons were reported. The highest standardised incidence rate of non-fatal occupational accidents was recorded in manufacturing followed by construction and transportation and storage.

"Elliot Busuttil admits murder of taxi driver, attempted murder of second man",Matthew Xuereb,"A man has admitted to murdering taxi driver Mario Farrugia, who was found dead in the trunk of his car two years ago, and the attempted murder of a second man, Emil Marinov. Elliot Paul Busuttil, 40, from Attard changed his plea to guilty on Thursday morning and the court was informed that the prosecution and defence had agreed on a 35-year prison sentence. His 62-year-old victim, from Pembroke, was stabbed more than 40 times and then left in the trunk of his car in an Qormi valley, where it was found on April 5, 2022. At the time Busuttil was out on bail for the attempted murder of Bulgarian national Emil Marinov, who was found in Ta' Qali in August 2020, lying on the ground in a pool of blood after also being stabbed multiple times.    Busuttil initially denied both crimes but changed his plea after a deal. On Thursday Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera was informed that the prosecution and defence had agreed on a 35-year prison sentence. The judge said the court was not bound by the plea bargaining agreement.  Defence counsel Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit said the court should respect the agreement because otherwise it would backfire on future plea bargaining agreements.    ""The court has a big backlog and the plea bargaining tool seems to be working. While it is true that the court is not bound by the plea agreement, if the courts do not accept it, it will backfire on future plea bargaining,"" he said.  He added that even though there was a strong defence case, that could have potentially led to his aquittal, his client wanted to plead guilty ""for closure"".  Attorney General lawyer Kevin Valletta told the court that the punishment on which there was agreement was fair, even with society and the victims.   Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta, appearing for Marinov, and Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri, appearing for the Farrugias family, said they agreed with the proposed 35-year jail term. Azzopardi said his client was the victim of an unprovoked aggression. He said they had met to sell a radio and was attacked, suffering a permanent disability and cannot work any longer. The case had raised questions at the time over bail eligibility after Busuttil was able to murder someone whilst out on bail for attempted murder.  Marinov was slashed more than 20 times with a butcher’s cleaver in a horrific frenzy of violence.   Busuttil was charged with that attack and granted bail. Less than two years later, Busuttil was arrested and charged in court again, this time with the gruesome killing of Farrugia, who was stabbled more than 40 times. He was found dead three days after he was reported missing and his body was severely decomposed by the time it was discovered.  Police officers who were alerted to the vehicle parked at Qormi valley, had told the court at previous sittings about the “strange smell…like some dead animal,” and the buzzing flies that struck them as they circled the car. Sources had said that Farrugia and Busuttil knew each other, with the former seen driving the latter around in the Peugeot 407 car his body was eventually found inside. There was speculation that the crime may have been sparked by a financial dispute between the two.  His brother Joe testified in an earlier sitting how, shortly before his disappearance, Mario had voiced concern about two clients who would not pay him the agreed amount for his taxi services. He was trying to offload them, telling his brother that he believed that the pair “were involved in drugs.” The case has been deferred for judgment on March 5.

Malta abortion helpline gets at least one call a day - doctor,Sarah Carabott,"Every day, at least one person calls a Maltese helpline set up by pro-choice doctors asking for information on how to carry out a safe abortion, a Brussels event about women’s sexual health was told on Wednesday. “My colleagues and I receive calls on our abortion doula support service helpline once or twice a day from people seeking information before, during or after an abortion.  RELATED STORIES  ""We provide information – something that is not illegal – on how to safely get an abortion in Malta,” gynaecologist Isabelle Stabile told a group of activists and MEPs. The event, coordinated by Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer, saw the screening of No Woman is an Island (Nexus Productions), and a discussion that included European MEPs, gender equality activist Marceline Naudi, Women’s Rights Foundation director Lara Dimitrijevic and pro-choice doctors Natalie Psaila and Isabelle Stabile. Stabile told those present that her team was not solely focused on advocating for safe and accessible abortion: “We believe in prevention and ideally we would have as few abortions as we possibly can. That is why access to free contraception and appropriate sex education is important”. Last month, a woman was found guilty of assaulting Stabile during a peaceful roadside protest in Marsa. On Wednesday, the doctor said that together with her colleagues, she was often at the receiving end of threats. Still, the daily threats and strong backlash were not going to stop the doctors from doing what they were doing, she added. Stabile was echoing similar concern by Engerer who earlier told the audience that when in 2021 he was the only Maltese MEP to vote in favour of a report identifying abortion as a human right, he had received so many threats that he was scared to fly back home from Brussels. “The day after I arrived in Malta I had a meeting in Valletta. I told my colleague I was too scared to walk down Republic Street. “So I was waiting for him on Zachary Street when I saw a young woman hanging up her phone and approaching me. I braced myself for the worst, but this woman ran to me, and asked me whether I was Cyrus. When I replied in the affirmative, she started crying and thanking me. ""She said that for the first time, she had felt represented. On the way to the meeting, another four other women similarly stopped me to talk to me,” he recalled, as the event discussed the safety of activists. “If you feel it’s not safe for you, don’t do it. But if you think it’s safe for you, stand up and be counted,” he urged. Engerer said there could be no equality unless everyone was equal and he did not believe Malta should flaunt its equality label until women, migrants and refugees enjoyed the same rights as the rest of the population. He said that countries that do not allow safe and legal access to abortion were committing violence against women. Andorra and Malta are the only European countries that prohibit abortion in all situations. Last year, a woman charged with abortion at home was given a conditional discharge for three years. Before her case last year, it had been nearly a decade since someone faced criminal charges for getting an abortion or providing the means to terminate a pregnancy in Malta. In 2014, a 30-year-old woman received two years’ jail sentence suspended for four years. That same year, a 28-year-old woman was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for two years. It is estimated that some 500 Maltese women purchase abortion pills online every year. Having an abortion or helping someone get an abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison. On Wednesday, Engerer said he has helped at least two Maltese women get an abortion – one in Malta and another in the Netherlands. The PL MEP slammed politicians who represented people in parliament: “I know their views on abortion but they are afraid to speak up."" Referring to the recent legislative changes that will allow doctors to terminate a pregnancy in limited circumstances, Engerer expressed disappointment that despite some hope that the island would finally move away from a total abortion ban, parliamentarians had “backtracked” and approved a watered-down amendment. Professionals have argued that the amendment that was greenlighted by parliament last year was ""regressive"", with doctors now needing to wait for a woman’s life to be in jeopardy to take action. Furthermore, it now also takes three specialists to say an infection is life-threatening while in the past, the consultant would discuss the seriousness of the situation with their own team. Polish MEP Robert Biedron, who participated in the discussion on Wednesday, spoke of a similar ban on abortion in his homeland, where, he said, every pregnancy used to be registered and the authorities would immediately launch an investigation into suspected terminated pregnancies. Polish law allows abortion to safeguard the life or health of pregnant women or where a pregnancy results from rape or incest.  RELATED STORIES  Biedron lamented that the EU had set standards for everything, ranging from car tyres to bananas, but there were no standards for women’s rights. This was unacceptable, he said. Danish MEP Karen Melchior and Swedish MEP Carina Ohlsson also participated in the event. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Fact-check: Scam Facebook posts show airport selling lost luggage for €1,Neville Borg,"Claim: Malta International Airport is selling lost luggage for €1. Verdict: This is a scam that tries to get people to give up their personal and card details. MIA does not sell lost luggage but donates it to charity if it remains unclaimed after six months. A series of Facebook posts advertising the sale of lost luggage for €1 is just the latest in a long line of social media scams. A new Facebook page named “Valletta Airport” has uploaded a series of posts in recently advertising a flash sale of lost luggage against a €1 fee, quickly racking up thousands of followers.. “Phones, laptops, jewelry (sic), money - and other cool surprises - you often find all of this in suitcases”, one such post claims. The posts are often followed by a series of comments from apparently satisfied punters showing off the wares they found within the suitcases they purchased, including wads of cash, phones and branded clothes. Some of the commenters say they were initially sceptical, but “€1 is not such a big price”. This is simply the most recent example of a scam that has travelled around the world, much in the same way as the suitcases supposedly being sold. Similar scams have been detected around Europe, as well as in Australia, the Philippines, South Africa and Sri Lanka. It is also not the first time that this scam has hit Malta. Back in November, Malta International Airport warned against a similar scam being carried out by a different Facebook page.   The scam aims to get hold of people’s personal details in order to eventually steal their money, a technique often known as phishing. The “Valletta Airport” Facebook page directs people towards a fake website posing as the Malta International Airport website, using MIA’s logo and colour scheme.   In slightly broken English, the website tells visitors that the airport is selling off luggage that has remained unclaimed for over six months and donating proceeds to charity. The website’s homepage features several glowing endorsements by people going by typical Maltese names, such as Emma Camilleri, Luke Attard, Maria Farrugia and Adrian Borg, who discuss the goods they got their hands on through their purchases.   The site then asks users to sign up for the purchase, telling them to submit personal details such as their name, address, telephone number and email address. A checkout page follows, where users are asked to submit their card details, as they typically would for any standard online purchase.   Having gotten hold of the unsuspecting user’s personal and card details, the scammers are then free to go on an online shopping spree of their own. The scam uses several manipulated photos recycled from identical scams around Europe and other parts of the world. Many of the photos show stacks of abandoned suitcases lying idly in an airport, alongside signs listing the name of the airport and the price of a suitcase. A reverse image search shows how the same photos were used across different countries, only with the name of the airport and the currency changed to tailor for each country where the scam was being spread.  One of the photos used in Malta's version of the scam.    Meanwhile, the “Valletta Airport” Facebook page is very evidently a fake page that is not linked in any way to the Malta International Airport. Even if we ignore the page’s incorrect name, this is clear from the fact that the page was only created in recent days, using a stock photo of Malta’s airport as both its profile and cover images. When contacted by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for MIA warned against “fraudulent advertisements” leading users to “malicious websites which are not affiliated with Malta International Airport”. The spokesperson explained that unclaimed luggage found within the airport terminal is stored at the airport for six months and logged in an online registry. Anyone who has lost a suitcase can reclaim it by filling in an online form on the airport’s website. If a suitcase remains unclaimed after six months, it is eventually donated to charity, contents and all. “In fact, for the past three months, Malta International Airport has donated any such items left at the terminal to Dar tal-Providenza”, the spokesperson said. This is a scam being shared by a fake Facebook page created in recent days. The scam aims to lure people into giving up their personal and card details. Identical scams have been detected several times before in several countries around the world. The same scam had also travelled to Malta before, with MIA warning against the scam last November. This claim is therefore false, as the evidence clearly refutes the claim.

Theatre audiences face a dilemma: which of the weekend's eight shows to see?,James Cummings,"An unprecedented weekend of over 20 theatre performances across eight different productions has left theatregoers spoilt for choice, but industry experts are concerned that supply is outstripping demand.   From Thursday to Sunday, Malta will see a staggering 21 theatre performances take place at seven theatres across the country, from Spazju Kreattiv to Sala San Duminku to the Manoel Theatre.  And while the number of performances has been greeted positively and lauded as an example of the thriving theatrical scene, some have questioned the sustainability of having so many shows on at the same time.   By comparison, over the same week last year, just four theatre productions were running, according to the Times of Malta What's On guide. In 2019, the same week had just two productions running, while the year before that, there was only one production onstage. From the critically acclaimed Daqsxejn ta' Requiem Għal Leli to Lovesong (L-Għanja tan-Namra), via other reputable productions, theatre organisations will be lobbying to put as many bums on seats as possible. And with a limited number of theatregoers, practitioners fear they could end up out of pocket.    Theatre director and artistic director of independent collective WhatsTheirNames Philip Leone-Ganado said it was an ""issue independent producers have been whispering about in increasingly worried tones for a while"". Leone-Ganado said that while it was tempting to view the number of performances as positive, he views it differently, citing the growing number of companies and artists that require being sustained. ""The current theatre audience in Malta remains small and splitting it so many different ways only makes it harder and harder for any single production to be sustainable.  ""On top of that, producers are already competing for actors and venues. And nobody is winning here; creatives are in high demand but still aren't being paid a living wage by any local producer, because the funds simply aren't there.""   Leone-Ganado said that while this wasn't a new issue facing the theatre world, it was fast approaching ""a tipping point"". ""If we want our fledgling industry to survive and thrive, the only solution is to make less theatre, make it better, make it for longer and make it together,"" he said.  Theatre director and Culture Venture founder Toni Attard agreed that the industry could suffer should so many concurrent performances become a trend.  “Imagine if we had a whole year of eight to 10 productions a week; there isn’t the financial capacity to do so, and the audiences are not there – that would be a huge oversupply and there isn’t enough demand right now.”  Addressing the issue of cost, Attard also stressed that there was a limit to how much people were able to fork out for tickets.   “There’s an economic model there which simply doesn’t work in terms of producing work – and from the audience’s point of view,” said Attard, who is directing the play Is-Snin li Tħoss for two weekends. “We also need to keep in mind that if we really want to diversify the theatre sector... we can’t end up in a situation where it’s only public institutions that can afford to create work,” Attard warned.     He highlighted that with directors having to book venues months in advance, it was difficult to know how productions might clash with others, but added the upcoming weekend was “probably a bit of a one-off situation”.   However, he emphasised that more cooperation within the industry was needed: “We need more communication and sharing of knowledge, but also new repertoire with increased repeatability”. Stressing that having longer-running shows would provide more opportunities for audiences to watch different productions – which could, in turn, mean fewer clashes – he noted, however, that more infrastructure such as storage facilities for costumes and large sets was needed to support this.   Attard, a former strategy director at Arts Council Malta, also called for country-wide audience data such as ticket sales and trends to be available to the sector regularly rather than every few years.   The last time national statistics on theatre attendance were released was in 2021. That year, Arts Council Malta said three-quarters of women and two-thirds of men had reported never going to the theatre.   When contacted, Arts Council Malta said it was aiming to conduct further research into cultural participation this year and next year.    New theatre space?   Echoing Attard’s words, Paul Portelli, actor, theatre director and founding member of Theatre Anon, agreed the sector would benefit from companies working together more.   “There definitely needs to be more synergy between industry stakeholders – we don’t speak enough,” he said.     Agreeing that longer theatre runs would benefit the theatre world, Portelli argued for companies to pool their resources to provide a dedicated theatre space.   “If a group of companies got together, they could share a space that could have productions and workshops running regularly,” he said.  However, Portelli was keen to recognise the positive side to the weekend’s jam-packed theatre schedule, stressing the higher number of productions “shows the scene is healthy”. Number of shows ‘100 per cent positive’  Meanwhile, playwright and theatre director Malcolm Galea said the number of performances this weekend was “100 per cent positive,” stressing they gave audiences more choice while forcing producers to be “more competitive and less self-indulgent”. He noted that while the higher number of offerings could lead to some companies not making any profit, this could encourage them to be more cost-effective, which in the long run could make productions easier to stage.    And with theatre tickets this weekend costing on average around €15 to €20, does Galea think this could prove an issue for theatregoers wanting to attend more than one performance?  “Theatre tickets are more expensive in Malta than abroad,” he conceded, but noted that venue costs were also much higher.  “Public venues are very expensive to rent. Hopefully, with more productions and more independent theatres, this will force the public venues to lower their prices,” he said, adding that as much as a third of a production’s costs could go towards renting a venue.  Stressing the importance of remaining competitive, Galea, who is performing his award-winning show Plastic and Chicken Bones, said local productions should not rely on being “spoon-fed” by public funding, arguing it led to complacency.  “I would like to see more independent venues and productions flourishing – what interests me is creating an independent Maltese theatre scene,” he said.   Most packed 'What's On' guide yet Commenting on the number of theatrical shows this weekend, Stephanie Fsadni, who compiles the Times of Malta What’s On guide, said the sheer number of shows was a first for her.    “Since we've been compiling the What's On guide, I've never seen so many theatre productions happening at the same time. There are eight and a lot is going on in Valletta alone,” she said.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Today's front pages - February 15, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the main stories in Thursday’s newspapers.

"47,000 cross to Gozo for carnival weekend",Mark Laurence Zammit,"More than 47,000 people crossed over to Gozo for the carnival weekend last week, according to figures provided by the Gozo ministry. Between Wednesday and Sunday, Gozo Channel boats ferried almost 15,700 vehicles and almost 42,500 passengers from Ċirkewwa to Mġarr. The four ferries crossed the channel more than 500 times that weekend. Gozo’s main attraction over the weekend was the annual spontaneous carnival in Nadur. Between Thursday and Sunday, another 4,800 passengers took the fast ferry from Valletta’s Grand Harbour to Gozo.   The busiest day for Gozo Channel was Sunday, when it carried almost 5,000 vehicles and more than 14,000 passengers from Gozo back to Malta. The channel this year was roughly equally busy as in previous years, although slightly fewer passengers crossed over to Gozo this year, compared to last year, when almost 48,000 passengers went to Gozo via Ċirkewwa alone. Thousands of people paraded around the main square of Nadur and the streets surrounding the church dressed in all sorts of costumes, from cereal bowls to skiers, gorillas and government workers.   A group of people dressed up as Buddhist monks, another group took out a piano in the street and another dressed up as elderly ladies playing their pension away at bingo. Even mega-developer Joseph Portelli – who hails from Nadur – showed up dressed as a chef.   But one of the highlights was a drove of pigs led by a person dressed up as Rosianne Cutajar holding a placard reading “Kulħadd Jitħanżer” (everybody pigs out). Cutajar had texted that phrase to her friend, Yorgen Fenech back in 2019, as she complained about being left out of cabinet. Elsewhere in Nadur, other revellers took aim at Benna’s hike in milk prices with a carnival float lampooning the company while others danced around a makeshift ambulance while holding a placard calling for the authorities to “legalajs kokajn” (sic) (‘Legalise cocaine’).

"Climate change challenges will not burden Malta, but create opportunities: Abela",Giulia Magri,"People will not have to experience any economic or social burdens as Malta takes on a greener transition to tackle climate change, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Wednesday. “We must take on difficult decisions, but these decisions should not burden our businesses and families,” Abela said in Parliament.  “There are those who argue that we must pay an economic price for these transitions, but I do not believe in that. How can we work on securing our environment when our people do not feel secure? How can we protect the environment when our people have no peace of mind?” Abela was speaking during a discussion on a bill setting up Malta’s first authority monitoring climate action on the island.  Through the proposed Act, the State would acknowledge that change in the Earth’s climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind. He said that instead of creating burdens, the government will ensure that confronting climate change will produce opportunities for the country.  “The correct decisions have the potential to stimulate further job creation, resource efficiency, and expand access to untapped markets, among other things,” he said. Abela said the creation of the Climate Change Authority shows that the government is determined and committed to decisive action on climate change.  Abela said the Climate Action Authority will have a comprehensive mandate, characterised by a holistic perspective, and with social dialogue with all stakeholders at the centre of it.  “It is important that as a country, we take on this fight against climate change,” he said. “We need to believe in the changes we need to make, and that we can move forward with change. We mustn't get lost in partisanship, because if we do, we will not only fail future generations but also today’s population, as we will not make the necessary important decisions.” He said the population want effective solutions and added that it is important to not throw around “conspiracy theories” on climate change to fearmonger people about change.  He recalled how last summer, the Mediterranean region was ranked as a climate-change “hot spot” according to scientists. How numerous Mediterranean countries experienced wildfires that destroyed homes and green spaces, and how Malta experienced hot temperatures that its infrastructure could not take. “Science shows us that it is crystal clear that if we resist change, everyone will suffer,” he said. “The discussion should not be if we take on change, but when and how we will do so.” Abela emphasised that despite the country's size, it should be ready to adopt a proactive stance.  He said that the Climate Change Authority will build on other major changes that are being carried out such as the transformation in favour of cleaner energy, shore-to-ship projects, recycling and Waste-to-energy projects, and the direction in favour of greener investment with the issuance of green bonds and investment in green open spaces. ""This is why we must work differently, that the environment is at the centre of our priority,"" he said. Abela also emphasised the importance of the role of children and youth during the discussions of climate change. He said the government is actively engaged with youths through discussions such as in the Youth Advisory Forum. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Close to €80,000 worth of medical supplies donated to Ukraine in 2022",Times of Malta,"Close to €80,000 worth of medical supplies and equipment was donated to Ukraine back in 2022 while 45 tons of medical equipment was donated last year, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told Parliament.  In 2022, the Directorate of Defense Affairs coordinated and provided medical supplies which cost €79,982. In the same year, a total of 34 tonnes of medical supplies, including bandages and swabs, were donated to Ukraine. Camilleri was replying to a parliamentary question asked by PN MP Darren Carrabott on Wednesday. The humanitarian aid, intended to help Ukraine following its invasion by Russia back in 2022, was sent through the European Union’s civil protection mechanism. Last year, 19 generators and 45 tonnes of medical items were also provided.  Back in December, Malta also donated 25 mine detectors to Ukraine.

'Fake news': Ministry shoots down claims that local farmers get fewer subsidies,Times of Malta,"Updated at 6.30pm with Peter Agius reaction Claims that local farmers are receiving fewer direct subsidies than their Italian counterparts are “fake news” and “populist politics”, the Agriculture Ministry said on Wednesday. The ministry said that Maltese farmers receive more money than Italian ones, through a number of aid schemes not taken into account by the Opposition. It was reacting to a statement by PN MEP candidate Peter Agius, who claimed that an analysis of EU agricultural funding showed that local farmers get just a fraction of the direct aid that Italians farmers get. Agius said Maltese vegetable and legume farmers are eligible to receive €1,400 per hectare of land, versus the €4,100 per hectare allocated to Italian ones. The MEP candidate said this is because the Maltese government has opted to focus heavily on infrastructural aid, as opposed to direct subsidies. Maltese farmers protested earlier this month and intend to do so again on Thursday, saying they are struggling to compete as new EU laws make it easier for cheaper, non-EU fruits and vegetables to be sold locally. In its statement on Wednesday, the Agriculture Ministry said local farmers receive anything between €475.20 and €844.34 per hectare of land through the Basic Income Support for Sustainability scheme, while Italian farmers get between €150.47 and €183.91. Another scheme aimed at encouraging young farmers, the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers (CISYF), guarantees local farmers between €520.64 and €560 per hectare, rising to a maximum of €700 per hectare this year. In Italy, the ministry said, young farmers get a supplement of between €67 and €89.65 per hectare. It said farmers who grow tomatoes have an even greater advantage over Italian ones, receiving a maximum of €8,500 as opposed to Italian farmers, who it said receive a maximum of €191. “This government managed to double the direct assistance given to farmers when compared to 10 years ago,” it said. “This Government has always protected the interests of local farmers and producers who are not only seeing a substantial increase in assistance but are also reassured by all the significant reforms that we have achieved in the valuation of agricultural land regulations.” Peter Agius replies In reaction, MEP candidate Peter Agius said the government should stop hiding in the bureacratic figures. He insisted that Maltese farmers got far fewer subsidies by all accounts as most of the fields are not even registered for EU aid and average holding in Malta is far smaller than in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. A middle-sized farmer in Malta has on average 10 tumuli (1 hectare) while a middle-sized farmer in Italy has an average of 110 tumuli according to EU Commission data. The ratio comparing a middle-sized farmer between the 2 countries is therefore 1 against 11. According to both CAP Strategic Plans, a young middle-sized farmer producing fresh products like legumes and vegetables gets €1,448 from the 1st CAP pillar in 2024 while an Italian one gets €4,097.  A middle-sized Maltese farmer is therefore earning €2,700 less than his Italian counterparts. Apart from this, the percentage allocated to the 1st CAP pillar in Malta according to the EU Commission in 2020 was 26.5 per cent against 69.9 per cent on average in Europe and 62.3 per cent in Italy. “The government should have at the very least allocated the same percentage as the rest of the Europe. That is the main cause of the lack of competitiveness of Maltese farmers,” Agius said in his reply. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Walliams deal helped make 2023 a record year for films, tourism minister claims",Daniel Ellul,"David Walliams helped market the Maltese film industry abroad, Clayton Bartolo said after the British Comedian’s €120,000 paycheck for hosting the Malta Film Awards in January 2022 was revealed earlier this week.  “The Maltese film industry needs to market itself not only locally but also internationally. David Walliams was part of a wide marketing package,” tourism minister Bartolo said on Wednesday.  He said initial indications show 2023 was a “record year for films,” adding that marketing has helped grow the industry.   The reason why legal action was needed to reveal Walliam’s invoice was only because of confidentiality clauses, he said.  “If we break those confidentiality clauses, then we have the reputation of our country at stake, and I wanted to make sure I do not undermine our reputation,” Bartolo said.    “If we lose our reputation, the investment we are making in sound stages and financial incentives would be for nothing”. Walliams's six-figure fee to host the awards was revealed only after a two-year legal battle that ended last month after a judge ordered the Malta Film Commission to reveal how much it paid him. The taxpayer-funded payout has been criticised by some of Malta's leading film-makers, and the Nationalist Party, who calculated that Walliams was paid more every minute than a minimum-wage earner is paid in a month. “You have to appreciate that contract negotiations are not one-sided, but to arrive at an agreement, you need both sides to discuss. Practically every contract has a confidentiality clause, and I believe they should be respected,” he said. “On the other hand, I believe we should respect the court’s judgement,” he said.  Bartolo said that a report showing the investment and return from the 2023 Mediterrane Film Festival will be published in the coming days.  “There, we will show the results achieved as a country and even the investment that took place,” he said.  RELATED STORIES  Asked to clarify if how much money was spent on the festival will be included in the report Bartolo said: “yes of course, 100 per cent”.  Bartolo said he has “full confidence” in Malta Film Commissioner Johann Grech, who has achieved results that “speak for themselves”. “Let’s not forget that we inherited an industry that was not even good as a part-time job, and now we have an industry that employs thousands of people full-time”.  Asked if it was unjust that the local film industry was given €600,000 in the same year Walliams was paid €120,000, the minister said funds for the local film industry increased in 2023.  “But let’s not mix things,” Bartolo said. Walliam’s deal was tied to international marketing to attract foreign productions to Malta.  The local film fund has now been passed on to the culture ministry.

Traffic crashes and casualties were both up in Q4 2023,Times of Malta,"Traffic accidents were up 4.2 per cent between October and December of last year when compared to the same period a year prior, data published on Wednesday showed. Casualties as a result of those crashes were up even more, rising by 12.1 per cent. Seven people died as a result of crashes in those months – the same number of fatalities registered in the same period the previous year. Data published by the National Statistics Office showed that there were 3,977 crashes in the fourth quarter of 2023. More than half of the crashes, 55.3 per cent, involved passenger cars. One in every three collisions (33.3 per cent) involved a motorcycle. More crashes were registered on Tuesdays than any other day of the week, but crashes on Friday were the most likely to result in casualties. The 9am to 11.59pm window was the most dangerous for drivers, with more crashes reported during those hours than others.   Birkirkara, St Paul’s Bay and Qormi – three of Malta’s largest towns – reported the most crashes during the period under review. All districts recorded an increase in road traffic accidents except for the South Eastern and Gozo and Comino district, which recorded a decrease, when compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year. The Northern Harbour district registered the highest percentage increase in road traffic accidents at 10.4 per cent, followed by the Northern district at 6.6 per cent.

Maltese scientist studies global warming ‘leaking’ in Antarctica,James Cummings,"A University of Malta scientist has spent two weeks in Antarctica studying how global warming is changing the shape of the seabed and the life which inhabits it. Aaron Micallef, from the university’s Department of Geosciences, was part of a two-man team researching how and where climate change is leading to freshwater “leaking” from the ocean floor. Micallef and his German colleague, Thomas Müller, spent around six days carrying out fieldwork aboard a Zodiac, a type of small inflatable landing craft popular with science teams. They collected water samples and recorded video footage of the seabed. “We hope this journey will help raise awareness about how our actions can, unfortunately, lead to adverse effects on remote and untouched places like Antarctica,” he said, adding the team hopes to be ready to publish the results by June. The expedition was co-organised by the scientific journal National Geographic. The university professor travelled to the world’s southernmost continent as part of a two-man team to study the impact of global warming on the oceans’ floors. The expedition saw Micallef and his German professor colleague visit several coastal sites along the western Antarctic peninsula, where they collected water samples and recorded video footage of the seabed.   Speaking to Times of Malta just after returning from the expedition, Micallef described the experience as “extraordinary, almost beyond the power of words to capture”. Their journey began on January 27 in the southern Argentine town of Ushuaia, where they boarded the National Geographic Explorer, an ice-class expedition ship and the organisation’s flagship. The voyage saw them spending two days crossing the infamous Drake Passage, a treacherous stretch of open water just above the Southern Ocean where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet. According to National Geographic, some of the world’s strongest ocean currents flow through the Drake Passage and “huge rogue waves”, even higher than 65 feet, have been reported. Upon reaching Antarctica, Micallef and Müller spent around six days carrying out fieldwork aboard their small inflatable landing craft.   Describing the western Antarctic peninsula as “experiencing the most significant warming in the southern hemisphere”, the Maltese scientist said the purpose of their visit was to find places where freshwater is “leaking” from the ocean floor due to global warming. He said they wanted to see how this was affecting the shape of the seabed and the life which inhabits it. But, in addition to the scientific value of the expedition, Micallef described how the region had a significant personal impact on him. “I consider it as one of the most stunning locations I have ever visited. The coastline is dramatic, breathtaking and unspoiled, adorned with vivid colours,” he said. Sharing that Antarctica had always been at the top of his dream destinations list, Micallef described the continent as “teeming with wildlife, offering us intimate encounters with various whales, seals, penguins and birds”.   The university professor said he saw the expedition as a foundation for more ambitious and thorough fieldwork that he hoped to undertake soon. He said the team was hoping to be able to publish the results of their studies by June. Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent on the planet, larger than both Europe and Oceania. It is home to the largest single piece of ice on earth – the Antarctic Ice Sheet – according to National Geographic. At this time of year, summer in the southern hemisphere, temperatures in Antarctica hover around 0°C. In winter, however, the temperature in coastal regions can drop to around -30°C and even lower inland. By winter, surface ice in Antarctica grows by about six times to reach around 19 million square kilometres.   The expedition was part of a Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic voyage, with the financial support of the Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Fund. It was not the first sea expedition for Micallef, however, who, in August, was part of a team to discover three large underwater volcanoes and a 100-metre shipwreck off Sicily’s south-west coast. Logistic support was provided by Lindblad Expeditions with additional support given by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Micallef represented the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, in California and Müller the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, in Germany.

Farmers to protest for a second time on Thursday,Times of Malta,"Farmers intend to protest for a second time on Thursday, again taking to their tractors and rallying from Ta’ Qali to Valletta. Organised by Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi and with the backing of various other organisations related to food production, the protest will seek to build on the success of farmers’ first protest, held two weeks ago. That event – farmers’ first organised protest in a generation – was part of a Europe-wide protest movement by EU farmers, who say they are being squeezed out of business by overly stringent European regulations and free trade deals that open up EU markets to cheaper foreign-grown fruits and vegetables. In a statement announcing Thursday’s protest, farmers said that they will also be presenting the government with various proposals which would help them weather the impact of such EU plans.  RELATED STORIES  Thursday’s event is scheduled to begin at 11.45am and will see farmers drive through Attard, the Mrieħel bypass, Marsa-Ħamrun bypass, Aldo Moro Road, Blata l-Bajda and Floriana before ending at Triq l-Għassara tal-Għeneb, along Valletta’s waterfront. There, the vehicles will be parked and a press conference held at around 2pm. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Maltese farmers getting short-changed on EU direct subsidies: Peter Agius,Times of Malta,"Maltese farmers are only getting one-third of the direct EU subsidies for farmland that their Italian counterparts receive, Peter Agius has said. The PN MEP candidate made the claim after analysing national Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) strategy plans submitted by the Maltese and Italian governments in 2022. While Italian farmers growing vegetables and legumes receive up to €4,100 in subsidies per hectare, Maltese farmers can only pocket a maximum of €1,400 per hectare. That means local farmers must offset the difference - €2,700 per hectare – if they are to compete with imported vegetables, Agius said. “Robert Abela has blamed the EU for the farmers’ situation, but figures show that his government has negotiated a very unfair deal for Maltese farmers under the same EU policies which the Italians used for much more generous subsidies,” Agius said on Tuesday. “The EU is simply the tool which the government is not using well enough, and as we all know, a bad workman quarrels with his tools.” The CAP - the EU's single largest budgetary expense - is a complex system of funding and subsidies made available to farmers within member states. It is built on two main pillars: one focused on direct subsidies given to farmers, and the other focused on financial aid to improve farming infrastructure and machinery.  Malta has traditionally opted to allocate the lion's share of its CAP funding to the latter, providing EU-backed funding for things like the reconstruction of rubble walls, restoration of reservoirs and purchase of more sustainable machinery.  As a result, farmers receive less money in direct subsidies when compared to many other member states, and spend more time filling in complex EU-related paperwork - something they highlighted as an issue in their recent protest. Agius, who has spoken on several occasions about local farming and its challenges, noted that Maltese farmers are also disadvantaged from the outset, as less agricultural land is eligible for CAP funding than in Italy. While 80 per cent of agricultural land in Italy is declared for CAP purposes, that figure falls to just 55 per cent in Malta. As a result, local produce is being gradually edged out of local markets. Agius noted that the share of local produce on the Maltese food market now stands at 20 per cent, while it stood at 60 per cent before Malta joined the EU. “Malta-produced food is being pushed out of the market by design,” he said, noting that led to higher food costs, higher emissions due to food imports and a greater risk of food insecurity. “The writing is on the wall – reverse this trend or be condemned to higher food prices or even risk hunger in case of international crises,” Agius said.

Balzan council and residents object to Polidano’s bid to sanction illegal works,Matthew Xuereb,"The Balzan local council and numerous residents have filed objections with the Planning Authority to an application by construction magnate Charles Polidano, iċ-Ċaqnu, to sanction illegal works carried out at four historic Balzan townhouses, in defiance of court judgments. They insisted that the works carried out on site were illegal and this was confirmed by the court of appeal, which upheld the revocation of two permits for works carried out on the 300-year-old townhouses and their gardens along Main Street in the heart of the locality. Polidano filed a fresh application in September to sanction the illegalities carried out on site, as well as requesting permission to carry out “additions, alterations and restoration” on the four adjoining houses. The application covers the illegal construction of a pool and reservoir and a new facade for an extension built overlooking the gardens, as well as earlier works. Polidano had already defied the planning regulator by initially steaming ahead with works on the large swimming pool and deck, after the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal had revoked his permits. The works were only halted after he was formally notified of the decision. The tribunal had ruled that the illegalities, covered by two enforcement notices, should have automatically excluded his application from being considered. The site is in the Balzan village core, close to the parish church. One of the properties, a palazzo and its gardens, dates to the time of the knights and is said to have been used by Grand Master Emmanuel De Rohan as his country residence. The building next door served as the servants’ quarters and near it was a building used as stables. The property also has an underground cistern. In 2011, the PA had issued an emergency conservation order with a list of remedial works that needed to be carried out on the buildings. A year later, the palazzo was included in the national list of scheduled buildings. Polidano appealed a court-imposed fine, handed down in 2013 after he allegedly uprooted trees and destroyed a rubble wall in the gardens behind the properties. The appeals court eventually reduced the fine to €10,000. The Balzan council objected to the sanctioning application, insisting that the work had been carried out without the necessary permits and should be reversed to its original state. One resident wrote that, since the permits were revoked, all work was classified as illegal and had to be reversed. “It is clear that the developer’s thinking is such that they can do as they please and then request sanctioning of those works afterwards,” the resident wrote. “I find it grossly unfair that, as a matter of practice, the Planning Authority takes the view that, once a development application is submitted, no enforcement in relation to illegalities is executed. It is even more astonishing when one considers that the development in question on the same site is subject to two enforcement notices and an emergency conservation order. As the saying goes, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me,” she continued. Environment NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa also objected to the application, expressing its concern about the “illegal destruction” of the garden. It insisted that this illegal work must not be legalised through approval of this request for sanctioning. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"‘A waste of public funds': film-makers on Walliams’ €120,000 fee",Mark Laurence Zammit,"Some of Malta’s leading film-makers have criticised the €120,000 paid to David Walliams to host the Malta Film Awards, saying it was “a waste of public funds”. If the government had that much money to spend on a show presenter, it should have no excuse to increase funding for the local industry, they argue.  “It’s great to hear the finance minister has that much money to spend on a show host, as that means he should also have enough money to significantly bump up funding for local film productions,” film-maker Abigail Mallia told Times of Malta. “The problem is it makes no sense to spend €120,000 on a presenter for an event that celebrates film when all of Malta’s films got just €600,000 to share between them that same year.”   The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation revealed on Monday that Walliams, a British comedian and author, was paid a whopping €120,000 to host the Malta Film Awards back in January 2022. The Malta Film Commission continuously refused to reveal the fee and the issue ended in a two-year legal battle that was decided last month, when a judge ordered the government entity to publish the figure.  Mallia – the director of major motion picture Limestone Cowboy – asked what the local film industry benefitted from Walliams hosting the show and said it made no sense to organise an awards show when there weren’t even enough local films to begin with. Film producer and former film commissioner Oliver Mallia agreed, noting that what was intended to be an annual awards ceremony was only organised once. This was due to the insufficient number of local films produced each year,  which don’t justify a local annual awards competition, Mallia said.    Mallia, one of the producers of Luzzu, criticised Walliams’ fee as a waste of public funds, particularly during a calendar year when local filmmakers had no opportunity to apply for public funding to develop or produce films. “Good luck to Walliams for securing such a sweet deal,"" he said. ""However, I’ve observed numerous high-profile actors, more renowned than Walliams, receiving significantly less compensation for longer, more strenuous, and demanding roles,” he said. Mallia also noted that the amount paid to Walliams in 2022 exceeded what productions like Luzzu and Limestone Cowboy received from the Malta Film Fund. The amount granted per project by the fund, renamed as Creative Malta in 2023, was raised to €380,000 following a public outcry from local producers during and after the Malta Film Awards. The fund was also moved out of the film commission's control and is now administered by Arts Council Malta, which falls under the Culture Ministry.  Mallia noted that Walliams was brought back to Malta last year to host another state-funded film festival, the Mediterrane Film Festival.   “We must also remember that the revealed amount that Walliams received is only for an event in 2022. My assumption is that he didn’t receive a lesser amount for presenting the Mediterrane Film Festival, held for the first time last year,” he said.   The Tourism Ministry has resisted requests to reveal how much that festival cost, though minister Clayton Bartolo has said they will do so ""in the coming days"" following a court ruling.   Count of Monte Cristo production manager Malcolm Scerri Ferrante said if the professionally-filmed Malta Film Awards had been broadcast abroad, the fee might have been worth it. “Sometimes an international star is needed to sell a TV show abroad to a major broadcaster that would in turn, in this case, promote Malta globally and bring even more tourists. If the plan is to air the show on a major TV network, then this fee is not unreasonable.”  RELATED STORIES  It is unclear whether the show - which was held two years ago - was or will ever be broadcast on any major international network. Questions sent to the Film Commissioner remained unanswered.   Actor and crew member Matthew Maggi, who is based in Canada, said the film commissioner is only able to run the government institution in this way because he is allowed to. ""There are no repercussions, nor pushback, from the people who are above him, nor from the people who should be benefitting from the funds, that is, film-makers, artists, actors, crew members and film workers,"" he said. Meanwhile, in a statement on Tuesday, PN spokespersons for the cost of living and the arts – Ivan Castillo and Julie Zahra – said Walliams’ “exuberant” fee revealed the government has the wrong priorities.   Instead of using tax money to help workers, students, teachers and the most vulnerable people, the government had no problem paying Walliams’ €120,000 “for two and a half hours of work”. Walliams was paid more money for every minute than a minimum-wage earner is paid in a month, they said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

'Business as usual' for The Body Shop in Malta as its UK business sinks,AFP,"Malta branches of cosmetics brand The Body Shop will remain open, a company spokesperson has said following news that the company has gone into administration in the UK.  On Tuesday, administrators announced that the UK arm of the near 50-year-old cosmetics company renowned for ethical hair and skin products had entered bankruptcy, placing thousands of jobs at risk. The retailer has appointed experts from FRP Advisory to oversee administration — a UK process where financial experts are drafted in to try and save parts of a firm. Responding to questions, a spokesperson told Times of Malta that the company's eight stores in Malta would remain open.  ""This announcement does not impact our franchise businesses, so [it's] business as usual in Malta,"" the spokesperson said.  She said the company had taken ""swift action"" in the past month, including closing its The Body Shop At Home arm — which allowed users to sell the company's products from the comfort of their own homes — and selling its business across most of Europe and in parts of Asia. Describing the administration process in the UK as ""the next important step"" in the company's restructuring, the spokesperson said it related ""to the UK business only and does not impact our Global Head Franchise Partners."" On Tuesday, the administrators brought in to save the floundering British company said in a statement that, ""The Body Shop International Limited have appointed Tony Wright, Geoff Rowley, and Alastair Massey of FRP as joint administrators of the company. ""Taking this approach provides the stability, flexibility and security to find the best means of securing the future of The Body Shop and revitalising this iconic British brand."" Administrators will update creditors and employees in due course. German private equity firm Aurelius had bought The Body Shop only in November, but the retailer ran into trouble in a tough economic climate over the key Christmas trading period. ""The Body Shop failed to scrub out a sales decline, with damp revenues during the crucial festive period pushing an icon of eco beauty into administration,"" lamented Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. The Body Shop was founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick and has become a staple of the British high street, but it has been under various owners since she sold it to French cosmetics giant L'Oreal in 2006. The Body Shop has about 200 shops in the UK, or around seven per cent of its worldwide total of some 3,000 stores in more than 70 countries. The company directly employs about 10,000 staff, while 12,000 more are employed via franchises.  Roddick, who died in 2007 from a brain haemorrhage, had rapidly expanded the business from modest beginnings with a determination to offer products that had not been tested on animals.  She set out also to make her business environmentally friendly, with customers encouraged to return empty containers for refilling at the original shop in Brighton, on England's southern coast. ""In the 1980s, the Body Shop was the place to go for young shoppers to splash out on fresh scented bubbles and beauty ranges, with a deep environmental conscience and a focus on social justice and conserving nature,"" added Streeter. ""But now stores like Lush hold the bigger pocket money draw for tweens and teens, lured in by fragrant bath bombs and innovative product ingredients. ""Rivals have stolen a march on what used to be the Body Shop's unique eco-credentials."" Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos, which had bought The Body Shop from L'Oreal, sold it at the end of last year to Aurelius for £207 million ($261 million at current exchange rates), far less than the previous owners had paid. Since taking over, Aurelius had already sold The Body Shop business in most of mainland Europe and parts of Asia to an unnamed buyer. ""The Body Shop has faced an extended period of financial challenges under past owners, coinciding with a difficult trading environment for the wider retail sector,"" administrators added in Tuesday's statement. ""Having taken swift action in the last month, including closing down The Body Shop At Home and selling its business across most of Europe and in parts of Asia, focusing on the UK business is the next important step in The Body Shop's restructuring.""

Banks are often not giving new customers full information,Times of Malta,"Most local banks are failing to give new customers information about the early repayment of loans or account fees, a mystery shopper exercise has indicated. The Malta Financial Services Authority and European Banking Authority carried out a mystery shopper exercise to assess how banks and other credit instititions are treating customers seeking loans or payment accounts, what information they are providing them and what they are failing to disclose. People posing as prospective clients were sent to financial institutions with instructions to request a personal loan or account and to track responses and information given. In 50 interactions made regarding personal loans, key information was not disclosed at the initial inquiry stage, costs were not clearly explained and shoppers told to check bank websites instead of being given direct answers. In 62 per cent of cases, mystery shoppers were not given information about conditions related to early repayments of loans. More positively, practically all (96 per cent) of institutions reviewed did not try to increase the credit requested by the mystery shopper by for example automatically adding a payable fee to the loan amount. Furthermore, client-facing staff did not actively try to cross-sell other bank products. Mystery shoppers were also tasked with asking about opening a new account in 50 separate interactions with bank staff. In just 11 per cent of cases were they given details about the full range of payment options available. In 75 per cent of cases, staff, did not discuss optional services associated with these accounts. And in 63 per cent of cases, banks did not give prospective clients a document detailing account fees. These documents were only given to customers when they asked for them, and were often hard to locate on institutions’ websites. The documents themselves were generally in line with standards required by regulations. ""While certain positive practices were observed, the findings highlight areas where institutions need to improve,” said MFSA head of conduct supervision Sarah Pulis.  “Information on costs and rights should be readily available and presented clearly to consumers, across all channels, as early as at enquiry stage. The MFSA also expects bank staff to be regularly trained on product knowledge, professional conduct, and accurate information provision.” Pulis said financial institutions seemed to be very willing to take the feedback onboard and improve their processes. Christopher P. Buttigieg, MFSA’s chief officer supervision, added: ""Ensuring that the interests of consumers are properly safeguarded is one of the MFSA’s primary objectives. Our supervision also focuses on the business conduct of financial service entities, to make sure they always act in the best interest of consumers. This mystery shopping exercise continues to underline the importance that we give to consumer protection."" You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Flamingo poachers spared jail time but have hunting bans confirmed,Edwina Brincat,"Two cousins found guilty of shooting a protected flamingo in 2013 have been spared jail time on appeal, but had a permanent ban on their hunting licences confirmed.  The case dated back 11 years to the night between June 3 and 4, 2013 when the protected bird was shot down in the Salini nature reserve by a man later identified by eyewitnesses as Justin Attard, then 24 years old.  The poacher fled the scene, getting into a white Mitsubishi Pajero that drove up to him after he shot the flamingo. Police later found the getaway vehicle, which was locked. On the passenger side, they found a pink feather which was subsequently tested by a DNA expert and found to match the shot flamingo.  Four suspects, namely Justin Attard, his father Edgar Attard, his cousin Cliff Borg and Massimo Parnis were jointly charged with conspiring to commit a crime in breach of the Wild Birds Conservation Regulation.  Justin Attard and Borg were separately charged with hunting the flamingo, keeping the protected bird, breaching hunting regulations as well as possession of a firearm in the vicinity of the bird sanctuary.  The pair were also charged with relapsing. In 2016, Justin’s father and Parnis were cleared of all charges by a Magistrates’ Court which, however, declared Justin and his cousin guilty, condemning them each to a two-year effective jail term and a fine of €9,000. Their hunting licences were also permanently revoked.  Both filed an appeal on various grounds. Their lawyers cast doubt on the eyewitnesses’ identification of Attard as the man who shot the flamingo.  They argued that that testimony was not credible since it was unlikely that the eyewitnesses could identify the suspect across the distance from their apartment and in pitch darkness.  Moreover, one of the witnesses had admitted that he had poor eyesight and had, in fact, acquired spectacles after the incident. There were certain inconsistencies in the witnesses’ accounts, argued the lawyers.  Attard also claimed that he used to leave the keys in his unlocked car and therefore anyone could make use of it.  The defence cast doubt on the identification parade, arguing that those alongside the accused were plainclothes officers, older than Attard, thus making him stand out among the rest.  The punishment handed down was also excessive, argued the lawyers.  When delivering judgment on Tuesday the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri - who was assigned the case last year- focused on the evidence put forward by the prosecution. Not only had the DNA expert confirmed the matching feather but Attard had been identified by more than one eyewitness, even years after the incident during court proceedings.  The court was satisfied that the testimonies concurred on the main facts.  And frankly speaking, the court did not believe Attard’s account about leaving his car unlocked, said the judge, pointing out that when police came across the vehicle it had been locked.  As for Borg, the court concluded that the prosecution had failed to present satisfactory evidence that he was involved in the shooting of the protected bird.  After the incident, police found Borg at a field belonging to his cousin. But that did not automatically render him an accomplice in the flamingo incident. The court thus him acquitted of those charges but confirmed the conviction in respect of a decoy and other stuffed species police had discovered in his possession.  Attard’s conviction was confirmed but when sentencing the accused, the court observed that punishment was not meant to be a sort of payback by society but was aimed at educating and reforming the accused who would then be reintegrated in society.  The court also took note of the fact that the incident took place in 2013 and years had passed until the case reached final judgment.  The updated criminal records of both cousins showed that neither had any brush with the law for a long time. A social inquiry report was also presented in respect of Attard.  When all was considered, the court confirmed Attard’s conviction but varied the jail term to a two-year term suspended for two years whilst confirming the €9000 fine.  A suspended sentence was no “let off” and “no slap on the hand,” observed Judge Camilleri, warning the appellant to be wary of committing any other offence during the operative period.  As for Borg, his jail term was revoked and his fine was reduced to €5000.  Court expenses totaling €3,385.24 were to be shared equally and the permanent revocation of their licences was also confirmed.  Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit assisted the appellants.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Schoolchildren to be taught about animal welfare in MSPCA-linked lessons,Press Release,"Schoolchildren are to be taught about animal welfare through an initiative between the Education Ministry and Malta Society for the Protection and Care of Animals (MSPCA). The initiative, named Acts of Kindness, will see children taught about caring for animals during Personal, Social and Career Development (PSCD) classes. Teaching will be done through an activity book as well as through school visits by MSPCA members, the government said in a statement announcing the initiative. “This initiative is a way of emphasising the importance of animal welfare while also teaching children about something they love. A well-rounded education means raising children to be responsible citizens in all walks of life,” Education Minister Clifton Grima said. Louiselle Grech from MSPCA said the project is intended to promote empathy, responsible behaviour and more awareness about caring for animals. The project is being backed by M&Z plc and Borg Cardona & Co. Ltd. For more information, contact MSPCA on 79530468 or info@maltaspca.org.

"Caritas: Drug reform plan is good, provided maximum limits are not changed",Times of Malta,"Caritas wants drug laws changed to give the courts more discretion when judging individual cases, without changing legal limits for drug courts. The NGO made the suggestion in feedback given to the government as part of a public consultation exercise concerning proposals to change drug laws. It said that it agreed with most of the planned changes but has ""serious reservations"" about a controversial proposal to increase drug court limits. Instead, it would like the law revised to make those limits indicative, with magistrates given the power to apply them when they see fit.  Its proposals were endorsed by a dozen other NGOs and organisations that work in drug or poverty-related fields.  The government has proposed a series of changes, ranging from increasing the number of people who sit on a drug offenders rehabilitation board to ensuring prisoners caught with drugs are sent to rehab rather than additional jail time. But one suggestion – that of increasing the maximum amount of various drugs that a person can be caught with while being sent to a drug court – proved highly controversial. Drug courts are established by a magistrate when an accused person charged with aggravated possession, drug trafficking or another drug-related crime is deemed to be better served if sentenced to rehabilitation rather than prison. Drug courts can only be established, however, if the accused is caught with an amount of drugs below legally established limits. The government has argued that it wants to increase the limits to give magistrates additional leeway to send drug addicts to rehab. The Opposition has said that raising the limits will encourage more drug trafficking, with sellers incentivised to claim they are addicts if caught. Opposition leader Bernard Grech has said the White Paper should be withdrawn altogether. On Tuesday, NGOs and associations that work with drug addicts and drug-related scenarios said that they saw many positive things in the proposed reform, but were seriously concerned about the plans to raise drug court limits. They said that raising the limits could encourage people to start trafficking drugs by reducing the fear of going to prison if caught. Genuine addicts, they said, were unlikely to possess the large amounts of drugs proposed in the law. The NGOs therefore said it would make more sense if the maximum limits currently established in the law remained unchanged, but became indicative rather than prescriptive. That would allow magistrates to set up a drug court for anyone caught with amounts of drugs just over the established limits, if they believe the accused has an addiction problem. In cases where people with genuine addiction issues are caught with amounts of drugs far above the drug court limits, the courts should be empowered to freeze those proceedings while the person undergoes rehabilitation, the NGOs suggested.  RELATED STORIES  “The fear of going to prison can be a powerful motivational factor in getting a person to seek treatment,” they noted. “It takes around two years for a person to go through a full Caritas rehab program. After that, instead of being sentenced to prison they can be given a suspended sentence or ordered to do community work.” The NGOs also suggested amending the law to give magistrates the discretion to hand down suspended sentences or community work orders to people who face their day in court several years after reforming themselves and getting off drugs. “Caritas believes the White Paper includes very good proposals, and if the serious concerns about increasing drug court limits is addressed, it can be a golden opportunity to ensure a truly effective, balanced and efficient reform that leads to fairer outcomes for drug addicts and the victims addiction create,” it said.

"PN: Government paid David Walliams €120,000 while workers struggle to get by",Times of Malta,"Paying David Walliams €120,000 to host an awards show is a clear sign that the government’s priorities are all wrong, the PN said on Tuesday. PN MPs Ivan Castillo and Julie Zahra noted that Walliams’ huge fee meant the comedian pocketed €821 for every minute of the roughly 150-minute awards show, held in January 2022. “That is more than a minimum wage worker earns in a month,” the two MPs said in a statement. Minimum wage workers earn €213.54 per week. Castillo and Zahra contrasted extravagant spending with citizens’ concerns about the cost of living, which surveys regularly rank as the biggest worry on people’s minds. “Instead of prioritising this and doing something about it, as many EU member states with much lower inflation rates have done, Robert Abela’s government is burning though public funds in an especially irresponsible way,” the MPs said. “Instead of giving teachers what they deserve or investing to combat the rising cost of living, the government’s priority is to help its inner circle. While the government taxes your COLA cheques, it is handing others cheques of €120,000,” they added. Walliams’ fee for hosting the 2022 awards was made public on Monday, after an almost two-year-long legal battle that saw the Tourism Ministry and Malta Film Commission file one appeal after another to try and block the information from being made public. They were finally compelled to release the figure following a legal decision last month. The government originally budgeted €400,000 for the film awards, meaning Walliams was paid 30 per cent of the award show’s original budget. It later emerged that the show and its ancillary events cost taxpayers €1.3 million. The Malta Film Awards have not been held for a second time. Another film festival, which Walliams also hosted in Malta, the 2023 Mediterrane Film Festival, cost ""at least €1 million"" to organise.

Malta must not participate in military activity supporting genocide: Activists,Times of Malta,"Moviment Graffitti is staunchly against Malta joining the EU’s Red Sea mission, Operation Aspides, saying participation would go against Malta’s constitutional principle of neutrality and active peace-seeking.  Malta is “considering” participating in the EU’s Red Sea mission to defend commercial ships from Yemeni Houthi attacks, according to MaltaToday.  “We call on Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri, Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg, and Prime Minister Robert Abela to ensure Malta stays out of Operation Aspides,” Graffitti said in a statement on Tuesday.  The NGO said that Malta’s participation in Aspides would help restore normal trade with Israel, a country accused of genocide and killing thousands of Palestinians in attacks on Gaza.  ""Moviment Graffitti appeals to the Maltese Government to instead direct its efforts for the restoration of safe trade passage through the Red Sea route by working within international institutions towards a permanent ceasefire and an end to the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza,"" the NGO said. In November 2023, the Ansarullah ‘Houthi’ movement started attacking commercial ships connected to Israeli companies, saying that they will continue to do so until humanitarian aid is delivered to Gaza and Israel ceases its aggression.  According to the statement, this act of resistance has disrupted 12 percent of global trade, with 95 per cent of all routes that previously passed through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, being rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope.  “This is causing up to 30-day delays and more than doubling of the cost of exports, apart from serious corporate divestment,” the statement read.  OCCL and Evergreen, two shipping giants, have publicly announced that they would no longer accept any Israeli cargo, with most others suspending their routes that pass through the region. ""While the response from most Western countries in trying to stop the genocide in Gaza has been meek at best, and actively supportive of genocide at worst, the response to strained trade routes has been resounding with the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and others all signing on to Operation Prosperity Guardian, a military operation that has seen airstrikes against Ansarallah targets on both land and sea,"" Graffitti said. The NGO continued that while the EU has not wholly supported the operation, EU member states have approved a Common Security and Defence Policy military operation in the Red Sea seeking to protect merchant ships by intercepting attacks against them. This has seen the contribution of Italian frigates and guided missile destroyers, a US aircraft carrier and a German air defence frigate. These vessels armed with highly advanced weapons are making their way to the Red Sea in preparation to support Israeli trade, and thwart resistance against Israel’s genocide. “We demand that Malta does its utmost to stop this escalation of violence from taking place and ensure that no Maltese resources, officers or staff have any involvement in this operation,” Graffitti said.  “Doing so would be breaking the principle of our constitutional neutrality which clearly states that Malta should refuse to “…to participate in any military alliance…” as well as actively pursue “…peace, security and social progress among all nations…” It ended the statement by calling for Malta to not aid and abet genocide, whether directly or by proxy.

‘Unhackable’ quantum network demonstrated for first time in Malta,Jessica Arena,"The first “unhackable” quantum communication network has been successfully demonstrated in Malta for the first time, paving the way for heightened cybersecurity systems to be introduced to the country. The technology is being developed here by the Physical Security for Public Infrastructure in Malta (PRISM) Consortium, which is partially funded by the EU in an effort to simplify cutting-edge technology into products that can be integrated into any entity’s security system. Professor André Xuereb, CEO of the project’s technical lead Merqury Cybersecurity Limited, explained that any technology existing today in which data or information is sent from point A to point B over a network is hackable. While cybersecurity has made great advances, the advent of easily accessible quantum computers on the horizon means that those who seek to steal data will be able to do so with little effort. But if the quantum technology is utilised within the network itself it creates the possibility of neutralising that threat.  “Every means we have to communicate securely, whether it’s buying something from a website speaking to a friend, is secured using encryption protocols, which we now know are breakable. Breaching this system is how most people perceive hacking into a computer system and stealing information works,” Xuereb told Times of Malta. “But here we’re talking about an even deeper level of hacking, which is someone listening in on the communications channel, on the fibre optic of the actual network. And there’s nothing we can do: if someone digs a hole and finds a fibre, they can listen in on the encrypted conversation.” Right now, anyone listening in on this ‘conversation’ will only find encrypted data. But, Xuereb continues, the scientific community strongly believes that in a few years’ time quantum computers will be more widely accessible and will allow people to unencrypt such data in a matter of seconds. “That’s why it’s important to develop new technologies which counteract this threat. And, as it turns out, the only technology we know of that can counteract this threat is the use of what we call quantum key distribution of quantum secure communications,” he said. The demonstration was able to showcase this when the first link of the network between the Department of ICT at the University of Malta and the Department of Physics was turned on in front of a public audience for the first time.   In a national first, it also marks a significant milestone in the development of a robust nationwide quantum communication network, which promises to provide an unprecedented level of cybersecurity in the years to come. “What we demonstrated today is a groundbreaking technology which any entity can use to easily embrace next-generation cybersecurity. With this technology, anyone can incorporate quantum-secured communication into their network without having to overhaul their entire IT infrastructure,” Xuereb said. Merqury CTO Noel Farrugia said that the successful launch of this cutting-edge technology augured success for the goal of deploying quantum-secured communication links over standard networks. “With this public demonstration, we aimed to reach three goals. First, to showcase to the attendees what an actual quantum key distribution device looks like, and the physical requirements for such devices to work. Second is the ease by which our software stack allows anyone to encrypt traffic with QKD-generated keys,” he said. “Finally, we are continuing our efforts in raising awareness about what the quantum threat means, and what tools and techniques are available to overcome such a threat.” The PRISM project is being undertaken by Merqury Cybersecurity Limited, RSM Malta, Melita Limited, Umnai Limited, the University of Malta, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate and the Malta Information Technology Agency. The EU co-funded project aims to establish a country-wide ultra-secure quantum communications network. It aligns with the European Commission’s extensive efforts to develop a Europe-wide Quantum Communication Infrastructure (EuroQCI). As Malta’s designated project within this initiative, PRISM will spearhead the development of a quantum-secure network across the Maltese islands and its connection to the wider European network.

'The first step to closure' - families of Sliema murdered couple,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The families of a couple murdered in their Sleima home in 2020 said the news that one of the alleged killers will plead guilty in exchange for a 40-year prison sentence was ""the first step towards closure"". ""Hopefully, this conclusion is the first step in bringing closure, although nothing can be done to bring the loved ones back,"" Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski- the brothers of murdered men, Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski- told Times of Malta  yesterday. ""Needless to say, we now look forward to the swift closure of all three cases pending trial."" Pandolfino and Maciejowski were murdered inside their Locker Street home in August 2020. One of the three men awaiting trial for the Sliema double murder- Jesper Kristiansen- admitted the murder in court on Monday after agreeing to a plea deal. Kristiansen, a Danish national, had fled Malta following the murder but was arrested 10 days later in Spain, after the Spanish police tracked him down in Cadiz, and extradited him to Malta to face criminal charges.  The other two men facing murder charges in the case are Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national Viktor Dragomanski. Prosecutors opted to charge the three separately but yesterday informed the criminal court that the three had been put together under one joint bill of indictment. That meant Kristiansen, Dragomanski and Muka were to stand trial together. However, Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras noted a joint note filed by the prosecution and Kristiansen's defence team, which said that the parties had agreed on the terms of a plea bargain.  The court was informed that Kristiansen would enter a guilty plea against the agreed punishment of 40 years and his share of court expenses. The accused, assisted by lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto, confirmed that he understood the implications of that note.  AG lawyer Kevin Valletta then asked for the separation of proceedings, meaning that Dragomanski and Muka would part company with Kristiansen. The request was upheld. Kristiansen is expected to formally confirm his plea at another sitting in the near future.  Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison if found guilty. Once his plea deal is formalised, he will also be able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta is prosecuting. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto are counsel to Kristiansen. Lawyers Joe Giglio and Michaela Giglio are appearing parte civile. The families of the murdered couple also thanked the police, the courts, the attorney general's office, and their parte civile lawyers ""for their hard work to solve and bring these terrible murders to justice"". Last October, the two brothers had lamented court delays, telling Times of Malta that they were ""devastated"" and ""extremely disappointed"" at how one of the other alleged killers- Muka- had his trial postponed to April.  Back then they had said the families ""all desperately needed closure"" and that delays added ""unnecessary heartache"".

Man allegedly shot by son refuses to testify,Matthew Xuereb,"A man has been cleared of shooting his father after he refused to testify against his son. Peter Azzopardi told Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace that he did not want to testify against his son Steven, 37, who stood charged with trying to kill him, threatening him and attempting extortion. The shooting incident took place outside their home in Għargħur in April 2018 when a family dispute over property heated up. The father was shot in the shoulder in a field just off Sqaq it-Xaqquf and his son was arrested shortly afterwards. Despite having a 0.22mm bullet lodged in his right shoulder, the injuries were classified as slight in nature. The accused, Steven Azzopardi, was granted bail upon arraignment, pleading his innocence from the beginning. The firearm was never found. During the first session of the compilation of evidence a week after the shooting, Peter Azzopardi declared under oath that he did not want to testify against his son and that he had since forgiven him. His declaration meant the prosecution had to do without the testimony of the sole eyewitness of the alleged crime.   According to the Criminal Code, an alleged victim of an offence involving domestic violence may request the court to stay proceedings against the alleged perpetrator but the court may decide to carry on, considering the best interests of the complainant, any minors involved, and any other relevant third parties. The Attorney General’s office insisted that the case must continue and the accused must face a trial by jury. The compilation of evidence continued for six years, until all other prosecution witnesses testified, including police officers, scene-of-crime officers, forensic officers, court-appointed experts, medical and ballistic experts. When the prosecution rested its case on Friday, defence lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri asked the court to stay proceedings, insisting that if the prosecution’s only eyewitness was still refusing to testify, going before a jury was going to be a futile exercise. Magistrate Micallef Stafrace upheld the request, ruling that it was amply clear that Peter Azzopardi, even in the presence of his lawyer, wanted the case against his son to stop here. She therefore ruled that the case against Steven Azzopardi had been extinguished and cleared him of all the charges brought against him. Police Inspector Roderick Spiteri prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. Lawyer David Gatt appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Robert Abela refuses to say whether he would accept Chris Cardona back,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Robert Abela would not say whether he would accept Chris Cardona back into the PL, after the former minister said on Monday he did not exclude a return to politics. Abela would only say that was a decision to be made if and when Cardona expressed interest in returning to the political scene. ""Chris Cardona made no such request to the party structures so this is all speculation, and I don't like to comment on speculations,"" he told reporters on Monday.  ""When that circumstance arises it will be dealt with within the party structures."" On Monday, former Labour deputy leader Chris Cardona, 51, said he would not rule out a return to politics. “I am a lifelong member of the PL. I’m still 51. Some people get into politics at an older age. I did a run of 30 years (with the party) - 25 of them in parliament - so I do not rule out a return to the political scene,” he told Times of Malta. Cardona was forced to step down as deputy leader after being named in connection with Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder. He denies any involvement in the assassination. The return to politics of former Labour officials has been dominating headlines since Abela seemed to open his arms to Rosianne Cutajar, Justyne Caruana and Joseph Musat last month, with speculation arising over who else could be welcomed back to the party after they were forced to resign. Abela was coy, however, when asked whether he would allow former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and Cardona back into the Labour Party. Each case had to be judged on its merits, Abela said in a recent interview as he avoided a definitive answer. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

PM says sovereignty of majority should also be respected in President's choice,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Updated 8pm with PN comments Robert Abela said he was convinced he could reach a sensible agreement with the opposition if they put their heads together on the nomination of a new President of the Republic, but stopped short of saying that in case of an impasse, the government should enjoy the upper hand. ""I'm convinced I can sit down with Grech and find an agreement in good faith,"" the prime minister said, fielding questions from reporters on Monday.  ""Indeed, the two-thirds majority rule is now entrenched [in the constitution], but the constitutional reform must respect the equally important principle of democracy - meaning the sovereignty of the majority of the people must be respected as well. ""I'm not imposing any position. I'm absolutely not, and my message is clear. But that principle must be respected.""   It is unclear whether Abela and Bernard Grech have begun discussing who would succeed George Vella on April 4, and on Monday Abela would not even confirm whether talks had begun. The proposed names and the talks were to remain completely confidential, and it was wrong for any side to attempt to score political points by disclosing the details of the process, the prime minister said. ""Both Dr Grech and I are agreeing that for a mature discussion to happen, we must respect confidentiality and that nobody should capitalise off the process,"" he said. ""There are still some weeks to go till April 4 and I've already said what qualities I want in the next president, and I believe that if we discuss it seriously, we can reach an agreement."" Last month, Grech told Times of Malta that he was yet to hear from Abela on when they would start discussing the new contender for the country's highest role. He would also not disclose the names the Opposition was planning on putting forward. Following recent constitutional changes, Malta's next president will need to be appointed by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members of the House of Representatives. All previous presidents only needed to be nominated by simple majority after being proposed by the government. This will be the first time that both sides of the House have to agree on a name. President George Vella's five-year term ends on April 1 and cannot be renewed. The government, can, however, nominate an acting president until agreement is reached on a successor. PN reacts Reacting to Abela's comments, the PN said in a statement that both sides of the House needed to agree on the next President of Malta.  Neither side can dictate what will happen, arbitrarily, before discussions even kick off, the party said. ""The PN's position remains clear. The President should be a person who unites the Maltese and Gozitans, irrespective of where they come from."" You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"January passenger movement at MIA exceeds 400,000 mark for first time since 2020",Times of Malta,"Over 465,480 people travelled through the Malta International Airport last month - exceeding the 400,000-passenger mark in January for the first time since the COVID pandemic shuttered airports in 2020.  The MIA said in a statement passenger movements in the first month of the year registered an upswing of 22.7 per cent over 2023, with traffic peaking on January 6. The day brought the hectic holiday travel season to a close, as 151 flights carried 23,923 passengers to and from MIA. Aircraft movement totalled 3,511 in January, corresponding to a 23.4 per cent growth when compared with the same month in 2023. While seat capacity increased by 27.4 per cent over the reference year, load factor registered a drop of 2.8 percentage points, as average occupancy on flights stood at 74 per cent.   The top driver of traffic for January was Italy (+24 per cent over 2023) with a market share of almost 23 per cent, followed by the United Kingdom (+23 per cent), Poland (+59 per cent), Germany (+30 per cent) and France (-20 per cent).  The most significant growth was observed in the Polish market, which has continued to grow steadily over the past years, overtaking Spain, France and Germany to become MIA’s third-largest market in January 2024. Improved frequencies on flights to Polish destinations operated by Ryanair and Wizz Air for the winter season led the market to grow by 59 per cent year-on-year, with the Polish market accounting for some 10% per cent of all passenger movements last month.

Court slams Mark Gaffarena 'cowboy attitude' with farmers leasing his land,Edwina Brincat,"A court told Mark Gaffarena his rights were not breached when he claimed he could not enjoy his Burmarrad property as it was leased to a family of farmers, slamming the businessman's ""cowboy-like attitude"" and referring to him as a ""speculator"". The court declared on Monday that Gaffarena could not claim that his fundamental rights were breached by current laws regulating protected leases since he knew that the Burmarrad property he purchased was leased and precisely because of that had only paid 6% of its real value. There was nothing wrong with “fair speculation” but the court deplored the “cowboy-like attitude"" towards the tenant who testified that, ever since Gaffarena took over the property as landlord, he was threatened with eviction, said Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey.  In a strongly-worded judgment delivered on Monday, the court threw out Gaffarena's bid to seek compensation for the alleged breach of his fundamental right to property and protection against discrimination in terms of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The case revolved around property consisting of a farmhouse and some 15,000 square metres of land at Burmarrad in an area known as Ta’ Lippin which Gaffarena bought in 2003 through a contract published by Notary Carmelo Mangion.  That deed of sale explicitly stated that the property was subject to a lease and in fact, that condition was reflected in the price.  Gaffarena bought the property for Lm30,000, equivalent to €69,881 at the time when the real market value of the property was just over €1 million.  When fielding questions by the court in the constitutional proceedings, Gaffarena admitted he had clinched the deal at a far low price.  He subsequently instituted a case before the First Hall, Civil Court claiming that, given the current legal framework on protected leases, he had no real hope of regaining full ownership of the property and could not make any real gains on the lease.  He claimed that the property was now valued at €3.5 million.  Moreover, he argued that the farmhouse was in a neglected state and that the couple who rented the property, together with the adjacent land, no longer lived there.  Gaffarena claimed to have kept a lookout over several days and never saw anyone enter the farmhouse. Nor were there any lights on at night.  The tenant had inherited other property and therefore could move elsewhere, argued the landlord, pointing out that, according to the electoral register, the couple’s registered address was not at the farmhouse. He was being paid a miserable €191.56 annual rent for the farmhouse and a further €111.81 annual rent for the agricultural land. That was far less than the market value, complained Gaffarena.  The tenant - Joseph Briffa - testified that he had lived at the farmhouse all his life and had raised his own family there. He came from a generation of farmers and was a full-time farmer himself, selling his produce at the market.  He never had any trouble with the previous landlord but all that changed when Gaffarena acquired the property.  Founder of Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi Malcolm Borg also testified, highlighting the importance of agriculture and warning that the food supply chain was currently under threat.  He knew the Briffa couple who were full-time farmers living at the Burmarrad farmhouse.  When all was considered, the court upheld one of the pleas raised by the State Advocate, namely that Gaffarena was well aware of the rent on the property he acquired.  He was not the original owner nor one of the heirs but had bought the farmhouse and lands at a considerably lower price.  A simple calculation showed that he gained far more than he could have received in rent on the open market. The savings on the purchase price were twice the amount Gaffarena could have received in rent, observed the judge. And the court would not permit Gaffarena to seek further compensation from the State.  If the court were to allow that, it would not only be permitting an injustice but also an “insult against society which pays taxes for the better administration of the common good.” “This court will certainly not permit such abuse,” concluded the judge, throwing out Gaffarena’s claims, observing that as a speculator he did not “instantaneously” qualify as a victim whose fundamental rights were allegedly breached.

PM denies failing to declare Xewkija property,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The Prime Minister on Monday denied failing to declare a property he bought in Xewkija and insisted he paid for it via a cheque and ""not a cent in cash"". Robert Abela was reacting to a story published on The Shift News on Sunday. According to The Shift, he refused to explain a €180,000 discrepancy in his personal wealth declarations presented to parliament last year after he failed to declare a plot of land bought in Xewkija in 2022. The Shift also said the €180,000 he forked out to buy the land was not reflected in his 2022 declaration of assets. On the contrary, it appears his income increased from the previous year, without having sold any other property he owns and without having declared any new source of income except his prime ministerial salary. Former book council chair Mark Camilleri had originally published a series of blog posts in November saying Abela bought more than €300,000 worth of land in Gozo ""with undeclared capital"" and that he paid for them through his wife's BOV bank account. Abela did declare he owns a property in Xewkija in both the 2021 and 2022 declarations of assets. However, The Shift claimed it was referring to a separate property.   Fielding Times of Malta questions on Monday, Abela insisted it was the same property bought through several contracts. ""It is the same property that was bought through several contracts - one property next to another - this was declared most clearly,"" he said. ""What I declared was in complete conformity with the declaration of assets rules. I paid for it via cheque and I did not pay a cent in cash."" Every year, MPs are bound to divulge their financial assets – from the properties they own to the bank loans they hold. Earlier on Monday, independent candidate Arnold Cassola asked the Standards Commissioner to investigate Abela over the news story. ""Since the Prime Minister is not gifted with the magical talents of Houdini, it would be wise for him to explain to the Maltese taxpayer the origins of his 'unexplained wealth'."" Abela hit out at Cassola, saying he was pulling one of his usual acts of devaluing the seriousness of the Standards Commissioner's office. Cassola's report is ""baseless and unfounded"", Abela said. ""The irony is that Cassola dreams up these complaints against me and my colleagues every week, and then, when the Commissioner decides to throw away his complaint, he complains that I am controlling the Commissioner."" In both his 2021 and 2022 declarations, Abela declared three properties: an apartment in Marsascala and properties in Żejtun and Xewkija. He also holds over €388,000 in savings split across five accounts in three local banks. Abela’s portfolio of financial holdings grew significantly from 2021 to 2022, gaining additional government shares worth €20,000. He continues to hold stakes in Hili Properties plc and HSBC Bank Malta. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"€120,000: David Walliams' fee to host the Malta Film Awards",Giulia Magri,"British comedian and author David Walliams was paid a whopping €120,000 to host the Malta Film Awards back in January 2022, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation announced. After a two-year legal battle, last month, a judge ordered the Malta Film Commission to reveal how much it paid Walliams for the lavish film awards. ""A two-year legal battle with the Malta Film Commission to get a single invoice,"" the Daphne foundation posted on its social media channels. It called on the government to be completely transparent with its spending and make access to information less arduous. The fee given to Walliams is practically double the figure earned by Prime Minister Robert Abela for an entire year. Officially, the prime minister receives a yearly salary of €63,000. On Monday, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation posted that Walliams was paid 30 per cent of the original Film Awards budget of €400,000.   It later emerged that the Malta Film Week cost taxpayers a total of €1.3 million, yet details on how the public funds had been spent are under wraps. ""This means that nearly 10 per cent of the total amount was spent on just the host of the show: David Walliams... Where did the rest of the €1.3 million go?"" The commission had denied a Times of Malta Freedom of Information request for details on the cost of the glitzy awards.  It also denied a Freedom of Information request filed by the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation specifically requesting payments made to Walliams. In the rejection letter, the film commission had cited a legal clause that the requested documents were subject to professional privilege and that their disclosure would amount to breach of confidence. The foundation took the matter to the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) which ruled in its favour, leading to an appeal by the commission before the Data Protection Tribunal, which upheld the IDPC ruling. The IDPC said that the confidentiality clause in the agreement with Walliams could not be used to prevent disclosure of the amount he was paid and the Malta Film Commission had not attempted to explain or substantiate its claim that disclosing the requested invoice would prejudice its affairs or those of Walliams. Following the Data Protection Commissioner’s ruling, the Film Commission took the matter to the civil court, asking it to annul the ruling and revoke the IDPC decision. Yet, the court rejected the film commission's second appeal, ordering the commission to release the information. The Malta Film Commission has repeatedly been in the headlines for its extravagant spending and the overly generous rebates given to overseas film productions.  Earlier on Monday, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said the financial details regarding the Mediterranee Film Festival, which took place last year, were set to be announced too. The festival saw actors and producers flown to Malta, put in five-star hotels and treated to yacht trips and a black-tie gala film awards event at Fort Manoel, which was also hosted by Walliams. Top industry insiders told Times of Malta that the extravagant event cost taxpayers more than a million euros. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Lawyer describes 20-minute wait to speak to domestic violence unit,Giulia Magri,"A lawyer has described how she spent almost 20 minutes waiting on a call to the legal office of the police's Domestic Violence Prosecution Unit to try to file a protection order for a client. Marita Pace Dimech shared a screenshot of her call with the Prosecution Office at the Domestic Violence Prosecution Unit. The number is not the number used by victims to report a crime. “This is the precarious situation domestic violence victims face every day,” she wrote on Facebook on Monday. “As soon as you manage to speak to someone, they will refer you to another person, and back and forth. The operator will tell you to try another time, but trying another time could be too late.” The Prosecutions Unit assumes various functions connected with legal matters.   Speaking to Times of Malta, Pace Dimech explained that she has been trying to reach out to the Prosecution Office since January 22 to file a protection order for her client.  Pace Dimech said she requested a protection order prior to the hearing of such a case, as she believes the hearing could take place in 2025. When she previously tried to call the office, the line would be engaged or she would have to wait for operators to transfer her call to another office. “I reached out to the Prosecution Office to know the date of the First court hearing for my client, so that I can request a protection order, but every time I tried to call, the line would be engaged, or else the operator would tell me to try again later,” she said. On Monday, Pace Dimech said she spent over 20 minutes on the line and tried to call the number another three times before getting through to an operator. ""I took to social media to post about the situation so people understand the reality victims face and that while there have been improvements, there is still a lot more work to be done."" A police spokesperson confirmed that the telephone line for the DV Prosecution Office is facing ""technical issues"" but that all other helplines are operating. ""If a victim wants to make a report, they can still do so, as all the other lines are operating,"" he said. ""Kindly note that the Emergency numbers dedicated to the victims of domestic violence are 22942777 and 22942717."" Helplines such as emergency lines 112, and 119 are still operating. Victims can also contact the Police Gender-Based Domestic Violence unit at 27172777 and Aġenzija Apoġġ at 22959000. Detailed information, including contact details for the Police Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit, can be found in the 'Handbook for Victims Abuse' found in police officers, the newly launched DV hub in Santa Luċija, and from the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit of the Police headquarters in Floriana. Pace Dimech was the lawyer of femicide victim Bernice Cassar, who was shot dead on her way to work in November 2022. Her estranged husband Roderick Cassar has been charged with the femicide and is pleading not guilty. She was awaiting a court hearing at the time of her murder and had filed multiple police reports against her ex-husband. Days before she was killed, Pace Dimech pleaded with the police to take action against her ex-husband for breaching a protection order. An inquiry into the murder concluded the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother-of-two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.

Judge orders Elon Musk to answer to regulators in Twitter/X probe,Times of Malta,"A US judge has ordered Elon Musk to comply with a subpoena to answer questions from regulators about his purchases of Twitter shares last year. The order comes after Musk, who beefed up his stake in Twitter -- now called X -- before buying the company for $44 billion, did not show up for a scheduled deposition in September with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to a legal filing. ""The court grants the SEC's application to enforce the subpoena,"" the decision by California judge Laurel Beeler, published on Saturday and seen by AFP, stated.  The billionaire boss and the SEC now have a week to agree on a time and place for Musk to give testimony, it added. The SEC investigation pertains to all of Musk's purchases of Twitter stock in 2022 as well as his statements and filings with market regulators, court documents stated. Musk took part in two half-day depositions in July with the SEC, which told the court it has since received ""thousands of documents"" that have raised questions they want him to answer. Musk's objections to the latest deposition included an accusation that the SEC is using its power to ""harass"" him, the commission said in the filing. ""The SEC has already taken Mr. Musk's testimony multiple times in this misguided investigation -- enough is enough,"" Musk attorney Alex Spiro said in reply to an AFP inquiry. But the SEC had argued that ""Musk's ongoing refusal to comply with the SEC's administrative subpoena is hindering and delaying the SEC staff's investigation to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred,"" according to court documents. Musk's role at the social network has been marked by numerous controversies and led to various legal actions on the part of investors, former employees and companies that had contracts with Twitter.  Shareholders, for example, have filed a lawsuit against Musk, accusing him of disclosing his five percent stake in Twitter too late, after the deadline set by the SEC.

Court throws out breach of rights claim by one of Europe's most wanted fugitives,Edwina Brincat,"A court has thrown out a breach of rights claim by convicted explosives importer Jomic Calleja Maatouk, currently still one of Europe’s most wanted fugitives.  The man was handed a five-year effective term of imprisonment last July, in a judgment handed down by a Magistrates’ Court, describing him as a “lethal weapon” ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk appealed that decision and was out on bail pending final judgment. However, soon after, Calleja and his wife went missing. The couple were subsequently targeted by a European Arrest Warrant and placed on Europol’s list of most wanted fugitives.  While criminal proceedings against him were still pending before the Magistrates’ Courts, Calleja Maatouk had flagged a constitutional issue concerning the disclosure of information by the prosecution.  Police had pressed charges against him for allegedly importing explosives purchased on the dark web after obtaining intelligence pointing investigators in his direction.  When asked how that information had been obtained from the dark web, superintendent George Cremona had testified that “it was irrelevant”.  The presiding Magistrate agreed, pointing out that if that information was police intelligence, then the superintendent could not testify about it.  The accused’s lawyer asked for full disclosure, but the request was rejected.  A subsequent request for a constitutional reference was also turned down by the court in an “exhaustive and well reasoned” decree delivered by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech in March 2022 which concluded that the request was “frivolous and vexatious.”  That was when Calleja Maatouk filed separate constitutional proceedings claiming that the lack of full disclosure breached the accused’s fundamental rights.  The relative provision under the Criminal Court regulating disclosure did not provide “an independent mechanism”. Rather than have the court decide whether a particular piece of information was intelligence or otherwise, the matter was placed in the hands of the police and the Attorney General who were interested parties in the proceedings.  Calleja Maatouk’s lawyer referred to the more “just and fair” procedure adopted under the US and Dutch systems when compared to the system adopted under Maltese law, arguing that the latter was defective.  There were “blatant loopholes” which resulted in a breach of the accused’s fundamental rights, argued lawyer Benjamin Valenzia.  Such lack of full disclosure meant that Calleja Maatouk could not provide a valid defence.  When delivering judgment on Monday, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction observed that the issue which formed the subject matter of the case was “identical” to that which had been decreed upon by the Magistrates’ Court.  Yet, even though the Magistrate had concluded that the claim was “simply frivolous and vexatious”, Calleja Maatouk had proceeded with separate constitutional proceedings.  Citing case law on this matter, Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey concluded that the applicant’s claim was null, declaring that the court would not pronounce itself on a matter that had already been declared “frivolous and vexatious” by another court.

People are realising it's time to change government - Bernard Grech,Mark Laurence Zammit,"People have come to understand the government will not change the economic model that has caused overcrowding in the country so they are realising their only solution is to change the government, Bernard Grech said on Sunday. The country's economic prosperity is based solely on the growing population and Robert Abela is too afraid to address that problem, even though everyone agrees Malta should change its economic model, the PN leader said in an interview on the party's television station. ""That is the solution people have - to change government - and that is where we come in,"" he said. ""If you feel suffocated in construction, traffic, failing infrastructure, crippling hospital services, out-of-stock medicines and the rising cost of living, Abela cannot give you the solution you need. The longer he remains in government, the bigger the population is going to get and the bigger the problem.""   Grech made no mention of a MaltaToday poll published on Sunday that showed PN trailed PL by 15,000 votes in next June's elections, that people still trusted Abela far more than they trusted him, and that even a majority of PN voters distrust him. Grech acknowledged Labour's economic vision was a success but only to the detriment of the environment, people's quality of life, people's freedom to live peacefully. Crime had risen and a sense of insecurity in the community had increased. ""Abela is afraid of addressing the problem he created himself, and he won't solve the issues as long as he continues to hold on to the current economic model,"" he said. The government is also afraid to do the right thing when it comes to good governance, Grech said. On the contrary, it seems set on doing the wrong things, by welcoming back the people who were forced to resign because of wrongdoings. ""Abela has not only thrown out good governance but he has now resorted to attacking the courts and the magistrates because he can't control them,"" he said. ""And Abela does that. He lashes out at whoever he can't control, like he lashes out at us because we speak out against filthy governance."" A PN government would focus on environmental administration, he said, which would find the much-needed balance between development and environmental protection. While aspiring to increase economic prosperity, the PN wanted to incentivise the private sector to understand it has responsibilities towards society and to push forward the party's vision of excellence. A PN government would then be able to upgrade infrastructure and the hospitals, among others, he added. ""A PN government would be the strong pair of hands that could address the needs of your family,"" he told viewers. He said the government was also unable to effectively address the rising cost of living, first by blaming inflation on the war and the pandemic, and then by introducing a half-baked measure that has not solved the problem of high supermarket bills and does not address the problem at the source. A PN government would stop taxing the cost of living adjustment (COLA), give tax credits to employers and create a national fund to help importers and exporters.

Latvia's president: ‘Weaponised migration helped us understand Malta’,James Cummings,"Latvia’s head of state said the use of migration as a weapon by one of its neighbours increased his country’s understanding of the migratory challenges facing Malta. In a wide-ranging interview, Edgars Rinkēvičs said Belarus’ decision to send migrants over its border with Latvia had led to greater understanding compared to a decade ago. “When there was a migration wave back in 2015 and 2016, when the EU was really divided, many people were saying that southern members of the EU should guard their borders better,” explained Rinkēvičs. “Then we got [Belarusian President Aleksandr] Lukashenko’s use of migration as a hybrid weapon,” he said. “So, when we got there, I think that our understanding of all those challenges the Mediterranean region faces – [although] that’s a different set of challenges – has grown.”   In 2021, Lukashenko threatened to flood Europe with “drugs and migrants” in response to looming EU sanctions after Belarus diverted a Lithuania-bound flight and seized dissident Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich. Soon after, the country began to send thousands of Middle Eastern and Asian migrants across its borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, a move described by the European Commission at the time as a “gangster-style approach”. Rinkēvičs, a former foreign minister, said that in the face of such pressures, the bloc’s asylum policy inevitably had to change. “Nobody imagined that migration could be used as a weapon. But we also acknowledge the need to address the migration issues raised by countries here in this [Mediterranean] region,” he said, admitting a solution is not easy. In a meeting with Rinkēvičs in November, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called Latvia a “highly valued” member of the organisation, describing it as “leading by example on defence spending”. And since 2017, the country has hosted a NATO battlegroup alongside Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. Since then, Russia has invaded Ukraine, taking a war to Europe’s doorstep, and sparking fear in the Baltic states, especially. How does Rinkēvičs respond to claims that such a military presence could provoke Russia and possibly make a confrontation more likely? “This argument that NATO’s presence provokes Russia is wrong. NATO’s presence actually deters Russia,” he said. Pointing to Russia’s attack on Georgia in 2008 and its annexing of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, Rinkēvičs instead argued for an increased NATO presence. “Yes, we do say that we need more. Being part of NATO – and the Ukrainian example is very good here – protects you and protects peace,” he said, adding the numbers of alliance troops in the Baltic states were planned to increase. However, while strong in his stance on Russia, Rinkēvičs would not be drawn into advocating for Malta to abandon its constitutional neutrality in the face of Russian aggression, instead saying it was up to the Maltese to define the limits of such a stance. “I think that Malta has proven that it can be very vocal voice for international law... but where that concept goes, that’s up to the people of Malta to decide.” Rinkēvičs was speaking to Times of Malta during a state visit to Malta, where he met with President George Vella and senior politicians, including Prime Minister Robert Abela and Foreign Minister Ian Borg. The visit included discussions around various areas of cooperation between the two countries, including their work in the field of translation. “Latvian and Maltese, both are so-called ‘small languages’. If you look at all the tools at our disposal, like Google Translate, big languages get great development – with smaller languages, it takes time,” he said. During his stay, Rinkēvičs visited Latvian technology company Tilde, which helped develop Maltese translation website traduzzjoni.mt. But despite such progress, Maltese has in the past been characterised as under threat, with proponents of the language fearing it is being eroded as English becomes increasingly common. Just last month, Census data revealed that a quarter of Maltese children under 10 years old grew up speaking English as their main language. Is this a challenge Latvia also faces? “If you talk with teenagers, you will probably get half of the sentence in Latvian and half in English – I think it’s very common for small nations and small languages,” he said, but added he was not so pessimistic about the fate of his mother tongue. “While you can’t say nothing is going to happen, you have to do whatever it takes to remind people that it is important to develop your language [as] it’s the core of your national identity. While Rinkēvičs is hopeful about the future of small languages, he is less allowing of a subset of Russian residents of his country who have failed to follow recent Latvian language requirements. In 2022, Latvia passed a law requiring all Russian citizens to pass a language proficiency test to stay in the country. And recently, international media said that thousands of Russians would be asked to leave Latvia.  “This is not accurate,” he said, explaining that while Latvia’s laws had been changed to require the language test, many Russian citizens had already passed while others who had failed had been given another two years to retake the exam. However, he stressed each person’s case was being assessed individually, with only those who hadn’t engaged with the law at all liable to face such action. But does Rinkēvičs concede that taking steps to expel citizens based on language could be seen as in conflict with EU values of freedom and social justice? “They are Russian citizens, so they have their own country of allegiance,” the president answered. “Every EU member state expects its own citizens, but also foreign citizens, to comply with legislation,” adding there were “high emotions” within Latvian society for Russians who had lived for years in the country without learning the language.

Developers applaud policy of stone façades for new Gozo buildings,Times of Malta,"Developers have applauded the decision by Gozo and Planning Minister Clint Camilleri to introduce a policy requiring stone facades in new buildings in Gozo.  In a statement published on Sunday, the Malta Development Association (MDA) however called for flexibility in the policy to allow for other aesthetically pleasing materials to be used. The MDA was referring to comments made by Camilleri who divulged information on the new policy in an interview with MaltaToday.  Camilleri said the policy will require new buildings to have a façade made out of stone, and the same rule will apply to the back of a building if this overlooks an ODZ area.  He said the policy aims to create buildings that are in tune with the traditional architectural characteristics of Gozitan villages, adding that the Planning Authority will issue a circular to this effect. The MDA said it recognises the importance of aligning individual policies with a broader government strategy for regional development.  “The imposition of stone facades in new buildings, as part of the government’s vision for Gozo, demonstrates a comprehensive approach to preserving the island’s architectural heritage while fostering economic growth and benefitting the community,” the statement read.  “By integrating this policy within the larger framework of the government’s vision for Gozo, stakeholders can work collaboratively to ensure that development initiatives are guided by principles of sustainability, cultural conservation and quality of life.” However, while the MDA praised the new policy, it also called for discussions to be held before its implementation on the supply of materials and the introduction of courses to produce skilled builders in Maltese stone. “While the introduction of stone facades is a significant step towards preserving Gozo’s architectural identity, it’s essential to recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach may not always be suitable,” the association said.  It said that the measure should allow a degree of flexibility to permit the proposal of facades with other materials in select localities, which would still be visually aesthetically pleasing as long as they respect the context of the surroundings.  “This approach can ensure that while preserving tradition, the island can also embrace innovation and contemporary design, enhancing its appeal to residents and visitors alike.” It ended the statement by applauding the ministry for its leadership in “advancing a holistic vision for the future of Gozo”.

"Today's front pages – February 11, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Sunday. The Sunday Times of Malta leads with the story of how scores of complaints against medical doctors and dentists risk not being investigated and permanently shelved, as the Medical Council of Malta freezes investigations. Publicly available information shows that the Medical Council is yet to conclude- and in some cases even start- investigations into scores of complaints.   The newspaper also reports that a man who has been living in Malta for 13 years, paid taxes, social security, and even started his own business, is at risk of being deported. The Malta Independent on Sunday reports on comments from Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi president Malcolm Borg who said former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s comments before the farmers' protest were “insensitive”.  It separately publishes Friends of the Earth Malta’s director, Martin Galea De Giovanni’s comments, that the national interest must supersede economic interests. MaltaToday leads its front with the paper’s survey on the European Parliament election, which shows that Labour starts the EP election race 15,000 votes ahead of the Nationalist Party.  Illum’s main story also reports MaltaToday’s European Parliament election survey, leading that faith in the Labour Party and Prime Minister Robert Abela has decreased since December. It claims that faith in the Nationalist Party leader, Bernard Grech has also plummeted.  Il-Mument reports that Prime Minister Robert Abela defends Marsascala’s deputy mayor, Janice Falzon, who the paper claims, is being investigated for drug abuse.  KullĦadd leads its front with an article about how Maltese families have a higher chance of becoming homeowners due to government schemes.

Labour MPs divided over Rosianne Cutajar’s return,Daniel Ellul,"Labour MPs are divided over Rosianne Cutajar’s return to the party as a decision by the executive over her future is expected shortly. While many MPs argue that Cutajar’s return will fire up Labour’s base for the European elections, others say the move could backfire. On Thursday, the PL parliamentary group discussed Cutajar’s possible return to the party. Although a majority agreed Cutajar should be brought back to the PL group, some expressed their reservations, sources present at the meeting told Times of Malta. One MP said that should Robert Abela persist and welcome back Cutajar it would be tantamount to a a “U-turn that makes him look weak”. “Maybe she shouldn’t have been removed in the first place, but once you make a decision, you should stick to it,” he said. Cutajar was moved out of cabinet in 2020 after Times of Malta revealed how she had benefitted from a property deal involving Yorgen Fenech, who faces charges of complicity in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Last April she resigned from the Labour parliamentary group after author and blogger Mark Camilleri leaked chats between her and Yorgen Fenech. She stayed on as an independent MP. But last month, Abela said Cutajar has paid a high enough political price and it is time for her position to be “reconsidered”. An MP who spoke on condition of anonymity said no one was being fooled by the argument that Cutajar had already “paid a price”. With Abela’s reasoning, what is stopping a return of Keith Schembri or Konrad Mizzi, the MP asked. “What I can’t understand is what the prime minister or the party is gaining from her return. Are we so desperate for votes?” “Abela opened a Pandora’s box, and I don’t know why,” he said. Another MP made a similar argument: “We are not in school where you are given a detention, and all is forgiven it,” he said.  RELATED STORIES  The MP said he could not understand why Abela, who had removed a number of people linked to allegations of corruption, was going back on his own policy.  He criticised Abela for publicly expressing his desire to bring back Cutajar before discussing it internally. “We can’t oppose her return now, can we?” said the MP, saying that a number of those who spoke in her favour at a meeting on Thursday were evidently doing so to echo Abela. One cabinet member said the Qormi MP brings a lot of baggage with her. “I saw a picture from the Nadur carnival where a group of revellers were dressed as pigs and with a person in the centre dressed as Rosianne. Why do we need this around us?” he asked. In the picture the person dressed as the Qormi MP held a placard reading “Kulħadd jitħanżer” (Everybody pigs out).  Cutajar had texted that phrase to her friend Yorgen Fenech, as she complained about being left out of cabinet. “I’ll become a consultant with Pierre of ITS and pocket another wage. I don’t care, everybody pigs out,” she had said. One MP said the PL needs to present a common front and not leave anyone in the dark. “We are stronger united,” he said. But MPs agreed that Cutajar remained popular with the party’s grassroots. The final decision on Cutajar’s return rests with Labour’s executive, Abela said last Thursday. That decision will come “in the near future,” he said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Watch: Richard Aquilina wins fourth edition of X Factor Malta,Giulia Magri,"Richard Aquilina has won the fourth edition of X Factor Malta, walking away with €50,000 in prize money.  Aquilina looked on in disbelief as he was named the winner on Saturday night, with judge and his mentor, Howard Keith Debono, embracing the 27-year-old singer.  The crowd erupted in applause and cheer as he was crowned as winner.  “Thank you, thank you from my heart,” he said. Aquilina was one of the four finalists who performed during Saturday night's final, alongside Amelia Kalabic, Lapes and Nadine, and Shanice. During yesterday’s live final show, Aquilina performed Half a Man, the same song he sang during his first audition in front of the judges back in October.   During his audition, Aquilina said he started singing back when he was young, but never performed in front of an audience. He stunned the judges immediately and was sent straight to Bootcamp following four yes' from the judges.  This year’s X Factor Malta made headlines earlier this week, after the elimination of two foreign competitors shocked viewers, with several claiming they were kicked out of the competition after a televoting audience favored Maltese semi-finalists.  Rose Marielle Mamaclay, a Filipino singer who has dominated the show for weeks, was eliminated during the semi-final last week, together with Sean Kamati, who is from Namibia. Yet, the singers insisted they had no hard feelings for those who did not vote for them.  “If people chose to vote for the others instead of me, I have no bitterness in my heart,” Mamaclay told Times of Malta earlier this week.  Kamati meanwhile said he was aware that people voted for those they knew. “I definitely thought I had the potential to win, but I am also aware that there was a possibility that I would not,” he said.  “I am not local, and coming from a small country myself, I know how things go. People vote for who they know. I don’t believe I was eliminated because the Maltese don’t like foreigners, but because my performance was not the best.”   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Gżira façade collapse was likely caused by excavator vibrations,Matthew Xuereb,"Ground vibrations during excavations on a Gżira construction site are believed to have caused the collapse of the façade and scaffolding on Tuesday, according to preliminary investigations. The evidence collected so far indicates the excavations caused the foundations to vibrate, bringing down the entire façade, sources close to the investigations told Times of Malta. The crash onto Triq Belvedere missed pedestrians by metres and once again reignited the discussion over the potential danger of the hundreds of construction sites dotted around Malta. Four separate bodies are investigating the incident: the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA), the police and a magisterial inquiry. Sources said the investigators are in the process of collecting CCTV footage from nearby security cameras to potentially shed more light on what could have triggered the incident. The footage would also determine the veracity of a claim that reached investigators that the scaffolding may have been hit by a passing truck. So far, none of the evidence has given credence to this theory. Multiple sources said the site had all permits and related documents in order.   A witness who happened to be walking told Times of Malta that he was roughly 10 metres away from the site when the scaffolding surrounding the building gave way and the masonry of the façade followed swiftly, crashing into the balcony of the house across the street and spilling into the street below. “I was listening to music on my headphones, but the sound of the crash was huge. There was dust billowing everywhere,” said the Gżira resident. The resident said the building has been in the same state for several months, with just a façade holding on for dear life. Developer Kris Calleja and architect Colin Zammit applied to demolish various properties on Triq Belvedere to build a hotel, which will include a new façade identical to the existing one, in the interest of “maintaining the visual rhythm” of the streetscape. According to publicly available documents, the Building and Construction Authority issued a stop notice just after the collapse, “except to render the site safe”. According to PA documents, the site technical officer is Pierre Farrugia, an architect who in 2019 was convicted of involuntary homicide when a young worker died in the reconstruction of the DB Seabank Hotel in Mellieħa. Farrugia has appealed the conviction, which is still pending. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

'I'm terrified': Man threatened with deportation after 13 years in Malta,Sarah Carabott,"Kusi Dismark was in his hair salon on High Street, Ħamrun, on a Sunday morning, cutting a client’s hair when the police showed up. He was arrested on the spot and taken to Safi detention centre, leaving a client mid-haircut and the doors to his shop – a business he built from scratch – wide open. And as he was driven away, Kusi saw the salon – Adamfo Pa in Twi, or Best Friend in English – for the last time. When Kusi arrived in Malta 13 years ago seeking asylum, he did not have a penny to his name. Once released from detention, he applied for a work permit and found employment with a local furniture maker. For years he worked, paid taxes and social security contributions, until he had saved enough to start a hairdressing course at MCAST. As a person who has been denied asylum, Kusi was allowed to work in Malta and pay his dues but had no access to free education and healthcare. Once he completed his studies, he opened a hair salon in Ħamrun in 2019 and was planning on expanding his business, when on January 21 he was suddenly arrested in his beloved shop and detained at Safi. Kusi, 37, says he has invested the best part of his life in a place that allowed him “to live, not just survive” – a place he could finally call “home”. Born in Ivory Coast, he moved with his mother to Ghana as a little boy where he worked in agriculture and dreamt of studying to become a hairdresser. After years of clashes with relatives that made it impossible for him to lead a safe and stable life he left for Europe and landed in Malta, where he says he “found the family he never had in Ivory Coast or Ghana”.   Kusi was speaking to Times of Malta from the Safi detention centre over a landline phone. His mobile phone – the only connection with the world outside the detention centre – has been confiscated. Friends, relatives and any legal councillors can call the detention centre, but most often, the line is busy. Times of Malta officially asked to visit him on February 2. On February 8, we were told a Detention Services Agency’s welfare officer spoke with Kusi who said he did not know anyone with that name. Times of Malta spoke to Kusi on the phone on February 6.  He said he has spent every waking hour since January 21 with the threat of deportation hanging over his head.   “When people used to ask me ‘how are you?’, I’d say ‘I’m great’: apart from the initial detention period, I’ve never had any issues with anyone in Malta. But now I cannot even say ‘I’m fine’. I keep thinking of my shuttered shop. My friends. My family. “I’m not mentally prepared to return. I will return empty-handed. I will have to start life from scratch again at 37 years of age. There’s only so many times one can try again at life. I cannot believe it. I cannot understand… I’m scared. Terrified,” he said, pausing. “My hope was Malta. I invested my hope, energy and ambition in a country that called me home.” According to a detention notification dated January 21, Kusi is being detained as he has been subject to a removal order since June of 2011, and he might be “forcibly removed from the Schengen area within the coming weeks”. Malta has a right to return people who are rejected protection. However, not all are repatriated. Some countries of origin fail to provide official documentation for those handed a removal order or refuse to recognise the migrants’ claimed nationality. Kusi’s sudden arrest and detention sent shockwaves among his circle of friends. A Maltese friend who has done business with Kusi in the past described him as “a gentleman” and “trustworthy, reliable and very respectful”. “All I can say is that he is a very honest man – you know where you stand with him. “For years, Kusi has contributed to Malta’s economy without expecting anything: he is not entitled to sick or vacation leave, or a pension. He is paying for our pension and is indirectly an asset to Malta. It is silly that we are trying to get rid of him when we need young people like him to bolster the country’s workforce.” One of Kusi’s Maltese landlords similarly cannot understand why a person who has lived in Malta and integrated so well within the community, could be sent away against his own will. “If we need more workers in Malta, we should keep people who, like Kusi, have been here for a long time, rather than ‘import’ other third-country nationals with no connection to the island.” Kusi, he said, always paid his rent on time and cared for the property like it was his own. A client of Kusi, also a Maltese national, cannot understand why Kusi is being denied a right to live in Malta after being good enough to be granted a work permit to pay tax. “Kusi is the kind of person who, rather than ask you to sit in front of the mirror and swivel you around for his comfort, while cutting your hair, would walk around you himself. “I’ve seen him ask his clients to excuse him while he helped elderly customers walk to the door and out of his shop. If he is repatriated, Malta will lose a very good man.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Complaints about doctor malpractice left to languish by Medical Council,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Scores of complaints against medical doctors and dentists risk not being investigated and permanently shelved, as the time bar clock ticks on probes frozen for months. Publicly available information reveals the Medical Council of Malta is yet to conclude – and in some cases even start – investigations into scores of complaints, ranging from minor ethical breaches to serious, surgery mishaps and child deaths. Sources close to government and the council said the body quietly and unofficially halted its investigations last year after a court ruled that its probing process was unfair against a doctor being investigated. Among the pending cases is one opened in 2021 after hospital staff found a surgical gauze lodged inside a mother who had just given birth via a caesarean operation. The woman filed a complaint against her doctor, alleging they left the gauze inside her during the operation. She said that initially the issue went unnoticed, until she returned home from hospital and began to feel severe pain, only to be rushed back to hospital where the gauze was removed from her body. The woman filed the complaint in February 2021 and within a month the medical council set up a board of inquiry to investigate the case. The inquiry is still pending. There is an ongoing court case and the doctor denies any wrongdoing. Similarly, a board of inquiry is yet to be initiated to investigate a separate report of a patient who complained of alleged sexual abuse by their doctor. The complaint was filed in July 2020.   What makes matters worse is that medical council cases are time-barred by law, which means enough time has elapsed for dozens of them to be dropped. They were permanently archived without ever reaching a conclusion, and others risk facing the same fate.  According to the Healthcare Professions Act, which regulates the work of the medical council, any inquiry must be concluded within a period of two years from when it is opened and any case shall be time-barred after two years from when the complainant becomes, or ought to have become aware, of the incident. In other cases that are currently also pending in court - as in the case of the surgical gauze - the prescription period is interrupted, meaning they are not at imminent risk of being time-barred and will likely be dealt with after the court cases are decided. Questions sent to the medical council remained unanswered. The Medical Council of Malta regulates the medical and dentistry professions and registers new medical practitioners while safeguarding patients’ rights and safety. One of its functions is to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against medical professionals and also has the legal power to issue fines, suspend warrants and even strike professionals off the register. The council receives around a few dozen complaints every year and, when functioning, often starts its own investigations based on news stories, for instance. But its latest available annual report reveals it has pending complaints that go back as far as 10 years which are yet to be started. Others are still ongoing or waiting for the board of investigation to be set up. One case filed in October 2015 “is still being explored”. All investigations were frozen last year, sources close to government and the council confirmed, after a constitutional court ruled the council was acting as judge, jury and prosecutor when it investigated PN MP and physician Stephen Spiteri for allegedly issuing medical certificates without examining patients. The judge threw out the investigation last June, saying Spiteri’s rights to a fair hearing were breached because the council’s multiple functions – from investigation to prosecution and issuing penalties – made it a “classic case of a structural lack of objective impartiality”. But that was essentially how all reported allegations have always been treated and carried out by the council, and sources said the judgment set a precedent for all the other cases, practically disempowering the council from pursuing any investigation further. Sources said the council fears any investigation it pursues will trigger legal proceedings similar to Spiteri’s. “After that judgment, the council lost the appetite to continue investigations, and the lack of resources and the burnout of overworked council members did not help either,” one government source said. “The council had also paused hearings during the beginning of the pandemic, which set the backlog even further.” The only way to solve the impasse is by amending the law to allow the council to work within a more clearly defined investigative framework. Sources said the medical council has been pushing MPs for it for months, and unless it is changed, pursuing any investigation is futile. If a solution is not found rapidly enough, the medical council’s proceedings against former Labour MP and family doctor Silvio Grixti might also eventually risk being time-barred. Last September, Times of Malta revealed Grixti has been implicated in a years-long racket to help hundreds of people fraudulently receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to. Evidence indicates the popular family doctor provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive social benefits averaging €450 monthly for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. The medical council had opened an investigation into the case, only for Grixti to reply via his lawyers, quoting Stephen Spiteri’s case and vowing to ignore the “unconstitutional” investigation. “Unless the law is changed as soon as possible, this will continue to happen,” one source said. “Following Spiteri’s court judgment, the council is literally unable to investigate any case further, because anything it does could be – and will likely be – challenged by medical practitioners as unconstitutional.” Legal sources said that to avoid a judge, jury and prosecutor situation in the future, the law could allow for an independent body to be set up to take decisions on complaints filed against a doctor. The council could still retain the power to receive the complaints, process them and investigate them but it would then need to pass the case on to the independent body which would be tasked with delivering a ruling and decide on any sanctions, if necessary. The amended law would also allow a doctor who is found guilty to take the case to a court of appeal. Questions on plans to amend the law were also sent to the Ministry of Health.

Metsola pushes for more investment to help businesses in green transition,Times of Malta,"The European Union and its member states must set clear targets and incentives if businesses are to invest in the green transition, Roberta Metsola believes. Speaking during a visit to Malta’s largest pharmaceutical company, Metsola argued that the European Green Deal is as much about security and ensuring competitiveness as it is about sustainability. “If we invest in the know-how, technology and foster development of skills necessary for the twin transition, we will gain the competitive edge,” she said. Metsola was in Malta on an official state visit as European Parliament president. During that visit, she met with staff and management of Teva Pharmaceuticals at the Bulebel Industrial Estate. With 514 employees, Teva is the largest company in Malta’s pharmaceutical sector. The company manufactures around 3,600 products worldwide, with people in around 60 countries using those products, which include generic pharmaceuticals. Metsola said that the EU’s single market was one of its greatest advantages. “We should build on it without fragmenting it. We do not need to fence ourselves in. Our economy has grown over the years precisely because we stood for the opposite.” she added. The European Green Deal, approved in 2020, is a series of policy initiatives introduced by the EU to make the 27-member bloc climate-neutral by 2050. It has been praised as ambitious by some and criticised as being overly rigid by others. Metsola is on record saying that parts of the deal may not take into consideration the social and economic impacts they will have. Following EU-wide protests by farmers, she said that more must be done to “ease the transition” and ensure nobody is left behind by the changes.

Three tonnes of oranges and lemons sent back to Sicily over virus fears,Times of Malta,"More than three tonnes of oranges, lemons and mandarines imported from Sicily were blocked from entering Malta early on Saturday morning, the agriculture ministry said. The 3,033kg of citrus fruits was packed into 306 boxes and brought to Malta via the catamaran.  It was returned after inspectors noted that the fruit was packed together with leaves and stems, in violation of pest control rules.    The Plant Health Directorate will also be seeking to sanction the importer, in line with the Plant Quarantine Act. Citrus trees are vulnerable to a variety of pests, with the Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) being among the most dangerous. CTV is present all across the globe and impacts all citrus trees. The virus cannot be controlled by any pesticide, and the only control mechanism for this disease is that of uprooting and burning infected trees and applying pesticides for the vectors. Malta has seen a number of CTV outbreaks in the past decade, with one of the largest dating back to 2017.  To reduce the risk of allowing the virus into Malta, all imported citrus fruit must be free of all leaves or stems. “Inspections are carried out to ensure organisms that can harm local plants are not allowed into the country and given the chance to spread,” the agriculture ministry said on Saturday in a statement. “The illegal trade of citrus fruit that does not conform with Maltese laws places local agriculture at risk. The interception of this fruit is a testament to the government’s commitment to protect local farmers and consumers,” the ministry said. Anyone who suspects fruit or vegetables are being illegally imported can contact the Plant Health Directorate on plantquarantine@gov.mt or 22926535.

Rosianne Cutajar's 'everybody pigs out' inspires Nadur carnival satire,Times of Malta,"Rosianne Cutajar’s notorious “everybody pigs out” remark made a return to the public eye this weekend, as a drove of pigs danced down Nadur’s streets for its annual carnival. Led by a person dressed up as the Qormi MP, revellers wearing identical pig costumes danced the night away while waving €50, €100 and €500 notes. Their leader held a placard reading “Kulħadd jitħanżer” (Everybody pigs out).   Cutajar had texted that phrase to her friend Yorgen Fenech back in 2019, as she complained about being left out of cabinet. “Now I’ve stopped giving a damn,” she told Fenech. “I’ll become a consultant with Pierre of ITS, and pocket another wage.”  Cutajar then added: “I don’t care, everybody pigs out.”    Text messages between Cutajar and Fenech were made public by author Mark Camilleri on his blog. Cutajar dropped a libel suit against Camilleri this week. A National Audit Office investigation into Cutajar's ITS job concluded that it was most likely fake.  Despite that damning report, Cutajar is now poised to be brought back to the Labour camp: Prime Minister Robert Abela has said that her one-year exile from the party’s parliamentary group is punishment enough and the party’s MPs met this week to discuss allowing her back into the parliamentary group. The satirical take on Cutajar’s comment was among the most eye-catching at this year’s Nadur carnival, a darkly comical and satirical street festival that contrasts with the family-friendly celebrations held in Valletta. Elsewhere in Nadur, other revellers took aim at Benna’s hike in milk prices with a carnival float lampooning the company, while others danced around a makeshift ambulance while holding a placard calling for authorities to “legalajs kokajn” (‘Legalise cocaine’).     In Valletta, carnival celebrations got into full swing on Saturday as dance troupes lit up the capital city with their colourful dances and choreographies, for the annual children's carnival.  A morning programme will resume on Sunday at 10 am.  Another carnival parade will take to the streets of Valletta starting on Monday morning and going on into the evening, culminating in a grand finale on Tuesday, February 13, down St Anne’s Street in Floriana.

Psychologists secure new sectoral agreement,Times of Malta,"Psychologists working within the public sector have secured a new five-year sectoral agreement, their association announced on Saturday. The Malta Chamber of Psychologists said the deal builds on the preceding one and would improve working conditions for public sector psychologists while also helping to address the lack of such professionals within the public service. ""Individuals who make use of mental health services in hospitals, community, and specialised clinics, correctional services, and schools will benefit,"" said MCP President Gail Debono. ""As the number of psychologists entering public service grows, so too will the availability of mental health services for the Maltese population."" Debono thanked negotiators from both sides. ""Although negotiations lasted over a year, meetings were held in an atmosphere of continuous respect, and it was clear from the start that all parties aimed to reach an agreement that fulfilled the needs of all,"" she said. ""All parties were ready to listen and understand better the necessities of the psychology profession, and this led to the positive outcome we have today."" Representatives of the Ministry for Health and Active Ageing led negotiations on the government side.

'Feliċ will have two days of fame': Man tells friends he shared viral sex video,Edwina Brincat,"A man accused of filming a fellow diner having sex with a woman at the Luqa boċċi club allegedly owned up to sharing the video without the couple’s consent but shrugged it off saying “Feliċ will have his two days of fame”.  Mark Cachia Zammit, a 35-year-old delivery man from Birżebbuġa, posted that comment in a Messenger group chat after a video of a sex scene, filmed during an evening meal, went viral on Facebook.  The whole episode landed Cachia Zammit in court  facing criminal charges as the prime suspect behind the filming and non-consensual sharing of the footage, with his table companions being summoned as eyewitnesses.  Cachia Zammit’s lawyers are claiming that he lacked criminal intent since he never meant to harm the alleged victims who had “tacitly consented” to the filming.  When the proceedings resumed this week, two of the accused’s friends who witnessed the unfolding of events that evening both appeared to agree that Feliċ “did what he did freely” and appeared to “enjoy the attention” of his table companions.  One of the witnesses recalled arriving last at the venue that September evening. He had been invited along by Cachia Zammit and when he got there, the rest of the group were already seated, waiting for dinner to be served.  Feliċ and the woman were sitting next to each other “chatting normally”. Grabbing a drink at the bar, he waited until starters were followed by the main course and then joined the others at the table, sitting at one end, facing the bar.  “Everybody was chatting in smaller groups at the table,” explained the witness, who said that he was on his mobile phone while eating. He suddenly heard shouting.  “Feliċ and the woman were dancing intimately with their clothes on... Feliċ was enjoying the attention he was getting,” as others at the table egged him on, he explained. The couple returned to their seats and but went back to their dancing, their movements “getting more and more intimate”.  “Feliċ appeared to be holding back while she egged him on, removing his clothes,” said the witness, stressing that at that moment he chose to focus on his food.  The woman led Feliċ towards a billiards table, that had been shifted to make space for their gathering, “and they had sex there” to shouts of “come on Feliċ! You’re king!”. The witness was not pleased with the unexpected turn of events.  “I went there to eat and ended up in all this. I had thought it would just be a meal, a drink and then back home. I have a girlfriend,” explained the witness, annoyed by the hassle that the meal with friends had landed him in.  Another eyewitness testified that the couple “seemed to know each other”. The woman - a stranger to the witness - had allegedly joined the party of male friends on their way into the club.  “They ended up entwined (gew kobba), hugging and kissing,” said the witness. And as the situation grew more intimate, so did the comments.  Asked who was behind those comments, the witness said that he “recognised the voice of Mark Cachia Zammit”.  Given the angle of filming of the video which ended up on social media, the witness claimed that the person filming must have been Cachia Zammit.  When the footage went viral the following morning, those present at the meal were shocked and confronted the accused about it, court heard. “All reached the same conclusion that he had filmed it,” said the witness. Later, the accused allegedly admitted his mistake in a group chat among friends, but shrugged it off saying: “Feliċ will have his two days of fame"". During the sexual episode, the bar owner had ordered the couple to stop, telling them to “go outside or go to the bathroom”.  But when his orders were ignored multiple times, he closed the entrance to the club and went back to his cooking.  Questioned about the couple at the centre of attention, the witness said “Feliċ did what he did freely. No one forced him"". Moreover, he seemed to be aware that he was being filmed because “he began to pose and wave, conscious of the filming”.  “What about the woman,” asked the prosecutor. “She too,” came the reply.  Cross-examined by defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, the witness confirmed that he too was holding his mobile phone at the time of the incident.  He was scrolling casually because, after a while, he lost interest in what was going on around him. “Were you on a video call?” pressed on Azzopardi.  “Yes, because someone called me and I answered. He [the caller] asked: ‘what’s all that noise?’ And I hung up.”  The case, presided over by Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia, continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Kurt Farrugia are prosecuting.

Woman spared 15-month jail term over wrong bail book location,Matthew Xuereb,"A woman has been spared 15 months in jail and indefinite detention over a separate case after a court found that the bail book she was convicted of failing to sign was at a different police station than the one mentioned in the charge sheet. Charlene Gatt, 37 from St Paul’s Bay, was convicted of having failed to sign the bail book as part of her bail conditions over a case in which she stood charged with allegedly hitting her female neighbour with a meat mallet. The court heard how she suddenly stopped signing the bail book between October 2021 and February 2022 when she was finally rearrested and charged with breach of bail. She was jailed for nine months and a six-month suspended sentence was brought into effect. The court had also ordered her detention until her case is decided as well as the revocation of a €5,000 bail bond. But presiding over her appeal, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera noted that the first court could have never found her guilty of failing to sign the bail book at the Żebbuġ police station because the bail decree presented in court by the prosecution stated that the bail book was at the police station in Paola. On the basis of this alone, the court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against Gatt. Moreover, the court observed that from testimonies of experts who knew Gatt, including a family doctor who had known her for at least 15 years, the woman had problems that would be better addressed outside jail. She was a single mother who was battling a drug addiction, among other problems. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera said that Gatt would be better off outside jail, where she can be followed closely by a probation officer and other experts who can help her get her life back on the right track. She therefore cleared her of the charges and overturned the effective jail term imposed by the first court. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Another three men charged over Ħamrun brawl,Edwina Brincat,"Three men, who allegedly triggered a massive brawl in Ħamrun earlier this week, were remanded in custody upon arraignment on Friday afternoon.  Ibrahim Flej, 33, Ismael Rajih, 32 and Kacem Al Flieg, 23, all sharing the same Qormi address, were escorted to court after being tracked down over their alleged involvement in the “big commotion” that broke out at around 1 pm on Tuesday.  Two Syrian brothers, Saoud and Naief Mahmoud, were arraigned on Thursday and were also denied bail.  Today, the court heard how last Tuesday, officers at the Ħamrun police station heard a lot of shouting outside.  They went out to check and saw many people rushing in one direction.  Heading in that direction, a short distance away from the station, the policemen came across a “large scale commotion,” with people locked in a scuffle.  Four men were arrested and escorted to the police station for questioning.  Two of them were subsequently released.  The other two, who bore visible signs of injury, were taken to the polyclinic, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa.  Footage from the scene of the brawl led to the identification of three other suspects, namely the trio arraigned on Friday.  They had arrived in Ħamrun in a van which they parked some way off from the site where the incident took place.  They stepped out of the vehicle and lingered nearby, apparently waiting. Then suddenly, all three dashed in the direction of the area where the fight broke out.  That footage did not capture the fight but at one point, Ibrahim returned to the van, drew out a piece of wood and headed back in the direction of the fight scene. That wooden object was the same one police seized when they stepped in to break up the fight, the prosecutor said.  The suspected trio were arrested and interrogated. On Friday they pleaded not guilty to slightly injuring Saoud, inciting a gathering of ten or more persons, actively participating in that crowd, speaking foul or indecent language in public and wilful breach of public peace.  The defence requested bail, arguing that these were summary charges carrying a punishment which did not exceed two years imprisonment.  The accused had untainted criminal records, a fixed address and jobs. Moreover, there was no risk of tampering with evidence since the alleged victims were currently in jail, under preventive custody, argued lawyer Frank Anthony Tabone.  The prosecution objected since the alleged victims and other eyewitnesses were still to testify.  Saoud was initially reluctant to tell police that he had suffered the blows.  The brawl appeared to have stemmed from some unresolved issue regarding payments related to work that the parties had undertaken.  Saoud did not even want to go to the polyclinic at first, but later explained that he had received the first blow on the head from Ibrahim. Parte civile lawyer Matthew Xuereb pointed out that there were civilian witnesses, including a veteran lawyer and Saoud’s partner, who were still to testify.  His clients had been charged when they were the victims, said the lawyer.  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Gatt, turned down the request for bail given the nature of the charges and the fact that civilians were still to testify.

'It's already committed': PA sanctions illegal St Julian's seaside ticket booth,Matthew Xuereb,"The Planning Authority has sanctioned an illegal concrete structure along the St Julian’s promenade because it reasoned there are already other commitments in the area. In just a couple of minutes, the commission’s three members ignored objections to the proposal to sanction the illegally built room for an ATM machine and an adjacent ticket booth. The structure is over three times the size of what should have been the maximum allowable size in the area.  The 12-square-metre structure had been built on the strength of a development notification order but the permit was revoked following an investigation by the commissioner for environment and planning within the office of the ombudsman who recommended its revocation. At first, the PA ignored his recommendations forcing him to send the report to parliament for action, which was eventually taken. The original permit was filed by Neptunes Waterpolo Club president Matthew Bonello who proposed the construction of the structure overlooking the Neptunes pitch in Ċensu Tabone Street. In his report, the ombudsman noted that such a structure is regulated by subsidiary legislation covering DNOs, which states that structures such as post boxes, ATMs, vending machines and telephone booths cannot have an area larger than one square metre. He said the structure approved by the PA was three times the permissible size. The planning ombudsman investigated the structure upon receipt of a complaint from a resident who argued that the structure was built through a development notification order (DNO) when it should have gone through the normal permit process. The ombudsman concluded the PA had committed errors in its endorsement of the DNO and had “irregularly approved it”. While the investigation was underway, work on the structure continued at a fast pace and was completed and is already being used as a tourist ticketing booth. Bonello applied to sanction the building, which the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage objected to, given the structure’s impact on views of numerous scheduled properties across Balluta Bay. Several residents also objected to the sanctioning, describing the structure as an “eyesore” and that it blocks the promenade. However, the case officer concluded that the developed room could be considered favourably because of the “limited scale of the proposal and the surrounding commitments”. He also recommended the imposition of a fine of €1,277. The commission endorsed this conclusion, with chairperson Stephania Baldacchino and members Mireille Fsadni and Lorinda Vella all saying they had nothing to add to the case officer’s report. Reacting to the decision, the former mayor of St Julian’s, now Nationalist MP Albert Buttigieg, denounced the “construct first, sanction later mentality” which was “giving cowboys a field day”. He expressed concern that this was going to be used as a precedent for other applications along the promenade. Criticising the case officer who justified the application because the area was committed, Buttigieg said this did not hold water. “Using the same logic, then we can swear because many do or evade tax because a great number do. With this decision, the PA continues to lose credibility. It is high time to suggest that the committee members be held responsible,” he said.

PN claims TM employees were asked to lie under oath,Times of Malta,"The PN claimed on Friday it has proof that Transport Malta employees were asked to lie under oath about meddling in contraventions.  The party said in a statement that these TM officials were asked to 'take care of' fines. This is yet another scandal involving a unit of Transport Malta which was responsible for the purchasing of five rigid hull inflatable boats which became unusable after a short time. Last year a National Audit Office review flagged a series of failures in the procurement of the boats for €721,000. Among other problems, the audit found that a single person was responsible for the entirety of the project, resulting in “insufficient oversight”, and that there was no evidence of any market research being carried out when calculating the project’s cost. Independent checks on the boats revealed that all five had “several defects of major significance”. As of June 2023, none of the boats were deemed to be fully compliant, with only three of them considered to be “fit for the intended use” and currently in use, according to the NAO review. Back then, the PN had claimed TM spent €1.2 million on repairing the boats, but the vessels still could not be used. When the NAO's findings were published, the PN called for action, insisting that someone had to be held accountable. On Friday, the Opposition said no details have yet emerged from the internal investigation it had requested. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Maltese man to be extradited to US as prime suspect in FBI malware investigation,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 1.35pm A Maltese man will be extradited to the US as part of an FBI investigation into the sale of illegal malware on the dark web. Daniel Joe Meli, 27, from Żabbar was also allegedly involved in mentoring services on a hacking forum, according to police. The malware is known as RAT - or remote access trojan - and is used by criminals to gain access to and control computers and servers. Several US victims have fallen prey to RAT, with no reported victims in Malta so far, the police added. A search and arrest warrant for Meli, a check-in agent, was issued by a magistrate on Tuesday. On Facebook, he says he works for Aviaserve and previously worked at Air Malta.  The investigations in Malta were led by the Cybercrime Unit following a request for assistance by the US authorities, which believe that the prime suspect in the sale of malware is Maltese. According to investigations by the local police, Meli was working with other people who were not Maltese and did not live here. He was arrested at his place of work in Gudja on February 7. Several items linked to the investigation were confiscated from places owned by the suspect. He was escorted to court, where Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday kicked off the extradition procedure. Meli consented to the extradition and is being kept at the Corradino Correctional Facility in the meantime. His lawyer, Joe Giglio, invoked the rule of speciality, meaning that he was to be extradited to answer only for the charges indicated in the relative documentation.  A Nigerian accomplice was arrested in Nigeria, while investigations led by Europol are ongoing in Austria, Canada, Croatia, Finland, The Netherlands, Romania, Germany and Nigeria. Inspectors Dr Mario Cuschieri and Robinson Mifsud prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Final property deeds remain constant in January, promises of sale up 26%",Times of Malta,"The number of final deeds of sale recorded last month is similar to the contracts signed in January of last year, however, the number of promises of sale increased by 26% over one year. According to national data released on Friday, the number of final deeds of sale relating to residential property last month amounted to 1,112 - a 0.1 per cent decrease over those registered in January 2023. The value of these deeds totalled €295.8 million, representing a decrease of 2.8 per cent when compared to the corresponding value recorded in January 2023. The highest numbers of deeds were recorded in the Northern Harbour District while the lowest in the Western District. During the month under review, the number of properties transacted in the final deeds of sale was equivalent to 1,196. Apartments (435) and garages (238) accounted for the largest shares, at 36.4 per cent and 19.9 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, 1,157 promise of sale agreements relating to residential property were registered last month - equivalent to an increase of 25.8 per cent over the same period in 2023. Individual potential buyers (households) accounted for 1,051 (or 90.8 per cent) of these agreements, while the rest mainly involved companies. Again, the largest number of promise of sale agreements related to residential properties were registered in the Northern Harbour District, while the lowest figures of promise of sale agreements were noted in the Western District.

"Strong winds, showers expected, but carnival organisers not too worried",Daniel Ellul,"Rain and strong winds are forecast to lash Malta from this weekend but carnival organisers are optimistic it will not disrupt Valletta's five-day festivities. The Meteorological Office is predicting strong winds to start on Saturday, with thundery showers on Sunday and isolated showers until Tuesday. But Valletta Carnival's artistic director, Jason Busuttil, is not too worried.  ""A few trickles of rain are normal in February, and the floats can handle that. We are not expecting a storm, so everything should be okay,"" he said. Preparations have continued as usual, and some floats have already been wheeled to Valletta in preparation for the first day of carnival, he said.  Because of the strong winds, the floats will not be parked at the Floriana Granaries as usual but will be kept at a different location when not in use, Busuttil said.  ""We are discussing where to store them this morning,"" he said on Friday. In a statement on Friday, Malta Public Transport said it would be temporarily relocating two of its bays so that carnival floats can shelter in St James' ditch, which is well protected from the wind.  Terminus Zones B and C will be relocated to St Publius Street and Sarria Street, on opposite sides of the Granaries, in Floriana.  The changes will impact routes to Ċirkewwa, Buġibba, Naxxar, San Ġwann and B’kara from Bay B and those to Rabat, Dingli, Mtarfa, Attard, Qormi, Mrieħel, Żebbuġ, Siġġiewi in Bay C.  Routes that depart and alight from Bay A, namely toward Mater Dei, St Julian’s, Sliema and the south will not be impacted.   In 2019, a severe storm damaged several carnival floats sheltered in two huge temporary tents in Marsa.  Busuttil said several floats this year are based on real-life people instead of fictional characters ""One float is about X-Factor, for example,"" he added.  A record number of companies will also be participating in competitive dance shows this year, he said.  The Valletta festivities are the country's main carnival events.  They will kick off on Friday evening, with King Carnival leading a parade down Republic Street in Valletta to St George's Square at 6pm.  The competitive dance shows will continue with an afternoon programme on Saturday starting at 4pm and a morning programme on Sunday starting at 10am.  Another parade will take to the streets of Valletta on Monday morning lasting through the evening and culminating in a grand finale on Tuesday along St Anne's Street in Floriana.

Women are making inroads in Malta's transport sector,James Cummings,"Malta had the EU's highest share of female transport workers in 2022, according to a recent Eurostat report. Women made up almost 28% of the country’s transport sector, the Key Figures on European Transport 2023 Edition said. The lowest share was recorded in Romania, where it was just over 10%. The European average, meanwhile, stood at around 17%. Malta’s results reflect a significant improvement since 2016 when it ranked ninth and with a share below the EU average. That year, Cyprus had the biggest share of female workers, but by six years later it had fallen to 16th place with a below-average share. Young people were also well represented in Malta, with the country having the third highest share of those aged 15 to 29 working in the sector, just behind Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which placed first and second respectively. Malta also reported the highest share of 15- to 49-year-olds working in transport, leaving it with the smallest proportion of workers aged 50 to 64 across the bloc in 2022. By contrast, more than half of transport sector workers in Estonia were aged 50 or above, with the country also having one of the lowest shares of the youngest workers aged 15 to 29. Perhaps unsurprisingly, due to government subsidies on fuel, Malta registered the lowest increase in transport costs in 2022 when prices rose by just over 5%. Meanwhile, fuels and lubricants were both unaffected by inflation that year, registering a zero increase in price. “Every EU member state recorded a rise in consumer prices for transport in 2022, ranging from 5.2% in Malta to more than 20% in Luxembourg and the Baltic member states,” the report said. “The relatively small increase in Malta reflected its stability in prices for transport fuels and lubricants (which are regulated) compared with increases elsewhere in the EU, which ranged from 13.3% in Hungary to 41.8% in Austria.” This trend continued throughout last year, with transport costs in Malta rising even less than the year before at an inflation rate of less than 2%, according to Eurostat data. However, despite the country seeing no increase in the price of fuel last and lubricants last year, it did not see a reduction in prices either, unlike most others in the EU. Lithuania saw the biggest fall in prices in 2023, when it recorded a reduction of over 12%, while only France and Iceland witnessed fuel price increases, albeit only slightly. Malta currently enjoys the lowest price at the pump for unleaded petrol, according to the most up-to-date European Commission weekly oil bulletin which regularly compares fuel prices across the bloc. Despite Malta’s reliance on cheap fuel, electric cars also saw healthy growth proportionally in 2022, with the country one of only seven where more than 15% of newly registered cars were electric. That year, more than one-sixth of all new cars registered in Malta was electric, with 990 cars using the technology out of the around 6,500 total. In March last year, then Parliamentary Secretary for EU Funds Chris Bonett said 2022 had seen more than 1,300 applications for grants to help pay for electric vehicles.

"Remarks by Robert Abela are an incitement to violence, PN says",Times of Malta,"The Nationalist Party has accused the prime minister of 'lying to incite violence' after remarks he made outside the law courts on Thursday. Abela made his comments after a sitting in the case instituted by the PN demanding that the government recover €400 million given to Vitals/Steward in the hospitals deal.   Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti abstained from continuing to hear the case last month after his partner - lawyer Yanika Bugeja - was appointed to act as curator representing Steward Assets Management Malta on the deed of rescission of ground rent on the lands concerning the public hospitals.  Mr Justice Toni Abela took over on Thursday after both the PN and the government's side said they had no objection to him. In his remarks Abela criticised the PN for instituting the case, arguing that it hindered international arbitration currently under way.  He also blamed the PN for the recusal of Mr Justice Grixti, claiming that the PN had 'put a pistol to his head'. The PN said this was a false claim, coming from a prime minister who over the past few weeks had repeatedly criticised the courts. The prime minister's choice of words, the party said, was aimed at inciting violent retaliation against the Opposition leader Bernard Grech, shadow minister Adrian Delia and anyone forming part of the PN. ""Robert Abela's words are unacceptable in a democratic society and show up Abela as an immature, dangerous and undemocratic politician,"" the PN said. It said it was holding Abela personally responsible for whatever damages may be suffered.   The party also expressed confidence n all the judges and magistrates.

Disability card to be accepted across all EU countries     ,Times of Malta,"Agreement has been reached within the EU's institutions for the disability card to be accepted across all EU countries.  The measure aims to make life easier for 87 million people with disabilities and their families, commission Vice President Vera Jourova said. The Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, who headed talks within the European Commission, and MEP David Casa, who was the  EPP’s negotiator, both welcomed the agreement.    Current systems relying on national identification cards in EU member states are not always recognised when users go to other EU countries, hindering their free movement in the bloc, the European Commission explained. That means that people with disabilities are sometimes prevented from priority access, reduced tariffs, reserved parking and special assistance. The European Disability Card aims to remedy that, though the commission noted that it would not be valid for access to national welfare systems for people with disabilities. ""We have taken a significant step towards ensuring the free movement and equal treatment of persons with disabilities across all Member States,"" Dalli said.    ""No matter where in the EU one may be, the European Disability Card will ensure that whether a cardholder is in their country or any of the other EU countries,  they will be entitled to the same special conditions and preferential treatment in accessing services, activities and facilities. As a participant country of the pilot project, Malta gained early insight and experiences with the concept of the Disability Card, which will facilitate smoother transitions towards the card's broader implementation under the new directive. ” The new measure is expected to come into force in the coming months following publication in the EU's Journal.

Man injured in suspected pit bull attack in Siġġiewi,Jessica Arena,"Police are searching for the owner of two large dogs, believed to be pit bulls, after a man was attacked while out walking his dog in Siġġiewi. Joe Azzopardi was taking his King Charles spaniel for a walk along Triq Mons Mikiel Azzopardi, the Siġġiewi bypass when they were attacked by two unleashed dogs, according to his wife, Claudia. Publishing pictures of the two dogs on Facebook, Azzopardi said the animals had lunged at her husband, who had to be helped by bystanders to restrain them.  “They pushed him to the ground and tried to kill our small dog,” Azzopardi said. “I would like everybody to be aware that these dogs are allowed to roam without a leash in this area.”    A police spokesperson confirmed the attack and said it happened shortly after 8am on Thursday.  An investigation is ongoing and police are looking for the owner of the two dogs.  Azzopardi was slightly injured and his dog received veterinary care, a police spokesperson said.  In a 2021 report, Animal Welfare Commissioner Alison Bezzina recommended that the breeding and importation of pit bulls and bully breeds be “strictly controlled if not temporarily stopped”.  This should be enforced, she said, until breeders can be properly assessed and licensed and “the country is in a better position to cater for such breeds”.   RELATED STORIES  Last year Noah’s Ark Pet Sanctuary, the last remaining charity that agreed to rehome the breed, announced that it had to stop accepting pit bulls due to the increasing number of the dogs being abandoned.  The sanctuary said that these dogs were harder to rehome while also needing to be walked and housed separately from other dogs.  Bezzina has also previously warned that should the stress and lack of resources for animal shelters continue, Malta is heading towards introducing kill shelters.  In 2020 breeder Andre Galea’s pit bulls attacked and killed his 95-year-old aunt Inez. In a separate incident last year, Galea himself was mauled by his dogs in his Msida home, with footage showing him taking refuge on top of a car out on the street to evade them.

Driver seriously injured in crash after avoiding metal that fell off truck,Times of Malta,"Updated Friday 8am A driver was seriously injured when his SUV crashed into a barrier on Ħal Far Road, Gudja, after he tried to avoid loose metal which fell from a truck in front of him. The white Kia Sportage ended up perched on the crash barrier, with debris scattered all over the road, forcing its closure for all traffic. The accident happened on Thursday at about 4pm.  The SUV's driver, aged 35, was trapped in the wreckage and needed to be helped out by rescuers from the Civil Protection Department. Sources said the accident was caused when rods fell off a truck in front of the SUV, forcing the driver to suddenly swerve. The Iveco Trakker was being driven by a 34-year-old from Birżebbuġa. Transport Malta urged motorists in the area to seek alternative routes.  Police investigations and a magisterial inquiry are ongoing.

Award to recognise outstanding women in every locality,Times of Malta,"The mayors of all towns and villages in Malta and Gozo are being invited to nominate women of outstanding service from their localities for a Women's Award which will be announced on March 8, International Women's Day. The award was announced on Thursday by Lydia Abela, the prime minister's wife, who said women of any age and from any strata of society may be nominated, on the basis of their contribution to society which would have yielded positive change in people's lives.   Dr Abela met the mayors at Villa Francia, Lija, where she explained that the award's purpose is to recognise the contribution of outstanding women in society.   The award will also give increased local importance to Women's Day, which should not only celebrate achievements but also serve as a day of reflection on what else was needed for women, she said.   Abela said that sharing the success stories of the nominated women would promote the role of women in society.    The award is being supported by the Parliamentary Secretariat for Local Government and the Secretariat for Equality.

"January was warmer, saw less than half the usual rainfall - Met Office",Times of Malta,"January produced 42.1mm less rain than the climatic norm and was brighter than usual, the Meteorological Office at Malta Airport said on Thursday. In a statement, the Met Office said that only 37.3mm of precipitation was measured, with thunderstorms on only two days and only one occurrence of precipitation with hail. January was also 1.2°C warmer than the norm, registering an average temperature of 14.1°C. January 18 had a glimpse of summer, with the highest temperature soaring to 24.5°C. But the highest January temperature ever recorded by the Meteorological Office remained that of 25.8°C, in 2021. January 23 was the coldest day of last month at 6.7°C, though it was well above the record 1.4°C in 1981. Last month was also brighter than usual, exceeding the climatic norm by 11.5 hours to register 181 hours of sunshine. Despite the fact that the average January day saw 5.8 hours of sunshine, less than one hour of sunshine was recorded (0.9) on January 11, the month’s gloomiest day. At 9.0 knots, the average wind strength was in line with the monthly norm of 8.9 knots. The sixth and seventh days of January were the windiest, as gusts reaching 47 knots were measured across both days, the Met Office said. The Met Office said fine and relatively warm weather is expected to usher in Carnival on Friday. But the weather is expected to become unstable and blustery in the following days, with thundery showers forecast for Sunday. The wind is expected to increase between Friday and Saturday and remain rather strong to strong, varying between Force 5 and 6, for the remaining days.

Bus users up by a third after bus service becomes free,Neville Borg,"Public transport users increased by more than a third after the bus service was made free in late 2022, according to Transport Malta figures, but authorities still face an uphill struggle in convincing commuters to ditch their cars. Data provided by Transport Malta shows that there were 265,378 public transport users in the 12 months after October 2022, when the service became free for all users with a personalised Tallinja card. This was some 35% higher than during the previous 12 months, when bus usage had started to climb back up after numbers dwindled during the pandemic. This was also higher than any point during the previous five years, when traffic peaked at a little over 229,000 users between October 2018 and September 2019.  These figures don’t include tourists, who typically travel using different types of travel cards. The government has spent some €32m, roughly €2m each month, to subsidise the bus service ever since it became free. This has raised questions over whether this investment was justified, with Malta’s traffic woes showing little signs of easing. The number of passengers who use the bus frequently also appears to be inching upwards. While in previous years roughly half of all passengers only used the service sporadically, fewer than 50 times in an entire year, this has now dipped slightly to 44% of users. On the other hand, almost a third of all bus users (31%) use the service regularly, making over 200 trips in a year, and 44% of all users made at least 100 trips. In previous years, this figure usually stood at under 40%.  In total, almost 82,000 bus users used the bus over 200 times in the 12 months after the service became free in October 2022. This was almost 30,000 more than the previous 12 months and 20,000 more than the previous five-year high in 2018-19. However, the number of occasional users – those who made fewer than 50 trips all year – also shot up from a little under 108,000 in 2018-19, to almost 116,500 last year. The increase in bus users can be partly seen as a reflection of Malta’s growing population, with some 50,000 more people living in the country today than there were at the end of 2018. Meanwhile, transport authorities have been trying to encourage more people to sign up for a Tallinja card, with a recent drive adding 10,000 new registrations this year. Working-age people between the ages of 19 and 65 now make up a 71% share of all registered public transport users. This figure has grown year-on-year since 2018, suggesting that there is a gradual increase in the share of people using the bus for their commute. Again, this needs to be understood within the context of Malta’s broader demographic change. Malta’s most recent census, carried out in 2021, found that the number of working-age people across the island has increased over the past decade, mostly thanks to the arrival of foreign nationals who were predominantly of working age. Meanwhile, the share of older adults, over the age of 65, who use public transport has dipped under 20% for the first time in the past five years, now standing at 19%. Meanwhile, a further one in ten registered bus users is under the age of 18, a similar figure to most previous years.  However, free use of buses had already been a reality for some of these users. Free bus travel for people between the ages of 14 and 20, as well as students over the age of 21 came into effect in 2019. These figures, while encouraging, have done little to stem the flow of new cars on the road. Official data published late last year found that there are a total of 436,000 cars on Malta’s roads, with a net average increase of 43 new cars on the road each day. Transport authorities have been reluctant to penalise car use, with then-Transport Minister Aaron Farrugia last year arguing that penalties would impose an excessive financial burden on people. Experts however argue that measures disincentivising personal car use must go hand in hand with investment in public transport to encourage a modal shift towards alternative modes of transport.

"KM Malta serves the elite, Ryanair serves the people, says low-cost airline boss",Daniel Ellul,"Malta’s national airline is for the “elite” while Ryanair serves the people and the tourism industry, the low-cost airline’s top brass said yesterday.   “[The national airline] serves the political elite and the business elite but, in terms of delivering for the Maltese people and delivering for tourism, it really doesn’t have a role there,” Malta Air CEO David O’Brien said. O’Brien was speaking beside Michael O’Leary, who is CEO of Ryanair, Malta Air’s parent company. The two were in Malta to launch Ryanair’s Malta summer schedule, which sees three new routes introduced: Belfast, Norwich and Rome Fiumicino. O’Leary said Maltese tourism would not be growing as quickly if not for Ryanair.   “Air Malta is a proud airline with a distinguished history but it’s fundamentally a very small and very high-fare airline. It does connect Malta to the main cities around Europe but it’s not delivering any growth, whereas Ryanair is delivering enormous growth,” the Ryanair CEO said.   Air Malta is set to fly for the last time on March 30. After that, a new airline, KM Malta, will take over as Malta’s national carrier.   “It’s pretty clear it’s the same airline; there is not even a fig leaf to suggest there’s anything different; we’re not going to complain about that particularly,” O’Brien said.   One reason the national carrier cannot do much for tourism growth is that it has few aircraft, so there is only so much they can do.    “When you’ve got eight aircraft, it’s very hard to achieve the critical mass that you can with 570 (planes),” he said.    “That’s not to mock them; they have a niche and they should deliver on that,” O’Brien said.   O’Leary said that Malta used to see most of its holidaymakers in the summer and that has now changed because of Ryanair.  “Malta has always been a tourism destination but it has always seen lots of charter flights on Saturdays during the summer and then nobody in the winter. Malta needs more than that”, the Ryanair CEO said.    “Ryanair delivers growth and year-round connectivity and that’s the difference we make here on the island,” he said.  Malta is now connected to more destinations than ever before, meaning people from all over are visiting the country, O’Leary said.   He said that other low-cost airlines, like Wizz Air and Easy Jet, have only a few routes and focus on the summer season.

"Russian hackers claim Times of Malta website attack, threaten others",Giulia Magri,"A group of Russia-linked cybercriminals claims it was behind a major attack on the Times of Malta website, purportedly to fight ""those who support sanctions against Russia"". The hackers have also threatened to go after other Maltese sites. The so-called People’s Cyber Army of Russia called on its followers to target Times of Malta in a message posted to a Telegram group named ‘People’s CyberArmy’ on Tuesday at 7.57am. ""We continue our modest work against Malta,"" a message to the group's 31,600 subscribers read.  “Next up the oldest daily newspaper in Malta is the Times of Malta... We are not against the country itself and its inhabitants, we are against those who support sanctions against Russia. Let's attack."" A short time later, Times of Malta's website was overwhelmed by connection requests, forcing it offline.  The attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, overloaded Times of Malta servers and breached existing protections in place, causing the website to go offline for most readers for around 45 minutes at its peak, after the Telegram group was instructed to ""attack"". It continued until 10am on Tuesday.  The attack was purely external and no data breach is suspected. Times of Malta has reported the cyberattack to the police, who are investigating and are constantly being updated.  Although Malta's largest website has been targeted in the past, the scale of Tuesday's attack was unprecedented locally.   Editor-in-chief Herman Grech and online editor Bertrand Borg said: ""So far, it appears that this malicious attack on our website was perpetrated by Russian hackers or people supporting an illegal and brutal war condemned by the civilised world. ""This concerted effort appears to be an assault on the principles of free press and free speech, ideals sorely absent in Putin’s Russia. We will continue cooperating with the police and our international media partners to try to reduce these cowardly tactics.""   The People’s Cyber Army of Russia is a prominent group in the world of cybercrime, and has been implicated in several major cyberattacks.  According to Radware, a cybersecurity provider, the group has been around for years, often targeting Ukrainian targets.  The group is believed to have targeted Ukrainian power companies in 2015 and 2016, causing power outages across parts of the country, and also claimed responsibility for a massive DDoS attack on Ukraine's nuclear agency.  In February 2023, it attacked a Ukrainian satellite provider, as it sought to disrupt the country's communications capabilities.  The group believes that Ukraine is under the “leadership of the United States” and is fighting an information war against Russian citizens. “We created this movement to jointly respond to any actions directed against our compatriots. All our operations are aimed at conveying a simple message- we do not accept a security threat to our country.” The Maltese government and Times of Malta have been vocal in their criticism of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, which has sparked a devastating war.  The Telegram post urging cybercriminals to attack Times of Malta was flagged to Times of Malta on Wednesday by cyber security researcher and threat intelligence analyst Ziyahan Albeniz. On the same day, the Telegram chat included messages threatening to attack the University of Malta and Malta Customs websites. Times of Malta informed the police about those threats.  When contacted, a University of Malta spokesperson said there were no issues with their website over the past days.

Identità investigates 197 reports of exploitation of third-country nationals,Times of Malta,"Identità, the former Identity Malta agency, investigated 197 reports of exploitation of third-country nationals last year, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told parliament on Wednesday. In reply to a question by PN MP Graziella Attard Previ, Camilleri said that 122 of these investigations had been concluded while the rest are still pending. He did not give any details on the conclusions of the investigations. Attard Previ asked the minister how many reports of exploitation of third-country nationals were received by Identità since 2013. Camilleri replied that the agency investigated all reports it received. To this end, a Compliance Unit was established recently within the agency. He said that in 2023, 197 investigations were opened, 122 of which have since been concluded. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Ministries should have climate change officials - Opposition,Matthew Xuereb,"Ministries should have a designated representative focusing solely on climate change, evaluating compliance with international obligations, Opposition spokesperson for climate change Eve Borg Bonello said on Wednesday. She said these people should not only be answerable to the minister but also to the Climate Action Authority, whose setting up is currently being discussed by parliament.   Borg Bonello explained that officials focused on climate change should evaluate compliance with international obligations linked to climate change and provide advice.  All this was crucial for the strategies for climate change in Malta to be holistic. Borg Bonello said the Nationalist Party had always been a pioneer in climate change issues. It was the Nationalist Opposition that in 2019 submitted to the Maltese Parliament the request for a declaration of a climate change emergency. The setting up of the Climate Change Authority was a step in the right direction, she said, but much more needed to be done. ""I cannot understand why we had to wait five years before taking action,” she said.    During these last months, even in its parliamentary work, the Nationalist Party put forward ideas and proposals for the same authority, which the government had ignored. The Nationalist Party extended the hand of collaboration several times but the government decided to do it alone, without any form of consultation, not even with experts in the field. The authority, she said, was essential to move forward and take urgent action to limit emissions, improve air quality and mitigate the effects of climate change in the country, especially since Malta fell six places in the Climate Change Performance Index last year. Only last week, Malta was found to have the highest dependence on polluting energy sources in the European Union. Unfortunately, however, the bill for the setting up of the authority was drafted in haste “to save face”. The Nationalist MP said the government and opposition should work together  because this generation and those of the future would look back and say that action was not taken when it was needed most. “If we do not act now, we will be condemning future generations to hell on earth,” she warned.

Prime minister tours delayed Msida school project,Times of Malta,"Construction of the new government primary school in Msida has been completed and the finishing works have started, the Ministry of Education said on Wednesday after a visit by the prime minister. It said the school, a €24m project, will feature 26 classrooms and other classrooms for specific subjects such as social and personal development,  science, arts, music and ethics. It will also include a library, a hall for 300, a childcare centre, and a two-level carpark for 180 cars. Education Minister Clifton Grima, who accompanied the prime minister, was quoted as saying in the government statement that the project underlined the priority that the Labour government gave to education. This, he said, was an investment in school children and educators.  The media was not invited for the event, and no mention was made in the statement about the current industrial dispute between the government and the teachers' union.  In 2017 the Education Ministry promised that the new primary school would be delivered in two years, but the project was beset by problems.  In 2022, part of the newly-built building had to be demolished after the government entity in charge of school maintenance found that the quality of the new building was not up to standard.  In December 2022 Grima had said the primary school would welcome students in September 2023. In a reaction to the prime minister's visit, the shadow minister for education, Justin Schembri, said the Msida school, which was meant to be completed last year was still in shell form and it had run over budget by €14 million.  This project's delays had cost the country millions which could have been used on other schools as well. He said the PN looked forward to the opening of this school as soon as possible.

"1,553 on social housing waiting list",Times of Malta,"There are 1,553 people on the Housing Authority waiting list for social accommodation. Replying to a parliamentary question by PN MP Graziella Attard Previ, Housing Minister Roderick Galdes said this number, as at the end of last year, did not include those who were waiting to move into the property allocated to them. Replying to another question by the same MP, Galdes said there were 1,026 families on the waiting list for social accommodation while the waiting list of applications filed by adults involved 1,206 children. Asked about the social housing projects in Msida and Siġġiewi, Galdes said the government was making the largest investment in social housing buildings that the country had ever seen. An investment of more than €130 million would result in approximately 1,700 apartments in 13 localities. This meant 1,700 decent and dignified housing for families with social needs. Last year, four social housing projects were completed, providing housing for 70 families. Work continued this year with the opening of social housing blocks in Kirkop which is being followed by those of Siġġiewi and Msida. The latter will be the largest social housing building in the country, with 112 apartments with an investment of almost €10 million.

"Driver in crash that killed two men could not remember the accident, court told",Edwina Brincat,"A man accused of killing two motorcycle riders in a crash in Mosta last year was amnesiac to the accident but discharged himself from hospital against medical advice, a court heard on Wednesday. He however returned later that day complaining of chest pain and in a “very anxious” state. The details emerged when criminal proceedings resumed against Karl Vella Petroni, who is pleading not guilty to involuntary homicide. The accident took place in the early morning of May 6 last year when the Smart car which Petroni was driving, crashed head-on into a small motorcycle on Triq iz-Zejfa, Mosta. Two Pakistani men, Faizan Muhammed and Ali Abbas, who were riding that motorbike on their way to work, were killed. Vella Petroni later tested positive for alcohol, cannabis and cocaine. Two eyewitnesses, a jogger and a driver, later testified in court that Vella Petroni’s car was being driven at high speed on the wrong lane in the direction from Mġarr to Mosta, before crashing into the motorcycle. A police officer who was among the first persons to reach the accident site, recalled how he had smelt alcohol on Vella Petroni, who looked tired and had “black eyes.” When the case resumed on Wednesday, a doctor presented written records from the emergency department at Mater Dei Hospital, where Vella Petroni was admitted after the crash. A doctor who first examined him noted that he “did not recall events and was completely amnesiac to the accident.” He was described as a “smoker” with “occasional alcohol use.” “Nothing alarming” was noted upon medical examination, but further observation was recommended since the patient was suffering from memory loss. However, contrary to medical advice, Vella Petroni discharged himself, signing the relative form. Later that same day, he returned to the hospital complaining of chest pain and continued to do so even after being administered painkillers. In view of that condition and his “very anxious” state, the doctor who examined him that evening around 8pm recommended a psychiatric review and other medical care, including an ESG check at six-hourly intervals.   Asked by defence lawyer Charles Mercieca whether those recommendations were normal when a patient presented such symptoms, the doctor replied in the affirmative. Earlier during Wednesday’s sitting, digital forensic expert Keith Cutajar reported about the geolocation data extracted from the accused’s mobile phone. On the day of the accident, phone activity started at around 1:30 am and went on until 3am, indicating that the device was in the area of “Mellieha fields.” The last “ping” was recorded at 3.48am. Following that, there was no other activity until around 6am, which coincided with the time of the crash. A lot of activity was recorded at the time, particularly relating to the phone’s camera application, with data indicating that the device was used to take photos and videos. Asked why no activity was recorded between 3am and 6am, the expert said that there were various plausible reasons. That could be due to the fact that the phone’s battery was low, or because the device was stored in some space where its sensors were not exposed to light. Or perhaps, the device’s touchscreen was untouched. The expert believed that there was no interaction between the user and the device. Geolocation data was recorded when the device connected to satellite antennae. Since there was no intermittent data between 3am and 6am, he could not calculate the phone’s movement speed at the time of the incident, explained the expert. The case, presided over by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, continues. Inspector Godwin Scerri prosecuted. Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Gianluca Caruana Curran are defence counsel. Lawyer Matthew Xuereb is appearing parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"ALIVE Charity Foundation donates €120,000 for University cancer research",Times of Malta,"The ALIVE Charity Foundation has donated €120,000 to the Research, Innovation and Development Trust at the University of Malta. The money was raised during a fund-raising campaign last year and will be used for cancer research projects aimed at advancing understanding of cancer and improving treatment options. The donation coincided with World Cancer Day on February 4, the international day dedicated to raising awareness about cancer. ""We are proud to make this donation on World Cancer Day, a day that resonates deeply with our mission to combat this devastating disease. The funds will go towards supporting ground-breaking research projects at the University of Malta, contributing to advancements in cancer treatment and care,"" said Nicky Camilleri, chairperson of the ALIVE Charity Foundation. University Rector Prof Alfred Vella said the generous and regular donations by ALIVE Charity Foundation made it possible for the University of Malta to sustain a long term vision of cutting-edge cancer research. ""It is very encouraging for our researchers to know that they can count on NGOs, individuals and businesses within the community, I encourage others to follow the footsteps of the ALIVE Charity Foundation,” said Prof Vella said. Since its inception in 2013, the foundation has donated over €820,000 for various cancer research projects.

Maltese farmers welcome EU decision to scrap plans to halve pesticide use,Giulia Magri,"Farmers who took to the street in a mass protest last week have welcomed a decision by the European Commission to scrap plans to halve pesticide use across the EU. The move by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is an apparent concession to farmers who protested in many EU countries, including Malta. She told the European Parliament in Strasburg on Tuesday that the proposal had become a “symbol of polarisation”. Pesticide reduction was one of a long list of grievances that prompted Malta's farmers to protest for the first time in 40 years last Friday, driving their tractors from Ta' Qali to Floriana for the demonstration.  They argued that the rules intended to make farming more environmentally friendly were being introduced too quickly and without the necessary support to ensure farm production is not impacted.   Farming lobby group Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi who organised Friday's protest, said von der Leyen's decision was a ""positive development"".  Its spokesperson, Malcolm Borg, said the EU was learning a lesson ""the hard way"". ""To ask farmers to halve the use of products that are essential for them to produce a yield, and thus earn a living was insensitive and premature especially when considering that products competing with the produce of European farmers (coming from outside the EU) have no such restrictions,"" he said.  Borg explained that pesticides are essential to control pests and diseases, which can ruin a farmer's crop. ""Considering that farmers earn a living by selling produce and that they get a better price for better quality produce, halving pesticides would have meant lower quantities and qualities of crops,"" he said. ""Farmers are already struggling immensely to compete with imported produce coming from countries which can use a bigger toolkit than is allowed by the EU for European farmers, let alone if the toolkit of European farmers is further reduced. This would have had devastating impacts on farmers' livelihoods."" Borg said the way forward is to ensure that suitable alternatives are available before taking on measures that include halving pesticides.  ""Science and technology must fill the gap. Once they do, then we can continue discussing such targets, whilst ensuring that the farmers are on board."" The original proposal was put forward by the European Commission as part of the European Union’s Green Deal.  ""Our farmers deserve to be listened to,"" von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. ""Many of them feel pushed into a corner"". The EU had proposed to halve the use of chemicals by 2030 as part of its Green Deal, which is aimed at tackling climate change.

Labour MP cries foul over denied University promotion,Edwina Brincat,"Psychology academic and Labour MP Katya De Giovanni has filed a judicial protest calling on the University of Malta to reverse its decision to deny her promotion to associate professor. She described the decision as “arbitrary and unjust,” threatening further legal action against the University unless the decision, taken “illegally,”  was revoked and her promotion was granted with immediate effect. The protest followed a two-and a half year process which kicked off in March 2021 when DeGiovanni, a senior lecturer. applied for promotion to ‘associate professor.’ At the time she was chair of the Psychology Warranting Board and chairperson of the Social Care Standards Authority In October 2023, De Giovanni was informed that the Promotions Board had not recommended her promotion. Aggrieved by that decision which she deemed “arbitrary and unjust,” the academic requested the board to reconsider her application as she had a right to in terms of the collective agreement concerning academic staff at University. The board replied on January 26, telling her in a letter that: “Following a detailed analysis of your request and claims, the Promotions Board agreed that it could still not recommend to Council your promotion to Associate Professor as there were no grounds justifying a change from the original decision.”  In her judicial protest, De Giovanni questioned that “detailed analysis,” pointing out that no reasons were given for the refusal and this went against the administrative law principle regarding ‘the duty to give reasons.’ She had not even been summoned before the board and this also breached another sacrosanct principle, namely that of ‘audi alteram partem’ (hearing the other side). The two-and-a-half-year duration of her application process was also “unreasonable and unacceptable,” argued De Giovanni’s lawyer, Edward Zammit Lewis. It was pointed out that other candidates, including those whose qualifications and experience were inferior to De Giovanni’s, had been promoted and their application were processed far more speedily. The board did not mention six important publications by the applicant and her extensive curriculum vitae was not taken into consideration, the judicial protest says. De Giovanni is also a visiting professor at Padova University and a fellow at the British Psychology Society. De Giovanni said that unless the University revoked its decision, she would pursue further legal remedies including an action for judicial review as well as constitutional proceedings, if necessary. And if that were to happen, she would be constrained to mention names and produce concrete evidence to support such “damning discrimination” in her regard. The whole process was unreasonable and abusive, lacking due reasons, vitiated by procedural defects and ran counter to the doctrine of legitimate expectations, she insisted. Lawyer and Labour MP Edward Zammit Lewis signed the judicial protest. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Chamber of Architects launches probe into Gżira façade collapse,Matthew Xuereb,"The Chamber of Architects (KTP) has launched an investigation into Tuesday’s incident in Gżira when scaffolding and the façade of a construction site crashed onto Triq Belvedere, missing pedestrians by just metres. “As we always do in such cases, we immediately begin an investigation to establish the facts of the incident. Such an investigation helps establish whether there exists any prima facie evidence of professional negligence by any of the architects involved in such a project,” KTP president Andre Pizzuto told Times of Malta on Wednesday. He said the investigation, which began minutes after the incident was reported in the media, is seeking to establish the extent of the involvement of the architect who acquired the planning permission during the construction works, as well as the role of any other architects in the project. He stressed that the launching of an investigation did not imply any wrongdoing. Developer Kris Calleja and architect Colin Zammit applied to demolish various properties on Triq Belvedere to build a hotel, which will include a new façade identical to the existing one, in the interest of “maintaining the visual rhythm” of the streetscape. According to publicly available documents, the Building and Construction Authority issued a stop notice just after the collapse, ""except to render the site safe"". Pizzuto said the incident “is yet another demonstration of the inadequacy of the industry’s regulatory framework”. “While the authorities will undoubtedly claim they are fulfilling their obligations to the full extent of the law, such statements do not bring any reassurance.” Pizzuto said that since launching its vision for the industry in 2019, the BCA had “refused to engage in a meaningful strategic discussion on the priorities for the industry reform and how these fit in a wider framework.” Even previous ministers for the sector refused to engage with the Chamber on the reforms that were needed or to include it in their planning. “The picture that is emerging, particularly after the public inquiry (into Jean Paul Sofia’s death in 2022) is one where the BCA is at a complete loss as to where to start given the issue's complexity, and that the political leadership is weak and ineffective. This paralysis, coupled with the lack of industry knowledge, is resulting in this prolonged crisis. The draft regulations that are being sent to us are chaotic, disjointed and piecemeal,” Pizzuto said. “It is most unfortunate that while the BCA and its advisors attempt to grapple with the situation, public safety is put at risk. Meanwhile, the chamber's offers to provide consultancy to the government was, until the last cabinet reshuffle, summarily dismissed. It is unclear whether this reluctance to seek the assistance of the chamber is a result of political direction or personal egos. Either way, this situation is undermining the public interest,” he added. He said the chamber’s request for public funding to address deficiencies in the practice of the profession kept being rejected by the minister responsible for the sector despite approvals from the Finance Ministry. Pizzuto said he recently met Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, now responsible for the sector’s reform, “who seemed to be significantly more receptive to collaboration” together with other principal stakeholders such as the MDA.

"New Paceville junction to ease access to St Julian's, Swieqi",Matthew Xuereb,"Infrastructure Malta has announced plans for a new road junction in Paceville to facilitate access to St Julian's and Swieqi. CEO Ivan Falzon said on Wednesday that the agency is about to file a planning application for the project, which will eliminate the current traffic light junction. The project will cost between €40 to €50 million and take some two years to complete. Infrastructure Malta first announced that it was working on the project in August last year.    The new junction will also do away with the tunnel that links Swieqi to Paceville, replacing it with a hairpin loop, slipways and a roundabout that will connect the main road in all directions. Infrastructure Malta architect Robert Zerafa explained that the project aimed to improve traffic flow on Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli, a TEN-T route also known as the Regional Road, introduce a grade-separated junction to replace the existing traffic lights, as well as reorganise traffic lanes to improve vehicular accessibility to and from Swieqi and St Julian’s. The present main road will rise by 1.5 metres to allow for larger vehicles to use the underpass in and out of Swieqi and Paceville.   Zerafa, a senior manager at IM who heads the Design Unit, explained that a roundabout, a loop, and slipways will allow traffic to flow into St Julian’s and Swieqi.   Falzon said the detailed plans were drawn up in consultation with the respective local councils who, he said, had made suggestions that improved the overall design. Discussions with other stakeholders will continue even though the planning application for the project will be submitted in the coming days, he said. A traffic noise study, traffic modeling, geotechnical investigations, a survey of existing services utilities and other studies as may be required will be carried out as part of the planning process.   Falzon said IM is working with experts to split up the project into phases so that the busy road would not need to be closed completely because of the works. Asked about the St Andrew’s road project, Falzon said this was now complete and had re-opened to traffic in both directions on Saturday evening. Landscaping, signage and finishing touches will continue but the project has been completed from the traffic point of view. Work on the remaining part of the project – a hairpin at the entrance to Pembroke – is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the end of February.

"Tributes flow for Sammy Murgo, 'an icon of the Maltese jazz scene forever'",Fiona Galea Debono,"Just two weeks before legendary jazz musician Sammy Murgo died on Wednesday, he was shown a short film about himself. His eyes “sparkled with joy”, according to the documentary maker, and he expressed his eagerness to perform on the day of its release. That was not to be. But before leaving this world, Murgo, 87, got to see his place secured firmly in the history of jazz in Malta in the upcoming documentary film Strait Street to Abbey Road, and it had pleased him. The documentary filmmaker and percussionist Ġużè Camilleri, who has made it his mission to preserve and document the history of jazz in Malta, has joined a chorus of fellow musicians and the local arts scene to celebrate the humility and passion of the talented jazz pioneer and saxophonist of extraordinary talent, already described as a legend in his lifetime. According to Camilleri, the “humble musician with an unwavering passion for jazz”, did not like competition between musicians and kept himself away from it, preferring to focus solely on playing the best he could. When Camilleri visited him just two weeks ago to share the footage, little did he know that those would be their final words exchanged, he said in tribute to Murgo on the day his death was announced. “Even at the age of 87, his determination to play never wavered,” Camilleri recalled. Only last August, Murgo was performing with Carlo Muscat, another leading saxophone player, who said he was “inspired by the energy he was still able to inject into the music”. The Kyiv-based owner of the Storeroom music venue in Ta’ Xbiex, where the two last played together, said he considered himself “fortunate to have had the opportunity to perform with him on a couple of occasions”.  Muscat got to know Murgo in person later in his career, but he “instantly understood that he was the embodiment of musicianship: humble, dedicated, kind and relentless” – traits that have been echoed by others. Murgo understood the “value of creating connections and supporting other musicians to help cultivate a scene that could continue to flourish”, Muscat continued, adding “Sammy will remain an icon of the Maltese jazz scene forever”.  For well-known violinist and saxophonist George Curmi, known as ‘il-Puse’ after his saxophonist father, Murgo had been a fixture throughout his life.  ""Sammy was a part of my family for as long as I can remember; he took some saxophone lessons with my father and was actually godfather for one of my brothers,"" Curmi said.  He recalled he had shared his first TV appearance with the legendary saxophonist and later guested with his band in his first Malta Jazz Festival performance in 1991. ""He was a very good swing player and was mostly self-taught; he was a real jazz musician,"" said Curmi, adding that although Murgo had experimented with progressive jazz and the avant-garde, in his later years, he had returned to his roots. Born in Floriana, Murgo started studying the violin aged seven, under the tutelage of Agostino Camilleri, but at 13, he turned his attention to the saxophone thanks to the instruction of Mro Turu Pace.  His long career played out to see him collaborate with local and foreign musicians alike, including the US Navy’s Sixth Fleet band, dominating the entertainment scene in hotels and nightclubs. He remained an active part of Malta’s jazz scene and frequently performed live, including with American pianist Andy Jaffe at the Malta Jazz Festival. By the end, the low-profile master Maltese saxophonist had performed with at least three generations of artists. Mro Paul Abela is testimony to that. His memories of Murgo go back a long way. He had known him for 50 years and recalled how he used to play with his octogenarian drummer uncle at places like Premier, Brittania and Chalet back in the day. Murgo had embraced Abela on return from his studies in the US in the 1980s and, together with the father of Maltese jazz, Charles ‘is-City’ Gatt, and Charles Camilleri, they would experiment and perform. “Thank you for the music” Tributes played on for Murgo on the day of his death, with Teatrumalta saying his melodies “graced” their latest production, Gambori. “Thank you for the music, Sammy,” the national theatre company said, bidding farewell to one of the country's most eminent champions of jazz. For Kris Spiteri, pianist, musical director and composer, the island had lost “one of the finest Maltese musicians it had ever seen”. Over 20 years ago, he recalled, he had been asked to organise and play three duo concerts. He had never played with Murgo, but he was the first person who came to mind.  “I must admit I was a bit on edge at our first meeting. This guy was a legend, and it was somewhat intimidating to play with him…  “But to my surprise, he was so giving and so humble. He was not your ordinary player; he was a teacher, who explained all the intricacies of a wonderful period in jazz music,” Micallef said, highlighting his captivating sound and authentic phrasing.  “He knew the jazz language and he spoke it like a giant.” Social media was flooded with comments and condolences, and Culture Minister Owen Bonnici tuned in too, saying the leading exponent of the Maltese jazz scene would be “sorely missed by the many musicians who were inspired by his extraordinary talent”. Musician and songwriter Kevin Borg also honoured his amazing “friend, teacher and mentor” describing his former Saxophone teacher as a “role model” and sending his condolences to his wife and family, who “adored” him.

Half of 112 calls are a hoax but Minister says 'prank calls' are on the decline,Giulia Magri,"More than half of the calls to emergency hotline 112 last year were either invalid or hoaxes, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said.  The 112 line connects to all emergency services, including ambulance, police, civil protection, and armed forces. The line is available everywhere in the EU and the call is free of charge.  On Wednesday, Camilleri said the free emergency line received 360,941 calls last year, with 205,034 flagged as either “prank calls” or meant to be directed to another entity.  While the figure may seem alarmingly high, the minister said the number of invalid calls to the emergency hotline has decreased when compared to previous years.    In 2021, more than three in every four calls to the emergency line were invalid or hoaxes. In 2022, over 290,000 calls were made, with 70% of them being invalid. “Such prank calls can take up time from those who are truly experiencing an emergency, and could be at risk of death,” Camilleri said.  “On average, such emergency calls are answered in three seconds, but if we are more efficient in the way we use this helpline we can reduce that time.” Around 89,300 genuine calls were received on the hotline in 2023. The minister was speaking during an event at the Gudja Primary School to mark European 112 Day. School children ranging between the ages of four to 11 had the opportunity to speak to emergency responders to understand the day-to-day roles of the police, nurses, and AFM soldiers. Camilleri was joined by Education Minister Clifton Grima.  This is not the first time the government has pleaded with the public to use 112 responsibly.   Camilleri said 77% of calls- over 68,000- were for paramedics and ambulances.  Another 13% were for the civil protection department, and 10% for police.  A small percentage (2%) of calls required the armed forces to assist.  Grima urged the students to correctly use the hotline and to make sure to share information about it with their family and friends.

Listen to concerned parents of students with disabilities - PN tells government,Claudia Calleja,"The education ministry should not ignore the calls for help by the parents of children with severe disabilities about the lack of resources at the Guardian Angel Secondary Education Resource Centre, the Nationalist Party said.  PN education spokesperson Justin Schembri and inclusion spokesperson Graziella Galea also urged police to speed up investigations into the alleged physical abuse of three students by three educators early last year.  “These allegations are hampering the work being carried out at the resource centre,” they said as they expressed support for staff at the centre.They said they were open to collaborate.  They were reacting to a Times of Malta report in which parents of severely disabled children who attend the state-run secondary education resource centre spoke out about the lack of specially trained staff and resources to cater for the specific needs of students at the school - which forms part of the Dun Gorg Preca College that caters for students between 11 and 16. Unrelated to this, police are investigating allegations of physical abuse by three educators on severely disabled students at the same centre. The alleged abuse, which dates back to early last year, involved spraying the non-verbal students with “a liquid” and hitting one student on the head, according to sources. The educators have been suspended. The matter was flagged during a parliamentary question by PN MP Justin Schembri.  Meanwhile, concerned parents said their children had to spend weeks or months out of school either because they were suspended for challenging behaviour, or because they feared for their children’s health and safety if they were sent to the centre. They said this was also leading to the burn out of dedicated staff. Commissioner for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rhoda Garland confirmed that the commission received several reports from parents of students at Guardian Angel and agreed that the centre had a lack of LSEs and therapeutic professionals to meet the needs of children with challenging behaviour. The Education Ministry, however issued a statement in which it denied that there is a lack of human resources at the centre, including LSEs. On Wednesday Education Minister Clifton Grima said that the resources requested by the resource centre were always granted and the student-to-educator ratio was according to policy. This was one class teacher and three LSEs for eight students.   He said the ministry was looking into concerns - that previous methods might need to be revised - and last month it nominated a fact-finding board to evaluate the actual situation inside the school and provide recommendations by the end of this month. The National Strategy for Education, which is in its final consultation phase, will “transform” the sector and will cover all its needs, the ministry said in the statement. The Malta Union of Teachers defended educators saying it was “unacceptable that individuals, who have no idea what it takes to run an educational institution, seek all possible ways to bring the school to its knees, at the detriment of educators and students.” In reaction to this Rebecca Bonello, a former parent representative on the school board who pulled out her 12-year-old son for safety concerns, said parents had been battling for more resources for a year. If there were no issues with resources, she said, “Can I kindly ask… why the music room and lab are closed? Can I also ask why a multi-sensory was done this year and why there is no calm room?....Children have been suspended and parents have been forced to give their children medication…. We had to stop our son’s education because it was effecting his mental health,” she said. Meanwhile, MaltaCAN - a voluntary organisation made up of 14 organisations advocating the promotion and support of children’s rights - said it was ""deeply troubled by the escalating segregation of children on the autism spectrum in Malta"". “This is a serious concern when taking into consideration the 180 pending applications from students who are currently waiting for a learning support educator,” it said. It added that the lack of data and research into the current situation underscored the urgency of addressing the issue promptly to ensure the right to education for every child.

"Maltese farmers are angry at the EU, not the government - Robert Abela",Daniel Ellul,"Maltese farmers are disgruntled with the EU not the government, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Tuesday.  ""I spoke with farmers and herdsmen. Most of their qualms are with regulations made by the European Commission,"" Abela said.  The prime minister was speaking days after Maltese farmers joined European protests over EU policies they say threaten their livelihoods. Those policies include EU trade deals that remove or reduce trade barriers for agricultural products from non-EU countries with laxer regulations and EU state aid rules that forbid governments from financially helping farmers.  In a bid to calm tensions, the European Commission said on Tuesday that it would be scrapping a law that would have slashed the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture.  Abela briefed parliament on Tuesday evening following a European Council summit held on Monday and Tuesday that discussed the farmers' protest, the war in Ukraine and the war in Gaza, among other topics. Abela said European institutions should do more to listen to the concerns of European citizens.    ""Institutions should leave the comfort of their offices and understand people's realities; if not, we will have regulations that rarely make sense,"" Abela said.  ""Regularly, European regulations look good on paper but in practice rarely make sense,"" he said.  Abela said farmers support the government, which he described as a shoulder for the agricultural sector to lean on.   He made no mention of his meeting with the European Commissioner for Agriculture just a few days before last week's protest by farmers.   Abela's statement was sharply rebutted by PN leader Bernard Grech, who said Abela was happy to criticise the EU in Malta, but failed to say that his government voted in favour of the EU policies farmers are protesting. ""Where was the government when these decisions were being taken?"" Grech asked. ""The government accepted these measures but now acts like it's all the EU's fault,"" he said.    While the PN constantly talks with the agricultural sector, Abela only went to speak with farmers on Friday when the government failed to stop the protests, Grech said.   RELATED STORIES  In a parliamentary speech that adopted a critical tone towards European institutions, Abela deplored what he said was the different way in which the EU had responded to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.  While the EU rightly remained firm in its support for Ukraine against Russia, it has had a ""diametrically opposed"" position for Gaza, he said.  ""The EU has been completely silent on the Middle East; this sends a message that a life there means less than in other war-torn areas,"" he said.  Abela said that the EU should use all its tools to stop aggression in the Middle East, just like it did with aggressors in other parts of the world. He said Malta will continue calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.  Grech said that the opposition and government have the same position on this issue.

"Sandra Ramirez stabbed 26 times using supermarket-bought knife, court told",Edwina Brincat,"Murder victim Sandra Ramirez was stabbed and slashed 26 times using a knife her ex-partner bought the previous day from a supermarket, a court heard on Tuesday. Ramirez was found dead on a bed inside a rental apartment on Triq Sir George Borg, Sliema on January 13. Her ex-boyfriend Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada stands accused of murdering her. Prosecutors told a court on Tuesday that the murder weapon was likely a blue Tescoma knife which Garcia Parada purchased together with two bottles of wine one day before the murder. A receipt for that purchase from Pavi supermarket in Qormi was found inside the apartment where Ramirez’s body was found. CCTV footage from the supermarket showed the accused there on the afternoon of January 12, holding the knife and wine he was buying. The knife was found in a plastic tray in the apartment’s kitchen. It appeared to have been washed but some traces of blood were still visible, Inspector Wayne Camilleri told the court. The case against Garcia Parada got off to a false start at the first hearing, when his lawyers challenged an anti-femicide law they claimed breached their client’s fundamental rights. On Tuesday, Magistrate Monica Vella turned down their request to refer their complaint to the constitutional court and proceeded to hear evidence. Lead investigator Wayne Camilleri testified that he received a call from the police control room at around 6:20am on January 13 about the suspected murder. A man had walked into the Sliema police station, mobile phone in hand with a message in Spanish translated via app into English. The message read “I murdered my ex-partner during an argument inside my home,” and included an address in Sliema. The man was frisked, handcuffed and read his legal rights in Spanish. Meanwhile, a sergeant headed to that Sliema address and entered the apartment using keys found on the suspect. Inside, the officer found a “macabre scene”. A woman was lying face-up on a bed inside the bedroom at the far end of the one-bedroom flat. She was covered from head to toe in a white throw that was visibly bloodstained. The sergeant, who also testified on Tuesday, told the court that he had pulled down the throw, to possibly administer first aid. But it was too late: she was certified dead by an emergency doctor who arrived on site. A post-mortem examination carried out later that day confirmed that she had been stabbed and slashed 26 times. Inspector Camilleri told the court that the suspect was also carrying another mobile phone when he gave himself in. The phone belonged to the murder victim, Ramirez. Garcia Parada told a police constable at the Sliema police station that he and Ramirez had dated for two years and that he had proposed to her in Paris. He referred to her as his “girlfriend” and said the two were happy together. But he went silent when shown a photo of his ex with a new man, and turned the photo upside down. When asked who that man was, the accused to the police that “he didn’t know and didn’t want to know.” Shown images of the victim at the murder scene, the accused “seemed more interested in what he was to wear and to brush his teeth,” Camilleri testified. The accused did not speak when shown a photo of the murder weapon, when asked about his relationship with the accused or why he had killed her. He told the police that he was a teacher in Colombia, his home country, but did not speak English and therefore worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant in Qormi.   Inspector Camilleri told the court that the suspect communicated with a police constable at the police station via Google Translate. The constable said he stopped speaking to the suspect the moment he asked for a lawyer.  RELATED STORIES  Garcia Parada had a cut on his hand, and Inspector Camilleri said he instructed his subordinates to stop him from washing his hands until he was tested by forensic experts. His clothes and shoes were also preserved for DNA testing. Police spoke to people who knew both Ramirez and Garcia Parada, who said Ramirez had split up with the accused but allowed him to continue living at the Sliema apartment until he found somewhere else to stay. Ramirez slept in the bedroom while Garcia Parada slept in the living room, friends told police. Moreover, Ramirez had a new boyfriend, possibly a taxi driver. The court was told that Ramirez, the murder victim, entered the Sliema apartment at 7.57pm on the evening before she was killed. At 9.20pm, one of her friends also went to the apartment. Seven minutes later, the two women stepped outside and got into a vehicle, possibly a cab. Ramirez returned to the apartment at 12:46am on January 13. That was when she was last seen alive. Garcia Parada was inside the apartment at that time: CCTV footage captured him walking into it roughly one hour earlier, at 11.53pm. Earlier that day, he was seen entering Pavi Supermarket at 4.14pm on January 12, and then at a supermarket cashier buying two bottles of wine and a knife nine minutes later. The accused walked out of the Sliema apartment at 6:07am on January 13. He went back inside a minute later and quickly emerged again. At 6.22am he entered the Sliema police station. At the end of the siting, the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella declared that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to face trial on indictment. Tuesday’s hearing began two-and-a-half hours late, because prison officials failed to escort the accused to court. The magistrate noted that it was the second time in five days that an accused person was not brought to court for a scheduled hearing, and ordered the director of prisons to provide an explanation at the next court hearing. AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Kaylie Bonett prosecuted together with Inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Michael Vella. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Yanika Bugeja, Matthew Xuereb and Edward Camilleri are defence counsel. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are appearing parte civile.

Renowned make-up artist warns against false claims of mortuary services,Jessica Arena,"Renowned make-up artist Shasha Fabri has warned clients to be wary of claims that her services are being used for mortuary make-up after being informed of an undertaker service falsely billing clients for her work.  In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Fabri told her followers that unless they had heard from her directly, they should not believe claims that she had billed them for make-up on a deceased person.  Speaking to Times of Malta, Fabri later explained that she had been contacted by a friend who thanked her for doing make-up on her deceased grandmother.  But Fabri said she hadn’t provided make-up services for a mortuary case in “a long time”.  “I only found out because ironically, a friend of mine sent a message thanking me for working on her nanna who had passed away,” Fabri said.  “I hadn’t worked on anybody’s nanna like that for a very long time. It’s not very common I only do it once in a while. And when we discovered that the dates didn’t match up, she told me that the undertaker had billed the family for my services.”  It later transpired that this was the third time that her name was deceptively used in this way.     Asked if she intended to pursue the matter with the police, Fabri said that, while she had an idea about who may be behind these claims, she was not currently in possession of irrefutable evidence.  The friend who initially flagged the discrepancy was reluctant to furnish her with details and Fabri said that she did not want to land her friend in hot water.  She expressed anger and shock that someone would try to take advantage of people who had recently lost a loved one.  “It’s very sad and it is not right,” she said.

"Turkish foreign minister discusses bilateral, regional issues in Malta visit",Times of Malta,"Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had talks in Valletta on Tuesday with Prime Minister Robert Abela and Foreign Minister Ian Borg. The government said they discussed trade relations, cooperation in renewable energy, migration, Malta's presidency of the OSCE, the situation in the Gaza Strip and Turkey's latest mediation efforts to ensure the supply of grain from Ukraine.  Foreign Minister Fidan also paid a courtesy call on President George Vella.  On Sunday Fidan confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit Turkey in the coming days.

Road cutting through Paola Square to be resurfaced,Times of Malta,"A road that crosses Paola’s main square is to be dug up and resurfaced after sustaining “considerable” damage, Infrastructure Malta said. The area stretching from Triq Ħal Luqa to Piazza Antoine De Paule in Paola will be resurfaced in works starting on Thursday evening. The works will be carried out after 7pm where possible and will last a week. Infrastructure Malta advised motorists to follow temporary road signage and use alternative routes where possible. A spokesperson for the state agency said works would only involve resurfacing the road, not the town square itself.    News of the roadworks prompted a strong reaction from the Nationalist Party, which noted that poor administration had turned Paola Square into a money pit of taxpayer funds. The square was redesigned and rebuilt through a €3 million project and reopened to the public five years ago. That project, however, immediately drew criticism, as large mature ficus trees were uprooted and replaced with saplings. The project’s architect had defended that decision, saying the ficus trees were damaging underground utilities. In a statement on Tuesday, the PN said that works on the square had been shoddy from the start. Paving had come loose, parts of the street had sunk and fountains in the square barely ever functioned, the Opposition party said. “It’s good that work to fix the disaster is finally happened, but the people should know who is responsible for all this and who is going to making up for it,” PN MP Mark Anthony Sammut said.

Sofia's mother demands explanations after Gżira façade collapse,Times of Malta,"Isabelle Bonnici, whose son Jean Paul Sofia died in a construction site collapse in Corradino in 2022, hit out at the authorities on Tuesday in the wake of the collapse of a façade in Gżira. No one was injured when the structure collapsed into a street but Bonnici in a Facebook post asked whether the authorities were waiting for the inquiry report into the Corradino collapse before doing anything.    Had no one checked anything before the latest collapse, she asked. ""Were the contractors qualified? Did the architect do his work well? Did the relevant government departments go about their duties?  Were safety checks carried out?  Who would be held accountable for this serious shortcoming?"" She said that Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, now responsible for the sector needed to explain what had been done, and what would be done.  The minister was also asked about the incident by Labour MP Davinia Sammut Hili during question time in parliament.  Replying, the minister said that in the wake of the incident the Building Construction Authority had blocked bank guarantees made by the developer, in case claims for damage were made by third parties. The BCA would also investigate if the method statement submitted before the works started had been adhered to. A stop order on the works had been issued and the case was also being investigated by the Occupational Health and Safety Authority, Attard said.

Identità boss Mark Mallia lined up to replace ousted Carmen Ciantar at FMS,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Identità CEO Mark Mallia is being lined up to replace Carmen Ciantar as head of the Foundation for Medical Services (FMS). Ciantar, a close political aide to former health minister Chris Fearne, will not have her term renewed by the new minister, even though she has not yet been officially informed of the termination. The change comes weeks after a surprise Cabinet reshuffle in which Jo Etienne Abela replaced Fearne as health minister. Fearne will be Malta’s nominee as EU commissioner later this year.  All heads of government entities are expected to submit their resignation letters once a minister is replaced. As FMS CEO, Ciantar did so following the cabinet reshuffle. It is understood that the new health minister has chosen to accept the resignation and assign the FMS, which runs healthcare projects in Malta, new leadership.  Mallia has occupied several managerial posts and also served as Armed Forces of Malta Deputy Commander. He also spent five years as the right-hand man of former President George Abela. Ciantar led Fearne's successful Labour deputy leadership campaign in 2017, a year after she took on the role of CEO at FMS. Her appointment proved controversial after it emerged that she was being paid €163,000 a year to do that job, sparking the Nationalist Party to call on the government to cancel that lucrative deal.  Last year, Ciantar was in the headlines after a Pakistani news website claimed she was the beneficiary of a huge bribe by the people behind Vitals Healthcare, at a time when the company was negotiating the hospitals' deal with the government. The website claimed Ciantar received €443,500 from Gozo International Medicare Ltd – part of the VGH group – in less than four months. VGH was handed the running of the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals in 2015. Ciantar had denied the claims, noting that she was not employed by the foundation at the time alleged by the website, and saying she was being framed as part of a “dirty campaign” to discredit Fearne. She temporarily suspended herself from the role before two months later  returning to her post. A Brussels-based website that echoed the Pakistani news report publicly disavowed the claims some months later.  Over the past months, Ciantar testified in a magisterial inquiry concerning the hospital privatisation deal and also urged police to investigate the corruption claims.  By September, police had formally informed Ciantar that they had concluded exhaustive investigations into bribery allegations and there were “no grounds for any criminal action"" against her.

Suspected thief wore shoes stolen from Valletta store,Times of Malta,"A suspected thief was arrested in Sliema wearing shoes stolen from a Valletta store during a violent incident on January 29, a court heard on Tuesday. Prosecuting inspector Daryl Borg explained that a pair of shoes were stolen from a shop in Merchants' Street during an incident where damage was caused to the shop and a shop assistant was injured.   Working on CCTV footage from the crime scene, the police produced stills which were uploaded to the police system. Police officers on patrol in Sliema spotted the man who allegedly matched the suspect and arrested him. He was wearing the same shoes that were reported stolen, said the prosecutor. The accused, Johan Armando Sanchez Arias, a 27-year-old Colombian, was charged with aggravated theft, slightly injuring the shop assistant as well as causing wilful damage to third-party property. He initially pleaded guilty but after being granted time to reconsider changed his mind, pleading not guilty instead. No request for bail was made and  Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi remanded him  in custody. AG lawyer Manuel Grech and Inspector Daryl Borg prosecuted. Lawyer Alexia Vassallo was legal aid counsel.

Love Island Malta is looking for season two contestants,Giulia Magri,"Love Island Malta has opened applications for the second season of the popular TV dating show.  Single people searching for a summer of love - and who are prepared to be scrutinised by the public in the process - can put themselves forward for a chance to be on the show. Love Island Malta, a local iteration of the UK-led reality franchise, follows the “islanders” as they compete for the prize money by coupling up and surviving the public vote eliminations. Last year's show was a huge success, with almost a third of the country - 160,000 people - tuning in to watch the first episode.  Season 2 of Love Island Malta will return in May and promises a bigger luxury villa than last season.  The crowned couple can take home €20,000.  Love Island Malta announced that applications were open via a social media post.   Anyone interested in applying must be aged at least 18 years old at the date of the application and must not be employed by Media Exclusive Limited.  Last year, in the first season, Chelsea Bagnall-Falzon and Allen Piscopo were crowned winners of the first seasons of Love Island Malta. Two weeks later, the couple announced they had split up. The first season was not without controversy, even before the show started to air when producers had been forced to ask online commentators to “be kind” after contestants received a slew of insults.  One Love Island Malta contestant, Rani Dahl, left the show after only two days citing health concerns. She then claimed that producers were threatening to take legal action for not disclosing her OnlyFans page, as well as her medical issues. Rani was the second contestant to quit the show of her own volition, after Sabrina Grima left following a week at the villa, saying she needed to do so for the sake of her own mental health.

Times of Malta targeted in major DDoS cyberattack,Times of Malta,"Cybercriminals targeted the Times of Malta website on Tuesday morning, flooding its servers with millions of requests within a short span of time. No source has been identified in the attack, which is unprecedented for Malta's largest website.  The attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, began at roughly 6am and was brought under control at around 9.30am. At its peak, the DDoS overloaded Times of Malta servers and breached existing protections in place, causing the website to go offline for most of our readers for a 45-minute period. The attack was a purely external one and no data breach is suspected. “The attack lasted several hours but thanks to our tech team’s work to mitigate it, end users were only impacted for a brief period,” Times of Malta online editor Bertrand Borg said. Times of Malta has now introduced additional layers of protection to guard against a repeat attack. IT teams are continuously monitoring website traffic to take further action should that be necessary. “We’re keeping mitigation measures in place for now,” Borg said. “That means browsing our site may be a bit slower than usual. Users might also notice an unusual Cloudflare screen appear when accessing our site. That is simply an additional protective check, to make it harder for attackers to flood our servers. We apologise for the inconvenience.” Times of Malta has reported the cyberattack to the police, who are investigating. DDoS attacks seek to disrupt website traffic by overwhelming servers with access requests. They are one of the most common types of cyberattacks. Cybercriminals take control of compromised computer systems anywhere in the world and direct them to storm their target. The result is a server overload, much like a road becoming gridlocked when multiple cars all enter it at the same time.

PN says Malta needs a second national hospital,Daniel Ellul,"Malta ""definitely"" needs a new general hospital, health shadow minister Adrian Delia said on Tuesday.  The PN MP was reacting to comments by Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela, who said last week that Malta needs a new national hospital to keep up with the country's growing population. Abela said the Guardamangia area that includes St Luke's and Karin Grech hospitals is ideally placed to serve that function as part of a broader ""health village"". On Tuesday, Delia said: ""I definitely agree with him (Abela) that there is a need for a second hospital"". He said the PN has no issue with that second hospital being located at St Luke's, or of having the private sector involved in running it - something the minister also suggested. The PN's battle, he said, was against awarding the contract to run the dilapidated hospital to Vitals Global Healthcare, not against restoring the hospital and putting it to use.  Because of that experience, the government needs to be transparent in how any eventual private sector involvement occurs, the PN MP noted.     ""We need to know exactly what will happen, in how much time, who will be in charge of the project, and that the project actually happens,"" Delia said.  As it stands, the minister's plans seem vague, he said.  ""The minister should say exactly what his plans are, and we, as the Opposition, are willing to sit with him, listen, participate and share our ideas,"" Delia said.  The shadow minister made his comments during a press conference he held alongside PN primary health spokesperson Ian Vassallo. They were speaking about the state of Malta's health care.  They said that a lack of space, long waiting lists for operations, prescribed medicines not being available in the government formula, and a lack of human resources were serious problems in the health system. Delia said that the health system is close to breaking point, and more investment in healthcare was needed to keep up with current and future demands.   ""For those waiting for an operation that hasn't happened, the system is already broken, and those waiting for an intervention that never happened because they died waiting, they surpassed the breaking point,"" he said.

"Building façade, scaffolding collapse onto Gżira street",Sarah Carabott,"Updated 3.10pm Scaffolding and the façade of a construction site crashed onto Triq Belvedere in Gżira on Tuesday afternoon, missing pedestrians by metres.   The police confirmed that the collapse was reported at around 1.30pm. Rescue workers were immediately on site searching for any injured people.   Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said on Facebook that according to initial reports, no one was harmed. The site is being developed into a 116-room, nine-floor hotel, according to a planning permit issued in 2021 (PA 08659/21). Developer Kris Calleja and architect Colin Zammit applied to demolish various properties on Triq Belvedere to build the hotel, which will include a new façade identical to the existing one in the interest of “maintaining visual rhythm” of the streetscape.  According to publicly available documents, the Building and Construction Authority issued a stop notice on Tuesday afternoon after the collapse, ""except to render the site safe"".   A man who was walking in Triq Belvedere at the time of the collapse said he was roughly 10 metres away when the scaffolding surrounding the building gave way and the masonry of the facade followed swiftly, crashing into the balcony of the house across the street and spilling into the street below. “I was listening to music on headphones but the sound the crash made was huge and there was dust billowing everywhere,” said the Gżira resident, who asked not to be named. He added that he and another pedestrian who also witnessed the collapse were frozen in shock and consoled each other after potentially being seriously injured.   “The worst thing is that it's almost not surprising that this happened because it seems to be happening everywhere,” the witness continued. “This building has been in this state - just a façade holding on for dear life - for ages. It should be either demolished or preserved, but not left in this sorry state.” He added that he was grateful it did not appear that anyone had been injured. “It could have turned out much worse for me if I was just a couple of metres closer, or even worse - it could have happened later in the day when I take the same walk with my children,” he said.   Publicly available documents show that the hotel project was initially recommended for refusal by a PA case officer, who deemed it to be too high and with too many floors.  The PA case officer also noted that the proposed building did not comply with the necessary sanitary regulations.    However, the PA planning board later decided that the reasons for the refusal had been subsequently addressed by the applicant and voted to approve the permit. According to publicly available documents, the site was cleared for work to begin last November.        You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Police find 10 people illegally working in Paceville establishments over weekend,Times of Malta,"Over the weekend the police arrested 10 people who were either working without a bouncer's license or a work permit in Paceville. The police said in a statement five of these people are from Serbia, three from North Macedonia, one from Bulgaria and another one from Bangladesh. The arrests follow inspections at 24 establishments over the weekend.  In some places they found people working as bouncers without the required license to work at entertainment establishments. In other places they found people working there without a permit to work in Malta.  RELATED STORIES  The police officers were assisted by detention services officials and JobsPlus officers.  The inspections come a few weeks after a group of security guards were caught on camera beating a man lying on the ground and kicking him repeatedly in the head.  The beating led to the arrest of three people – including the victim – and has seen renewed talk about safety in Paceville with stakeholders wondering whatever had become of 2019 plans for reform in the licensing of bouncers. In 2019, former minister Michael Farrugia had told Times of Malta that under his tenure, the ministry had begun discussions with stakeholders about the matter. Last month, the Home Affairs Ministry twice sidestepped the issue and ignored questions by Times of Malta. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Do not eat these blueberries as they might be contaminated: health authorities,Times of Malta,"People are being warned not to consume frozen blueberries that come in Freshona packets of 500g as the fruit could contain a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhoea. The product is called mirtilli giganti americani, forms part of the LP3144DL7 lot and expires in May of 2025. The Environmental Health Directorate within the Superintendence of Public Health on Tuesday urged people not to consume the blueberries because of a ""potential contamination with Norovirus"". Norovirus, it explained, causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. An infection with the virus can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach pain. Less common symptoms are low fever, chills, and headache. Vomiting can be sudden and frequent resulting in remarkable fluid loss.

"PL MEP candidate asks police to investigate man over Muscat, Abela 'hate speech'",Times of Malta,"Updated 3pm with Robert Aquilina comment A Labour MEP candidate has asked the police to investigate a man who insulted Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela on Facebook for hate speech. Daniel Attard filed a police report on Tuesday morning, arguing that Godfrey Leone Ganado had breached Article 82A of the Criminal Code in two comments he published online on Monday. Leone Ganado wrote of Muscat and Abela that he hoped “the unexplained wealth they accumulated off our backs will crumble to dust and bury them together with their families in a pit of smelly shit”.  In a subsequent comment, he added: “When dealing with this trash you need to call a spade a spade, and after all, you need a spade to lift shit”. Leone Ganado posted those comments beneath a post published by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina. Aquilina said he dissociated himself and Repubblika from the comments and Leone Ganado, and that he had deleted the comments as soon as he became aware of them.  The comments drew criticism from various quarters on social media, and on Tuesday morning Attard said he wanted Leone Ganado, whom he described as “part of the extremist Repubblika clique”, prosecuted. “I will insist on action being taken against anyone who thinks they are above the law, and to ensure justice is equal for all,” Attard said following his criminal report.   Leone Ganado is no stranger to controversy: in 2020 he lost a libel suit after he likened MP Rosianne Cutajar to a prostitute. “Hamalli, prostitutes and call girls have a right to be represented in parliament,” he wrote of the Qormi MP. A magistrate ruled that the comment impinged on Cutajar’s reputation and ordered Leone Ganado to pay her €800 in damages. Repubblika president Robert Aquilina clarified on Tuesday afternoon that Leone Ganado was not a member of Repubblika. He quit the association after  being threatened with expulsion when he made similar comments in the past, Aquilina said.

Watch: Why I’m opening my introverted grandfather’s art studio to the public,Fiona Galea Debono,"TAMARA FENECH, the granddaughter of artist Frank Portelli tells Fiona Galea Debono why she is inviting audiences behind the scenes of a low-key pioneer of modern art in Malta. Frank Portelli was a private man with “quiet energy” but his meticulous approach to documenting his art has convinced his granddaughter Tamara Fenech to fling open to the public the doors of his former studio. Twenty years after his death, audiences of the interdisciplinary project Frank u Jien (Frank and I) will get a glimpse into the mind of Portelli, a co-founder of the Malta Modern Art Circle in 1951. The sold-out project, supported by the Arts Council Malta, takes place in the late artist’s studio-archive in Attard between February 15 and 25. Portelli distinguished himself not only as an artist but also as an interior designer, and became renowned for two important artistic developments, known as Crystallised Cubism and his Contours series. His seminal work is La Vie (1951), which depicts a pivotal episode in his life – the death of his father as a result of a botched-up surgical intervention seven years earlier. The artist left behind a lifetime treasure trove of all his possessions, from diaries to notebooks and sketches to captioned photographs, in his intact original studio above the house he designed. “We are lucky we have the space. Unfortunately, there are many beautiful buildings like artist Emvin Cremona’s just round the corner that are derelict,” Fenech said.   “As a family, we are trying to set models for others to do the same because I believe there must be so many untapped archives on the island.” It is not the first private archive that has been made public, but it is the first time a family is taking the initiative to do this themselves, rather than donate it to a foundation. While he was a very private man, Portelli’s meticulous approach to recording everything was a sign that he wanted to exhibit it, his granddaughter maintains. Fenech has fond memories of her grandfather, who died when she was 12. She admitted to an internal conflict over whether to open up the space he worked in – and which she has now converted into her home. “It has been one of my biggest challenges throughout this whole archiving journey over the past three years, especially now that we are coming up to the show.   “I keep coming to the question, which has given me some anxiety: How can I still honour him and his quiet, selective and high-principled nature, while celebrating his work?” Fenech has been reassured by family members and collaborators that leaving an archive like he did behind meant nannu had intentions for something to happen with it. “I will always be checking in with this; not straying too far away from what nannu is… He was not able to promote himself in the way we believe he deserved. “I am no expert in archiving, but with the experience I have had over the last three years, I understand that opening up an untapped archive is a massive and daunting experience for a family member,” Fenech said. “Nannu died 20 years ago, and it is only now that we can share fragments of his archive,” she added.   “When an artist leaves this world and his studio intact, for the family to go through, that is a big emotional toll,” Fenech said. Other challenges included finding funding and the energy for the task.   “I feel that serendipity got me here; that nannu literally picked me and placed me.” The fact her family was open to her idea was a big push, Fenech said. Portelli would spend every single waking hour in his studio, his “safe haven and sacred space”. “It was full of things everywhere – a proper artist’s studio; super organised but with that creative messiness that only he would be able to understand what was where.   “I always felt curious and intrigued by ‘what is in all these boxes and on these shelves’,” she said. “I always felt there was way more than his body of work in this space, and with the archive now, we are proving there is so much more than just his art.” One thing the team has realised from the archive is that Portelli and his contemporaries wanted to push boundaries. “Even though we are talking about the 1940s and 1950s, we still want the same things; higher standards for our country and for things to change,” Fenech said. “Nannu had a sentiment that Malta was always delayed; having to catch up with the rest of the world. He was concerned about time: Would it be too late once we catch up? He understood we were behind the rest of the world.” When you look at an archive, you must do so in its entirety and see how one thing leads to the next; how his artwork reflects the thoughts in his diary, Fenech said. This was kickstarted in 2007, when researcher and art historian Elizabeth Isabelle Borg did her master’s thesis on Portelli and spent four years in his studio as he left it when he died in 2004.   His archive shows that at a time when artists were mostly commissioned by the Church, Portelli was pushing boundaries and bringing politics into his art. It was a time when a new generation of artists started bringing in social issues, and Portelli did not shy away from this because art had to have meaning. The books he read were always a bit more “forward”, as were the lights and furniture the interior designer used to import. The upcoming theatrical performance, Frank u Jien (Frank and I), is aimed at bringing Portelli to today’s public and is not just a personal project. “We also know that when you share such a big body of work, there is room for inspiration for those receiving it and it also closes the gaps on history of art in Malta, particularly in that period,” Fenech explained.   Antoine Camilleri, Gabriel Caruana, Victor Diacono and a bit later Pawl Carbonaro were all “giants” in that era, but Portelli was always the more reserved. Frank u Jien started in 2020 in the run-up to Portelli’s centenary in 2022, as a research and development project, involving curator Andrew Borg Wirth. “I did not want a white-wall exhibition with his paintings and a placard explaining them. So, we went for a site-specific piece in this space. I had just moved in, so I was not super attached to my home and that helped,” Fenech recounts. The focus is the beginning of the 1950s, when Portelli had just returned from London, got married, had his first child and painted La Vie. Ten artifacts that helped the writing of the script were picked out and will be part the setting – an intimate theatre in the round. The sold-out performance, directed by Becky Camilleri with a script in Maltese by Maria Theuma, lies between theatre and exhibition, and the programme also includes an archive tour and public lecture.

Europol expert says he was never told to submit Caruana Galizia report to court,Edwina Brincat,"A Europol expert who six years ago was tasked to extract data from Daphne Caruana Galizia’s cloned mobile phone, never reported directly back to the court because he “was never asked to.” Constantinos Petrou was in court on Monday at the re-opened compilation of evidence against Yorgen Fenech who stands charged with complicity in the journalist’s murder. He was one of a number of experts appointed by the magistrate conducting the inquiry into the fatal car bomb that killed Caruana Galizia a few metres away from her Bidnija home on October 16, 2017. On November 23, 2017 then-Magistrate Anthony Vella had named Petrou as the expert to extract data from the victim’s cloned mobile phone as well as a related hard drive. The victim’s actual phone was destroyed in the blast. Four days after that appointment, the cloned phone together with the hard drive were handed to Petrou by digital forensic expert, lawyer Martin Bajada, at Europol headquarters at The Hague. Petrou completed the extractions and handed over his work to the weapons and explosives unit at Europol. The relative report was subsequently incorporated into another report drawn up by his former colleague, Marinus Martin Van Der Meij, who last Thursday presented his report at Fenech’s murder case. That report, based on the extracted data, came up with seven possible scenarios and possible instigators behind Caruana Galizia’s assassination, the court heard last week. Petrou’s own report was included as ‘Appendix 16’ under Van Der Meij’s report and was dated March 28, 2018. Van Der Meij had completed his data analysis in May. Asked by Fenech’s lawyer whether he had ever presented his report to the Maltese courts, Petrou replied, “No, I was never asked.” Nor was he ever told to report back to the inquiring magistrate, he said. The experts’ conclusions were handed in physical format to the inquiring magistrate by his former colleague, Van Der Meij. When shown a copy of the document that was removed from its sealed envelope by presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello, Petrou confirmed that it was his report and that he had completed his task faithfully, to the best of his abilities. Petrou said the cloned phone was handed to him by Bajada together with a court order, in Maltese, setting out his task.  Bajada explained the instructions to him, the witness said. He also said that he never communicated with the magistrate who had appointed him.  Petrou said he did not need to report to his manager on this occasion, as preparing the data for the analyst was “an everyday task”.  Asked by defence lawyer Charles Mercieca about the extracted data and the original exhibits he had worked on, Petrou said, one needed to ask Europol because he did not work for Europol any more.  The court pointed out that the experts had only been asked to present reports. However, the defence insisted, observing that normally a court expert would include the original exhibits and data used to perform his assigned task. This had clearly not happened in Fenech’s case. The defence observed that neither Van Der Meij’s nor Petrou’s testimonies shed light on what had happened to the extractions and exhibits they had worked on. Data had been extracted from the victim’s cloned phone and the relative hard drive was copied but no one knew who those exhibits were handed to. And since they formed the basis of Van Der Meij’s conclusions, it was all the more important for them to be in the records of the murder case, argued Mercieca. Moreover, presenting evidence “in fits and starts” meant more delays to the detriment of his client.   Moreover, Madam Justice Grima had ordered a Europol representative to testify so as to explain why the experts’ report was in possession of the agency which was a third party, extraneous to the proceedings. Mercieca insisted the report must be presented “in its entirety,” in the same manner as any other report produced by a court expert. In light of those submissions, the court remitted the case to the Criminal Court which has to clarify whether the two Europol experts who have already testified need to produce the exhibits they worked on. AG lawyers Anthony Vella and Godwin Cini prosecuted, together with inspector Kurt Zahra. Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran, Charles Mercieca and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. Lawyers Therese Comodini Cachia and Jason Azzopardi appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Claudette Abela Baldacchino seeks a return to the European Parliament,Times of Malta,"Claudette Abela Baldacchino is to seek a return to the European Parliament where she served as Labour MEP between 2013 to 2014.  A former One journalist, Abela Baldacchino later represented Malta as a member of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) of the EU and was vice-president of the Local Councils Association having served as deputy mayor of Qrendi. She was also president of Labour's women's section.   Abela Baldacchino is a graduate in social administration and also holds a Master of Science in governance and management. In 2021 she was among several serving and former mayors and officials from a travel agency and the Local Councils Association who were cleared of fraud that allegedly took place 11 years previously in the purchase of flight tickets. Her husband Kevin announced her nomination in a Facebook post saying she had been asked by Prime Minister Robert Abela to contest the election and after much thought she accepted.  Abela Baldacchino got 12,300 first-count votes in the 2009 election, losing the seat to John Attard Montalto by a few votes. Eventually, she was co-opted to the European Parliament after Louis Grech contested and was elected in the national election.   The world's largest transnational election in June will see more than 400 million eligible voters from 27 European Union countries pick 720 European Parliament members that decide on issues ranging from mobile phone roaming charges to the privacy of online data.

'OSCE could help return abducted Ukrainian children': Latvia president,James Cummings,"The OSCE could be a “good instrument” that helps return Ukrainian children “abducted” by Russia during its war on Ukraine, Latvia's head of state said on Monday. Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs was speaking at St Anton Palace during a state visit, where he met with President George Vella and senior politicians including Prime Minister Robert Abela and Foreign Minister Ian Borg. Saying he was “very pleased” with Malta’s presence on the UN Security Council and its recent appointment to chair the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Rinkēvičs added the latter could be a useful tool to assist displaced Ukrainian children.  “The OSCE could be a good instrument.. to return Russia’s abducted Ukrainian children to their families in their homes. This is where I believe we can step up our efforts,” he said.  In November, Malta was unanimously elected to the chair of the organisation as part of a diplomatic solution to Russia vetoing Estonia’s ascension to the role. Estonia has been a vocal critic of Russia since it invaded Ukraine.  Commenting on Malta’s ascension to the position, Rinkēvičs said the country had taken over the chair of the OSCE during a “very complicated situation”, and said he pledged Latvia’s “full support” to Malta during its time in the role and for its work on the UN Security Council.  Turning to internal European matters, the Latvian president said his country and Malta were “very like-minded” on the issue of EU reform.  “As small nations, we are very like-minded when it comes to reforms. We believe that all the challenges the EU is facing… could be addressed within the existing treaty framework, and not by opening treaty negotiations”, said Rinkēvičs.   On cooperation between Latvia and Malta, Rinkēvičs said the countries were planning on “increasing the level of economic cooperation,” a move also discussed by Vella during his address.  Vella said Malta enjoyed healthy trade with Latvia, with a “good number of Maltese businesses having expanded their operations in Latvia”, adding there was potential for increased activity in sectors including IT, financial services, food processing, metal-working and aviation.

Fact check: Fake video shows Ursula von der Leyen promoting investment scam,| Nicholas Debono Drury,"  Claim: A video shows European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promoting a new citizen investment venture. Verdict: The video uses AI-generated audio to impersonate von der Leyen and trick people into believing that the scheme is genuine. A video shared on Facebook on Friday shows European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen seemingly announcing and endorsing an EU-wide investment scheme targeted at European citizens. Von der Leyen is seen talking about the importance of “improving the living standards of our citizens”, before going on to introduce the European Partnership Investment Programme. The programme, she says, will help “Europeans survive these difficult times”. She explains that the scheme offers European citizens additional income starting at €2,000 per week by investing in established European companies.   The video attracted widespread attention, being viewed thousands of times and quickly racking up hundreds of shares and comments, including many from people asking how to sign up for the scheme. But, although the scheme may appear legitimate at first glance, closer inspection shows that both the video and the scheme’s website are fraudulent. The video is being shared by a Facebook page called Euro Life, which describes itself as an “insurance agent”. The page has very few followers and virtually no content, having only been created on January 30. It uses the EU flag as its profile and cover images, in an apparent attempt to appear genuine. There is no other information listed, aside from a link to the investment website investing.com.   Another, almost identical, page bearing the same name was created on Friday morning, suggesting that the scammers may be intending to share similar fake videos through different channels. This second page bears a strikingly similar layout and description to the first, albeit with a different profile picture. Listed in its contact details, bizarrely, is a German telephone number belonging to a Berlin pub which, several glowing Tripadvisor reviews suggest, specialises in schnitzel.  The video promoting the scam borrows snippets from a February 2020 speech delivered by von der Leyen on shaping Europe’s digital future. In the speech, the EC president spoke about how artificial intelligence can be used to improve people’s daily lives, emphasizing that technology needs to be used responsibly if citizens are to trust it.   In an ironic twist, the video takes excerpts from this speech and maliciously combines it with AI-generated audio promoting the fraudulent scheme, in the hope that viewers will be duped.   As the visuals move from von der Leyen’s real speech to stock footage of shoppers and investment traders, her real voice is replaced by an almost identical AI-generated audio track. The difference between von der Leyen’s voice and the fabricated audio is almost imperceptible for the most part until her formal German accent gradually morphs into a seemingly Australian twang as the video progresses and the details of the scheme are introduced. A link beneath the video takes users to a website detailing how the scheme works. The site asks users to register through an embedded online form. After having submitted their name, email, and phone number, it claims that a specialist will call them with more details and instructions on how to set up a portfolio with which they can start investing. The site assures readers that “the first investment doesn’t have to be large”, going on to suggest that they “start with an amount that you can afford and then multiply it by at least 3 in the future”. It also welcomes readers with an entirely different video, using snippets of international news reports and describing the scheme as “a way out” of the cost of living crisis. The video explains how the scheme will help people “earn dividends from the shares of major European corporations” by investing in major European companies such as BMW or Daimler.    The website also makes several baseless claims about the scheme's monthly earnings (€12,000) and each investor's guaranteed earnings (€300 each day, tax-free). The Euro Life Facebook page frequently repeats these claims in response to questions about the scheme, but it confusingly tends to list the currency as US Dollar, rather than Euro. Once again, the site may seem legitimate at first glance, but upon closer inspection, various formatting errors emerge, together with other clues indicating that the website is fraudulent. For starters, the website's nonsensical URL is unlike any that a legitimate European investment scheme would use. A deeper dig into the website's registration details reveals that it was created using Spaceship, a digital platform which allows users to register a website or domain and keep their registration information off public directories. The site also contains virtually no information aside from instructions on how to sign up for the scheme. It does not contain any information on who is supposedly running the scheme, nor does it list any contact details or names of people involved.   This type of scam is not new. Times of Malta has previously reported on similar scams using known or trusted figures to legitimise and promote fake operations. With the European Parliament elections looming, it wouldn't be a surprise to see European leaders and issues feature more heavily in scams over the coming months. The video is fake and being used to promote a scam. The video uses genuine footage of Ursula von der Leyen and AI-generated audio scripts to imply that she is presenting and endorsing the fraudulent scheme. The scheme’s website reveals how users are asked to register and submit their personal details, telling unsuspecting readers that they can earn a minimum of €300 each day if they are willing to invest their own money into the scheme. A closer inspection of the website reveals several hints indicating that the programme is not genuine. This claim is therefore false, as the evidence clearly refutes the claim.

'We accept criticism but not lies': MUT sues rival UPE over defamation,Edwina Brincat,"The president of the Malta Union of Teachers told court on Monday that while he accepted criticism he could not accept the ""lies"" of a rival education union which MUT is suing for defamation. Last year the Union for Professional Educators' leader Graham Sansone alleged at a press conference that the MUT had secretly struck a deal with the government but was threatening to strike as a “demonstration of power” to its members. At the time, the MUT was locked in collective agreement negotiations with the government. That press conference triggered libel proceedings by MUT against UPE for allegedly “fabricating and spreading defamatory statements”. On Monday, MUT boss Marco Bonnici took the witness stand in the libel suit, providing a timeline of events leading up to the union’s court action and pointing out specific snippets from UPE’s statement which were deemed to be defamatory. When cross-examined by UPE lawyer, Jason Azzopardi, as to whether he “accepted criticism directed against his leadership”, Bonnici replied, “I don’t object to criticism. I object to lies”.  UPE’s statement was a reaction to MUT’s industrial action. “It was intended to disrupt our instructions at a very delicate moment through information that was not true,” said Bonnici. The harm was amplified since their rival’s statements were taken up and reported by all media, creating a “multiplier effect”.  MUT strongly rebutted one particular allegation that the government’s financial proposals had been “accepted by the union”.  Questioned further by Azzopardi, Bonnici said that the government had put forward two proposals to the union and those “were not accepted”.  Pressed to divulge the names of those representing the government in the negotiations, Bonnici was reluctant, while his lawyer, Keith Borg, voiced objections.  The UPE needed those names to defend its claims. “Then I’ll ask him [Bonnici] to present the government’s proposals up to November 11,” suggested Azzopardi.  But again, Bonnici turned down that suggestion.  “See?... Then you shouldn’t have filed the libel,” hit back Azzopardi.  Negotiations were still ongoing and the UPE’s request for those proposals went beyond the scope of the libel, countered the applicant’s lawyer.  “Let’s not allow these proceedings to be used for ulterior motives: to get information which [UPE] has no right to, even in these proceedings,” said Borg.  Azzopardi suggested that the requested proposals could be presented under seal and made accessible only to the court and the parties.  The UPE’s press release ran along the lines that MUT had accepted the government’s proposals, and for MUT not to admit that UPE was right, the MUT “did not wrap up negotiations,” Azzopardi claimed. MUT subsequently filed these proceedings, claiming that what UPE said was not right, but the court could not access this information to assess the veracity of this “cornerstone” issue, went on the respondent’s lawyer.  Such government proposals would doubtlessly be in written form. “Without them the court cannot decide whether UPE expressed an honest opinion,” finished off Azzopardi, stressing that this was crucial to the libel.  However, MUT’s lawyer did not agree, pointing out that he drew “no comfort” as to an ulterior motive, even if the requested proposals were to be presented under seal. The court, presided over by magistrate Rachel Montebello, said that a decision on this point would be delivered in chambers.  The case continues.

MPs to discuss new authority for climate change,Times of Malta,"Parliament will on Tuesday start discussing a bill setting up Malta's first authority monitoring climate action on the island.  Through the proposed Act, the State would acknowledge that change in Earth’s climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind.  The government also binds itself to ensure that all necessary action is taken to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Energy Minister Miriam Dalli on Monday told the media the authority would evaluate policies linked to climate change to ensure that the island's mitigation action was impactful. ""For the first time, Malta will have an authority focused on the action that we need to take collectively as a country. This is a government that is determined to promote sustainable living and we therefore need decisive and coordinated climate action,"" Dalli said.  The minister acknowledged that climate change was piling pressure on the tourism, farming and fishing sectors and the manufacturing industry while also impacting health.  She said such challenges also gave rise to opportunities such as the creation of green economy jobs and the development of new technologies.   The new authority would replace the Malta Resources Authority, while responsibilities linked to resources that are currently within MRA's remit would be passed on to the Environmental Resources Authority.  The Climate Action Authority will be made up of a chairperson and between four and six members. The members will be appointed by the minister for no longer than six years. At least two of the members will have knowledge or experience in matters concerning climate change and climate-related matters. The Authority would, among others: The Bill is also proposing a Climate Action Fund and would separately see the setting up of a National Climate Action Council by the Prime Minister. This will consist of between six and eight people ""who may be independent of the government and who shall be experts in any climate-related fields including scientific, public policy, finance, economic and social fields"".

‘He's the devil and deserves life in prison': Pelin Kaya’s family on murder plea,Giulia Magri,"The sister of Pelin Kaya has described her killer as a ""devil"" who deserves to spend the rest of his life behind bars.  Jeremy Camilleri, 34, pleaded guilty on Monday to the murder of the 30-year-old interior designer. She was mowed down by his BMW car as she walked home along Testaferrata Street, Gżira from a birthday celebration on January 18 last year.  Derya Kaya said she felt no sense of relief after Camillieri changed his plea to guilty after initially denying the murder charge. She said the family had been prepared ""to fight in any way"" because they already knew that he was a murderer. He had initially tried to overshadow the ""barbaric murder"" by claiming he needed psychiatric tests, she said. “Now everyone knows what we know, he is a murderer, he is a devil, and his every move and every step is deliberate, he is a devil and deserves life imprisonment,” she told Times of Malta.  ""I am aware that no one wants to protect him. I hope justice will be served and they will sentence the devil to prison until he dies.""   Camilleri will be sentenced for the murder at a later date after the case is assigned to a judge. Earlier, their family lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi told awaiting media that the guilty plea would at least spare the family the pain of having to travel from Turkey for court hearings.  ""Nothing will take the pain away. This will not bring their daughter back,"" he said.     In an interview with Times of Malta last month on the anniversary of the murder, Derya Kaya said she had ""absolute faith"" in the Maltese justice system and that Camilleri would be punished in the ""harshest"" manner.  She described her sister as the ""jewel of the family"". Camilleri, 34, was arrested in Gżira shortly after he mowed down Kaya and smashed his BMW into a fuel station and KFC restaurant just after 2am.  He later told the police that he “wanted to be famous” and that he was “a psychopath and proud”.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"X Factor elimination of non-Maltese nationals shocks judge, audience, singers",Sarah Carabott,"The elimination of two foreign singers from X Factor Malta shocked viewers on Sunday, with several claiming they were kicked out of the competition after a televoting audience favoured Maltese semi-finalists.  Rose Marielle Mamaclay, a Filipino singer who has dominated the show for weeks, was eliminated on Sunday’s semi-final, together with Sean Kamati, who is from Namibia. It comes after weeks of comments posted on social media urging viewers to 'penalise' the singers to ensure that a Maltese national wins the fourth season of the show.   X Factor judge and producer Howard Keith Debono himself said he was ""uncomfortable"" with Sunday's result.  ""Unfortunately, there’s an alarming number of people who always complain about foreigners living or working in Malta, threatening our jobs and yet we equally complain that the Maltese don’t want to do certain jobs such as health carers in old people’s homes, housekeeping, cab driving, construction work, etc. ""We’re okay with [non-Maltese doing] these jobs as their minimal salaries are squeezed to the last cent, but when it comes to a top job, a top place, or a €50,000 prize, we just can’t swallow it,"" he posted on social media on Monday.     Sunday's outcome was ""an obvious case of eliminating two top potential winners cause God forbid it was won by a non-Maltese national"", Debono charged. ""This is called hypocrisy and nothing to be proud of, but rather ashamed of. I'm not mincing my words, this was a case of a clear-cut above the rest, a league of their own."" Kamati took to the stage for two consecutive Sundays while recovering from bronchitis.  Debono noted ""there’s no fast recovery for singers with bronchitis so for those isolated idiots who had the audacity to question your talent based on a 50% performance, simply exposes their limited brain power"". In an earlier post, Debono expressed his surprise at the elimination: ""I had faith. I was wrong to have faith that a non-Maltese could win.""   Musician and former Malta Eurovision winner Ludwig Galea backed Debono: ""We don’t see eye to eye most of the time but on this one he’s right and on point. ""What The Fluff is happening Malta,"" he asked on Facebook. Oliver Scicluna, a former MP and breakdancer also had his say: ""for some reason, in a singing competition in which [Mamaclay] should have been among the finalists, if not the winner, she was suddenly eliminated before the final... I don't understand.""   TV producer and actress Dulcima Aquilina added her voice to the public outcry on Monday, saying Mamaclay and Sean were eliminated ""just because they are not Maltese and did not get enough votes"".   She said the eliminations should have included the judges' say, as in previous years. ""Mamaclay, you are the X Factor winner (maybe not the Maltese one) but your talent goes beyond,"" she added. Social worker and activist Omar Rababah suggested Mamaclay should consult with a lawyer to request an audit of the voting system. ""I am seeing screenshots of votes intended for her not being delivered and it is very offputting to see the best artist getting the least votes... I really hope there is no foul play,"" he added.     You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Health Minister eyes tougher rules for vapes and HHC products,Giulia Magri,"The health minister has raised concerns about the potential impact of vapes and semi-synthetic cannabinoid products on youths, amid plans to try to make the use of e-cigarettes less appealing to children. “I believe vapes and HHC products are too easily accessible on the market, and I am concerned for our children’s health,” Jo Etienne Abela told Times of Malta. HHC, short for hexahydrocannabinol, is a semi-synthetic cannabidiol, which is extracted from low-THC cannabis (hemp) and is a popular cannabis substitute. In recent months, products containing HHC – gummy bears, cookies and colourful vapes – are being sold in stores across the country as well as food delivery platforms. Unlike THC, which is a regulated by law, HHC exists in a legal grey zone.      Just last month, the Authority for Responsible Use of Cannabis expressed “great concern” that the semi-synthetic cannabinoid products are being sold openly in shops, and raised concerns over unforeseen health risks. Church organisations raised the alarm that children have easy access to HHC products and called on the government to ban the semi-synthetic drug. While Abela did not say if there are plans for a ban, he said he is concerned about the easy access to these products. A meeting has been scheduled with the health authorities and Superintendent of Public Health Charmaine Gauci to discuss the issue. Another topic Abela wishes to discuss is the increasing popularity of vapes, which have been accessible for years. Purchasing disposable vapes locally is easy – they are available in most convenience stores as well as food delivery platforms. Many disposable vapes are sold in colourful packaging and come in countless flavours, including mint and strawberry, making the idea of vaping even more enticing for youths. One 14-year-old who spoke to Times of Malta said it is “super easy” to buy vapes in most outlets. While it is illegal to sell any smoking products to under-18s, the teenager said shop assistants rarely ask for ID when customers want to buy vapes. “As long as you look remotely older than your age, they don’t ask you, and also they tend to let women off more than men,” the teen said. Across the world, countries are discussing or even implementing bans on disposable vaping devices.   Last year, both France and Australia announced plans to ban single-use vapes, and just last week the UK government said it will ban disposable vapes as part of a plan to tackle the rising number of young people vaping. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: “The long-term impacts of vaping are unknown and the nicotine within them can be highly addictive, so while vaping can be a useful tool to help smokers quit, marketing vapes to children is not acceptable.” Abela did not say whether the government should ban disposable vapes.  RELATED STORIES  “I cannot promote vaping or smoking, and if there was an overall ban on smoking it would make my life as health minister much easier, no doubt about it. I would also consider increasing the price of tobacco, but we will discuss everything in these meetings.” Commissioner for Children Antoinette Vassallo welcomed the idea of banning vapes and promoting a smoke-free nation.   “In my opinion, this should include vapes since they consist of chemicals found in cigarettes, including nicotine, which can be addictive, as well as other dangerous chemicals,” she said. She said her office had received messages of concern from parents, educators as well as children on the topic of vapes. “There is a need for enforcement since, even though it is illegal for minors to buy vapes, we are aware that in some cases they do manage to do so,” she said.

MUMN welcomes plans to expand clinical areas at Mater Dei Hospital,Times of Malta,"The nurses' union on Monday welcomed the new Health Minister's proposal of turning St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals into a “health village” while maximising clinical floor area at Mater Dei. On Saturday, Jo Etienne Abela told a radio programme Malta needs a second national hospital to keep up with its growing population.  He told host Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103 that the Gwardamangia area could serve that function: non-clinical services, including the medical school, could be shifted away from Mater Dei to St Luke's and Karin Grech. That would allow ""every nook and cranny"" of Mater Dei to be used for clinical purposes, with the hospital also undergoing enlargement ""where the concrete allows us to"".  On Monday, the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses said it has been calling for new wards at Mater Dei for some time now. ""It is not acceptable to have patients and nurses in corridors or other hospital areas that were never designated as clinical wards,"" the union said.  From when MDH was first ""conceived"", MUMN had insisted that more ""capital projects are needed to elevate the suffering, lack of human dignity and degradation one feels when placed in undesirable areas opened up due to lack of space"". Abela's comments on Saturday were a ""great relief"" for MUMN, which said such capital projects could be launched in collaboration with the private sector just like what had happened in the elderly sector. The new elderly hospital built as an extension to the St Vincent De Paul Residence was ""a success story"", they said.  MUMN said the government should prioritise the renovation of Mount Carmel Hospital as it ""would offer better services than building a mental health hospital next to MDH"". The union added it was eager to work with the Health Minister to address healthcare professional shortages and launch a holistic programme that favoured patients and staff. The union's reaction contrasts with that of medical students, who have said they are concerned about the plan to move them away from the Mater Dei area.

Jeremie Camilleri pleads guilty to murder of Pelin Kaya,Bertrand Borg,"Updated 10.15am with comments A man who intentionally ran over a stranger and then threw stones at her dead body has pleaded guilty to murder. Jeremie Camilleri on Monday admitted to having killed Pelin Kaya in January 2023, reversing his initial not guilty plea. Speaking calmly and clearly, Camilleri answered ‘yes’ when asked by Magistrate Rachel Montebello if he was sure he wanted to plead guilty.   His case will now be sent to a criminal court judge, who will sentence him. Camilleri faces up to a lifetime sentence in prison, though defence lawyers told the court that they had reached an agreement with all parties, including the victim's family.  That suggests the defence and prosecution have agreed terms of a plea deal for the accused.  In her first reaction to the verdict, Derya Kaya, sister of the murder victim, wrote on Instagram: ""You're a murderer, murderer, murderer!"" Derya Kaya later said Camilleri deserved to spend the rest of his life in jail. One of the Kaya family's lawyers said the guilty plea would at least spare the family the pain of having to travel to Malta for court hearings.  ""Nothing will take the pain away. This will not bring their  daughter back. But at least they will not have to fly to Malta for court hearings and reopen that wound each time,"" Shazoo Ghaznavi told reporters outside court.  Camilleri, 34, was arrested in Gżira on the morning of January 18, shortly after he mowed down Kaya and smashed his BMW into a fuel station and KFC restaurant just after 2am. The horrific crash was captured by the fuel station's CCTV cameras. Kaya was walking home from a friend’s house. It was her 30th birthday. Eyewitnesses described seeing Camilleri emerge from the wrecked vehicle, pick up stones and fling them at his victim, who was lying on the ground, and assault a passer-by. He resisted arrest when police showed up and had to be tasered to be subdued.   Camilleri later told the police that he “wanted to be famous” and that he was “a psychopath and proud”.  Blood tests showed that he was drunk and high on cocaine at the time of the crime. Officers also found cocaine in his vehicle.  Attorney General lawyers Nathaniel Falzon and Kaylie Bonnett prosecuted, together with inspectors Kurt Zahra and Shamus Woods.

What does an astrophysicist in Malta do?,Times of Malta,"While astrophysicists are often linked with high-tech laboratories and sophisticated tools, a considerable amount of work happens behind the scenes at their desks. In today's data-centric landscape, where the amount of captured information is staggering and precision requirements are paramount, the days of relying solely on manual techniques are behind us. To navigate this new era, we find ourselves immersed in the development of sophisticated algorithms to automate, analyse and correct vast datasets, enabling us to push the boundaries of our understanding. Astrophysicists depend highly on imagery to glimpse into deep space. A picture of the night sky tells us a lot about the Universe’s history because it acts as a snapshot of the past. Everything we see has travelled light years to reach us, resulting in their positions in the sky appearing as they looked a long time ago. It's like looking back in time and seeing the story of how stars and galaxies formed and changed over the years. So, each object in the picture is like a little piece of history that helps us understand the larger story of the Universe. While traditional telescopes help us zoom in on objects we see in the sky, Earth's atmosphere can distort and blur the light coming from space, affecting the quality of observations. This is why we place telescopes in space, to avoid this distortion. Yet, our ambition to develop better telescopes relies on optical modelling. By creating virtual models of telescopes and their optical systems, scientists can predict how light will interact with the telescope and its instruments - One of the main areas of focus for optical modelling and simulation in space telescopes is the development of image processing and correction algorithms. These algorithms are used to remove artefacts from telescope images, such as those caused by the telescope's optics or the digitisation process when capturing and storing the images on the telescope’s onboard camera, to produce more accurate images. Optical modelling and simulation are also used to develop new imaging techniques for space telescopes. These techniques can be used to image objects that are too faint to be seen using traditional methods. Such techniques have been used to develop the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. These telescopes have produced some of the most iconic images of the Universe. Adding to such important work, Dr Ian Fenech Conti is a computational astrophysicist at Malta’s Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy (ISSA) at the University of Malta. His research has contributed to the recent first images emerging from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid space telescope.   Fenech Conti developed cutting-edge algorithms that are used for the optical modelling of the Euclid telescope in collaboration with Professor Lance Miller, from the University of Oxford and Professor Kristian Zarb Adami from ISSA. His work was incorporated into the telescope, which revealed razor-sharp astronomical images in colour across such a large patch of the sky that had never been seen before. An astrophysicist’s work is never over. As telescopes become more sophisticated, the need for accurate and efficient modelling and simulation tools will only increase. Investing in an extensive computing processing farm is not economically viable, and consequently, a crucial aspect of the process involves fine-tuning these algorithms for swift and efficient execution. This can be achieved through various techniques, one of which is shifting data processing data onto the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), a process that is being led by Professor Alessio Magro from the Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy. Such advancements are not solely for the benefit of out-of-this-world research. Techniques developed in astrophysics find practical applications in our everyday lives. One such example is project OPTICA, spearheaded by Fenech Conti himself and Andrea DeMarco, where similar optical modelling techniques are being used to enhance the clarity of astrophotography images captured by smartphones.

Malta's free bus service has cost €32 million in subsidies so far,Daniel Ellul,"The government has spent nearly €32 million on subsidising Malta’s public bus trips since they became free for all residents a year and a half ago. Since October 2022, anyone with a valid Tallinja bus card can travel on the busses for free, with the government footing the bill with Malta Public Transport (MPT), a private operator.   The government pays MPT the fares that a passenger would have otherwise paid themselves, a spokesperson for the transport ministry said.  “To give an example, if a person who is a holder of a concession card makes five trips during a month, the government reimburses the bus operator for five trips at the concessionary fare rate,” the spokesperson said.   On average, the government has paid MPT €2 million a month through the measure, with the figure going up slightly since the scheme began in the autumn of 2022.  RELATED STORIES  The amount paid varies each month depending on usage, the spokesperson said. Figures detailing what the government paid MPT each month were tabled in parliament last week after PN MP Charles Azzopardi asked transport minister Chris Bonnet a parliamentary question.

‘Our time is running out’: Palestinian student in Malta,Fiona Galea Debono,"A Palestinian student in Malta, who is crowdfunding to get her family out of Gaza, feels she is “running out of time” as she claims their home was targeted by missiles and “burned down like it never existed before”. Nour Zaqout said her father and uncles, who had stayed behind, had only left a couple of days before the house was hit a week ago. “I was calling them tirelessly to get them to leave. They refused but thankfully they left in the end,” Zaqout said. The 27-year-old says she has felt helpless and frustrated ever since she left Palestine to pursue her scholarship studies in Malta shortly before the Israeli bombing started in retaliation to the Hamas attacks on October 7. “They left to live in tents,” she said, about her family’s desperate situation in a crowded and unsanitary camp, with no access to clean water, food, medicine, or electricity. “But now, they have evacuated the tents too because these are also being targeted. There is no safe place, and they just keep on fleeing,” Zaqout said. “I am running out of time, and instead of just observing from the outside, I want to help my family out. I want them to at least be safe. “The neighbourhood I live in was targeted with white phosphorus, missiles and rockets,” she wrote on her crowdfunding page, updating donors as she attempts to raise money to help her family evacuate and cross into Egypt.   Zaqout claims it is an “open secret” that hefty fees of up to €9,000 a person – and rising – were requested at Rafah, the only border crossing. She has raised more than €22,000 out of the €64,000 she needs to get her family across the border through her gofundme campaign: ‘Escaping Genocide: Gaza Evacuation for My Family’. The student, who insists she would have stayed at home had she known what was in store only two weeks after she left, said members of her family remain unsafe in the south of the Gaza Strip. “The situation is getting worse and more dangerous, the bombing is heavy, and a vast number of massacres are taking place everywhere, especially in the ‘safe’ south.” Zaqout is informed military planes are everywhere, and “they shoot literally anything that is moving”.   She was last in touch with her family two weeks ago due to a complete blackout of telecommunications and internet, she said. “They are living under constant fear and violence for the past few months. They have been forced to flee from one place to another, seeking shelter in tents, schools, hospitals, or anywhere they can find. “They are exposed to the cold and rain, and to the constant threat of more attacks. I am afraid they will be hit as many tents were targeted and run over by tanks and bulldozers.” The last time they had to flee was when they were staying near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, one of the few functioning health facilities in the Gaza Strip, Zaqout said.   The area was among the hardest hit in Gaza – the Israeli military has stormed and besieged hospitals, preventing patients and medical staff from getting in and out. “They barely escaped with their lives, but they lost everything we had. They joined thousands of other displaced people, who had nowhere to go.” Among them is Zaqout’s cousin, Lama, who is due to give birth to her second baby by C-section. But the hospitals are overcrowded, understaffed and ill-equipped, and patients are being treated without anaesthesia, electricity, or water, she said. “Many women have died or lost their babies due to the lack of proper care and the constant fear and stress,” she said. “Lama, like many others, is terrified and in pain. She does not know when or where she will give birth, or if she and her baby will survive. She has no access to pre-natal care, ultrasounds, or any other medical service. She has no safe place as the bombs and rockets can hit any building at any time.” Zaqout continued to appeal to the world from her home in Malta “to hear our voice, to see our suffering, to feel our pain, to stop this madness, to end this conflict”.

Farmer hurt in fireworks blast claims breach of rights and damages,Matthew Xuereb,"A farmer who was buried under rubble in a fireworks factory blast close to his Kirkop field is seeking damages from the authorities and the factory licensee, claiming none of them have acted to protect his rights. Eugenio Bugeja was tending to his chickens and rabbits when a series of explosions rocked the San Ġużepp fireworks factory on November 26, 2022. The blasts killed Leonard Camilleri, 64, a fireworks enthusiast who had been the factory’s licensee for several years.  A piece of metal was lodged in Bugeja’s skin and he was left waist-deep in rubble when a border wall between his field and factory collapsed in the blast. Despite the incident, the Planning Authority granted the St Joseph Kirkop Band Club permission in July last year “to reconstruct dangerous structures blighted by [a] fireworks factory explosion [that] occurred on-site”.   Bugeja appealed that decision, invoking Article 80 of the Development Planning Act, which allows anyone to ask for the revocation of a permit in cases of fraud, the submission of false information, an error, or where public safety is concerned. In a judicial protest filed in court, Bugeja has now accused the fireworks factory of applying for the permit “in bad faith” since the demolished structures that it was seeking to replace were not in place before 1994 as laid down in the law. He argued that some of the structures that were destroyed or partially destroyed in the blast were illegal as they were built after 1994 and without a permit. Under Maltese law, fireworks factory structures built before 1994 do not need a planning permit. Bugeja claims that the Planning Authority refused to process his application for revocation, coming up with all kinds of excuses. Despite being filed in July last year, it was still pending before the PA.  In the meantime, he said that despite evidence of clear illegalities on site, the Building and Construction Authority never found anything illegal when called. He argued that the authorities were breaching his rights, as guaranteed by the Constitution of Malta, because he was being deprived of remedies as required by law. He warned them of further action in this regard. The judicial protest was filed against Prime Minister Robert Abela, Minister for Public Works Chris Bonnet, State Advocate Chris Soler, Planning Authority chairman Emanuel Camilleri, BCA CEO Jesmond Muscat, and Simon Attard and licensee Paul Abdilla in representation of the San Ġużepp fireworks factory. Bugeja is asking the court to declare a violation of his fundamental rights and award compensation for damages he was suffering. Bugeja had unsuccessfully asked the courts for an injunction to stop reconstruction, but despite acknowledging the element of danger, Judge Anthony Ellul decided against him because the fireworks factory had a valid planning permit.

Fact-check: Is the hospitals' inquiry facing ‘exaggerated delays’?,Neville Borg,"Claim: Pending for more than four years, the Vitals inquiry is facing “exaggerated delays”. Verdict: While most magisterial inquiries are completed in less than four years, around 20% take longer than that to be concluded. The magistrate leading the Vitals inquiry concluded 41 inquiries last year, more than several of her fellow magistrates. Prime Minister Robert Abela lambasted the “exaggerated delays” into a magisterial inquiry investigating potential money laundering and corruption by his predecessor Joseph Muscat and a number of his then-ministers, in scathing comments made last week. Abela was responding to questions about Muscat’s potential candidature for this year’s European Parliament elections. “This inquiry has been pending for four and a half years. A magisterial inquiry should be completed within 60 days according to the law, but this has been pending for four years and three months,” Abela said. “Many people are wondering how this inquiry has been delayed so much when it had all the tools at its disposal, unlimited financial resources, unlimited access to foreign financial experts.”   Abela’s comments refer to a magisterial inquiry launched in November 2019. In his comments, Abela conspiratorially suggested that the completion of the inquiry is being timed to inflict maximum damage on the Labour Party’s electoral prospects. Yes, at least on paper. According to Malta’s Criminal Code, which sets out the terms under which magisterial inquiries are carried out, a magistrate needs to complete their work within 60 days. Once this period elapses, the magistrate must send the Attorney General a report explaining the reasons behind the delay. A fresh report, each time explaining why the inquiry hasn’t been completed, has to be sent every subsequent month.   In reality, things are often a little different. In 2018, then-Attorney General Peter Grech testified that these reports are “unfortunately not submitted regularly”, saying that most inquiries take longer than the 60-day limit set by the law. Almost all of them, to put it bluntly. Most recent court statistics show that there are currently 1,695 pending inquiries being handled by magistrates in Malta and Gozo’s courts, as of December 2023. Over the previous two months – or roughly 60 days – some 119 inquiries were completed and an almost equal number of new inquiries, 116, were opened. This effectively suggests that of the 1,695 pending inquiries, the vast majority (over 1,550) have gone beyond the 60-day threshold set by the law. There's no publicly available data showing when each pending inquiry was launched, so we don’t really know how long each inquiry tends to take from start to finish. But a reply by Justice Minister Jonathan Attard to a parliamentary question last April gives us a glimpse into this.   Attard revealed that of the almost 1,700 magisterial inquiries that were pending at the time, only 186 had been opened in 2023, with the remaining 1,512 dating back to previous years. Most of them, 1,178, had been launched in the previous four years, between 2019 and 2022. The remaining 334 had been launched in 2018 or earlier, meaning that they had been in the works for more than four full years. A handful of them appear to have all but ground to a halt, having been launched decades ago. One inquiry dates back to 1979, two others to the late 1980s and a further three to the early 1990s.  This effectively means that around one in every five magisterial inquiries takes more than four full years to be completed. This doesn’t come as a surprise. Last year’s EU Justice Scoreboard found that it takes courts almost four years to resolve administrative cases, the lengthiest wait in Europe, amidst a raft of other shortcomings in the judicial system. That’s impossible to tell without knowing the complexities of each inquiry. Magisterial inquiries deal with a wide range of issues, from traffic accidents to murders and financial crimes, so they tend to vary wildly in nature. But we can get a good idea of how many inquiries magistrates are concluding each month by looking at court data. Over the past year, magistrates concluded a total of 765 magisterial inquiries, or roughly 64 each month. But, just to complicate matters, they were also handed an almost equal number of new inquiries each month, meaning that their workload has remained more or less the same. In total, the number of pending inquiries dipped ever so slightly throughout 2023, going from 1,741 at the start of the year to 1,695 by the end of it.   The Vitals inquiry, which is currently in the eye of the storm, is being led by magistrate Gabriella Vella. Muscat is calling for Vella to be removed from the inquiry, arguing that comments made by her father and brother on social media have prejudiced the case and breached his rights. He has also repeatedly questioned leaks emerging from the inquiry, saying that this casts a shadow on its integrity.   Court data shows that, aside from the Vitals inquiry, Vella currently has 137 other inquiries on her plate, together with 99 other ongoing court cases. Over the past year, Vella concluded some 41 inquiries, roughly at a rate of three and a half each month. This compares quite favourably with her fellow colleagues on the bench. On average, magistrates tended to conclude somewhere around 31 inquiries throughout the year, roughly ten fewer than Vella did. But there are some caveats which need to be taken into account. Some magistrates tend to deal with more inquiries than others, so the number may be skewed in their favour. Aside from that, the lineup of magistrates changed slightly throughout the year, with the number of magistrates leading the inquiry rising from 23 in January to 24 in December. While the law says that magisterial inquiries should be completed within 60 days, they seldom are. Figures suggest that most inquiries are completed in less than four years, but a fairly significant number – roughly 20% – tend to take longer than that. The number of pending magisterial inquiries dipped slightly over the past year but still stands at almost 1,700. This includes a handful of inquiries that were first launched over three decades ago. Magistrate Gabriella Vella concluded 41 inquiries throughout 2023, more than most of her other fellow magistrates.

‘I fell for a scam. Now I’m being charged with money laundering’,Neville Borg,"A man has seen his life turned upside down after he fell for an online scam, which saw him not only losing hundreds of euros, but also have his accounts frozen and face money-laundering charges. The 35-year-old man has spoken up to alert the growing number of potential victims who are falling for the elaborate traps set by scammers and to urge them to file police reports if they are to avoid his current predicament. Chris* was not aware what was going on when he received the notice summoning him to the police’s financial crimes department. That morning, he woke up and left the home that he shared with his family to head to work, as he had done countless times before. Nothing could have prepared him for the fact that he would be spending that night in a prison cell. When he showed up at FCID, he was arrested on the spot, charged with money laundering, and handling stolen money. The charges dated back to an incident some months earlier when Chris had replied to a lucrative job offer on Facebook. The advert, for a company called Global Stable Growth, promised easy money through online crypto trading, a quick way for Chris to top up his salary. Although he had a steady job, money was tight, and he was finding it difficult to make ends meet. The opportunity seemed too good to miss. He enquired about the job, speaking to a representative of the company named ‘Vicky’ on Facebook Messenger. She eventually directed him to the company’s senior account manager, a man called ‘James Donald’, who contacted him through WhatsApp using a UK phone number. In a series of WhatsApp chats, seen by Times of Malta, Donald explained how the job worked.   Chris would be working as an online trader, investing money through a crypto exchange such as Binance and earning income through his investments. In addition to investing his own money, Global Stable Growth, his new employer, would also send him some additional funds to help him invest. Chris was cautious at first, aware of how scammers tend to prey on people for a quick buck. But when Donald sent him €100 to get started, Chris was convinced that the job was real. If they were going to rob him, they would not be sending him money, he told himself. Chris threw himself into the job wholeheartedly, watching his crypto earnings grow from one week to the next. Donald helped him along, sending him money from time to time to keep him going. In total, Chris received some €6,000 to his Revolut account over several weeks, which he would then deposit through Binance and transfer onwards to other accounts. Then came the catch. If he wanted to withdraw his earnings and keep going, he would need to invest more and more money. By the time he realised that the job was a scam, he was €900 out of pocket, having spent hundreds to try to recover his losses. Whenever Chris pleaded for help in getting his money back, Donald grew increasingly hostile. Chris eventually decided to cut his losses, blocking Donald’s number and get on with his life. With little hope of reclaiming the €900 he lost, he thought there was no point taking things further, better to just forget about the whole incident. That decision would soon come back to haunt him.   Chris’s lawyer told Times of Malta that he is not the only local victim of this scam, with a Maltese woman having lost €70,000 through the same scam. After she filed a police report, hoping to catch the perpetrators and recover her funds, police traced some of her bank transfers to Chris’s Revolut account. His lawyer says that of the €70,000 she lost, most went to foreign bank accounts, and only €7,000 went to Chris. The scammers, he says, were effectively using Chris and people like him as middlemen, receiving money directly from other victims who have been ensnared and converting it to crypto which they would then send on to the scammers.   Police, however, see things differently, and say he played an active part in the scheme. Chris was charged with laundering the full €70,000, despite most of that stolen money having gone to other people, his lawyer says.  Chris vehemently denies any involvement. He insists he is a victim, unwittingly caught in a complex web woven by the scammers. He now faces a minimum fine of €20,000 if found guilty, almost three times the amount that effectively ended up in his account through the scam in the first place. Chris rues the day that he failed to report the scam to the police. He says that the police told him that if he had, he would not have been considered a suspect and would have likely never been charged. His lawyer eventually did file a police report about the scam after he was charged but little has come of it. But Chris would be far from the first scam victim who did not report to the police. A 2016 study by a group of Maltese criminologists found that only 81 per cent of victims of computer crime reported the crime to the police. This is likely to be even higher today, with online scams becoming pervasive. This is most likely because “victims might tend to feel stupid for having fallen victim to this type of crime”, the study’s authors say, so victims are often embarrassed to own up to having been duped.   Several international studies estimate reporting figures to be just as low. British police believe that only 13 per cent of scam victims ultimately report crimes to the police. Meanwhile, a European Commission study found that only about a fifth of those who experienced fraud reported it to an official authority. Most of the people who did not report, the study found, did so either because they felt the money they lost did not cause too much financial or emotional harm, or because they were not convinced that reporting would actually make a difference. This comes as little consolation to Chris, who says that the ongoing court case has turned his life upside down and taken a huge emotional and financial toll. A freezing order on his bank account left him virtually penniless and dependent on his family for financial support. A second arrest, this time for breaching his bail conditions, followed months later. But Chris hopes that the worst is behind him and that his story will help others in a similar predicament to evade the traps set by scammers and to report scams that they come across. *Name has been changed to protect his identity.

Sarah Bonnici to represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest,Giulia Magri,"Sarah Bonnici won the Malta Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday evening and will be representing Malta at the annual festival in Malmö, Sweden in May.  Bonnici performed the song Loop, obtaining a total of 102 points, beating out Matt Blxck's Banana, which got 80 points. Ryan Hili placed third in the contest with his song Karma, garnering 71 points overall.    Bonnici brought energy, fun, and dance moves to the Eurovision stage. The 25-year-old Gozitan singer started her journey back in 2009 when she first participated in the finals of the Malta Junior Eurovision Song Contest and placed third.  She also participated in last year's competition with the song Heaven.  Voting was split between a professional jury panel and nationwide televoting.    Bonnici's performance won over the judges who awarded her the highest scores with a total of 79 points.  But Matt Black emerged as an audience favourite, with the highest share of televoting votes, 29, going to him. Blxck briefly held a one-point lead above Bonnici, where he topped the list momentarily with 80 points.  However, Bonnici's strong lead with judges' votes pushed her into a comfortable lead with an additional 23 points from the audience vote, securing her the win.  Ryan Hili, a former X-Factor Malta winner remained steady in third place, getting 51 points from the judges and 17 votes from televoting.     Saturday’s finale was different compared to previous years, as the final was not a live performance but a live-on-tape performance streamed to audiences.   RELATED STORIES  Instead of performing in front of cheering fans and an eager audience, the artists' pre-recorded performances were aired at the TVM studios in Guardamangia. The singers provided their interpretations of their songs.  But viewers taking to social media weren't shy about expressing their displeasure that the local competition had deviated so drastically from its usual form. Many said that they flat out did not enjoy the new format, particularly the fact that the singers were not performing to a live audience.  “With all due respect to all the performers, but I don’t think that they deserved this after all the work they put into it, to have a final like this,” one woman said.  “This is not a festival but a joke and without an audience it just sucks.”  One man felt that this year’s edition of the festival was hell-bent on ensuring Malta placed “dead last” in the European competition, based on Saturday’s show.  Another woman concurred that the lack of an audience took something away from the show.  “In my opinion, the emptiness of the audience was felt, especially by the singers,” she said.  “The sum of a song isn’t just a music video but also how it translates live with an audience. At the Eurovision, there will be thousands of people watching you.”   The competition also failed to run smoothly for Denise, who hours before the show aired, took to social media to tell her fans she had been battling bronchitis.  She said she lost “full control” of her voice and vocal range, which has had a severe impact on her performance.  “I have even seriously considered withdrawing out of Eurovision Song Contest completely, till a few hours ago,” she wrote.  “I have battled many emotions and doubted myself in more ways than one. However, although it wasn’t an easy decision to take after so many efforts, for many months this is what Mara stands for.” She said due to the illness, the performance will not reflect her artistry but will reflect her perseverance and the meaning of the song.

Activists form 'mass grave' in Għadira in protest of 'genocide' in Gaza,Times of Malta,"Activists from two civil society groups on Saturday reiterated their calls for Malta to join an international court case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza and to close its airspace and sea to warships or planes. The call was made by activists from Moviment Graffitti and Youth for Palestine during a symbolic protest event organised at Għadira Bay, Mellieħa.   Activists accused Israel of perpetuating a “full blown genocide” in Gaza, with the blessing of its allies including the United States and various European countries. It noted that over 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the current war began on October 7, almost all Gazans displaced and the area subjected to a blockade that stops food, clean water, medicine and essential aid from entering the Gaza strip. Israel has bombed schools, churches, refugee camps and hospitals, they noted.   The NGOs said they were not surprised by Israel’s extreme reaction, given its “long-standing project to expel Palestinians from their land and to keep those who manage to remain under harsh oppression.” While Malta made various declarations of solidarity with Palestine, it had so far failed to call for a permanent ceasefire within international institutions and stopped short of describing Israeli aggression as genocide, they said.   They therefore called on the government to join South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice against Israel and to push for European sanctions against Israel for as long as it ignored ICJ rulings.  RELATED STORIES  At least one local politician, Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba, has said he would like Malta to join that ICJ case. The ICJ last week ruled that Israel had to allow urgent humanitarian aid into Gaza and prevent genocidal acts. Israel, which is a signatory to the UN Charter and therefore legally obliged to respect ICJ rulings, said it would not comply.   Aside from backing South Africa’s legal push, activists are also pushing the government to close Malta’s airspace and sea to weapons of war and to make it clear at EU and global level that it backs the Palestinian cause.

Four schools in three years: is Malta's inclusive education system broken?,Claudia Calleja,"The parents of an autistic and non-verbal teenager have spoken up about the lack of inclusion after their son was forced to change school four times in three years. Emma and Julian McEwen believe the education system has not catered for the needs of many neurodiverse people like their 15-year-old son, Finn – especially once they move to senior school. Times of Malta spoke to the parents of another three autistic children who were forced to leave their school or attend less frequently, once they grew older. The parents did not wish to be named. Their stories shed light on the lack of resources and training across schools. The Commission for the Rights of Persons with Disability said it got involved “in cases where parents were told to keep their children at home from such schools either totally or reduced school days”. The commission spoke about the need for more learning support educators (LSEs) and more training for educators, among other things. Anne-Marie Callus, an associate professor at the University of Malta’s Department of Disability Studies, said that such stories showed that “it’s high time to have another evaluation of the way inclusive education is working – or not working – in Malta”. Finn was diagnosed with autism when he was two-and-a-half. He is non-verbal, with cognitive delay, sensory processing disorder and requires a high level of support. “We were bringing up a child who had autism and we were able to live our lives as a relatively normal family. He was young, so there was not a huge gulf of a difference with other kids,” they say. But things changed as he progressed through school.   “Schools naturally adapt their structure for older children, for example, classes and tutoring become more structured, sports become more challenging etc. Schools, however, do not do enough to adapt to the needs of children like Finn. His behaviour and mental health deteriorated because of unmet needs – the lack of inclusion in education, the lack of social inclusion, the lack of appropriate education programmes,” they say. Behaviours of unmet needs have manifested in open-hand slapping, banging his head against tables, doors, glass and walls, loud vocalisations and slumping onto someone’s lap. All these actions communicate: “You don’t understand me”, “you treat me as less”, “I cannot cope any more”, his parents explain. But now it is no longer a little child slapping, banging or slumping. It is a growing teenager. Julian elaborates. What the education system lacks is awareness about the cause of such behaviour and the skills to address those causes. “When you feel stressed or anxious and need to take yourself to a quiet spot, you can go for a coffee or a walk; some people unconsciously twirl their hair in their fingers or drum their fingers on the desk. This is self-regulation,” explains Julian. So, when children with autism are overwhelmed by, for example, loud sounds – which can include construction noises or a teacher yelling (as had happened to Finn) – their anxiety levels soar. They cannot communicate their anxiety and they cannot take themselves out of the downward spiral. They cannot self-regulate. “Put this together with not being able to speak and you’ve got a mini personal hell,” Julian says, adding this leads to the “challenging behaviour”. “This behaviour is their ‘wheelchair’ – their visible sign they need us, as a society, to adapt. Providing a ramp for a wheelchair is a no-brainer. Providing a room for anyone to get calm in should be, too, but it isn’t,” says Julian as he speaks about the need for all schools to have calm rooms where neurodiverse and neurotypical children can be taken to self-regulate, to calm themselves. Finn was “asked to leave” the private school he had been attending all his life in the last year of junior school, after the school board asked the parents to put him on medication. After that he went to a government middle school where he received better support, followed by a secondary school but, again because of poor facilities in later years, he had to leave. He is now at a resource centre where the parents believe he is still not being given the right support. Discussions with the centre are underway to find a solution. “Finn is very resilient. He will surprise you. What we want is academic and emotional support as needed by each individual to access education and inclusion. We want policies to change. We want equality,” they say. Marco Bonnici, who heads the Malta Union of Teachers, says it is unfair that, when there are difficulties, fingers are pointed at LSEs and educators. “We are seeing an ongoing wave of unjustified criticism from some parents towards the work of LSEs and other educators when dealing with disability issues… LSEs and educators do their utmost to support students during the entire education journey but blaming them for situations beyond their control is unfair,” he says, adding that “resources are never enough, especially human resources”. One LSE, who works in a government school, believes that LSEs are trained to handle children with disabilities but lack the resources and specialised training to deal with specific conditions.   Another LSE who works in a private school says: “I feel that not all teachers have the same inclusive attitude towards students with disabilities... The reality in independent schools may be different from that in State schools. Collaboration with parents is expected and this helps everyone to work together towards common goals of students.” Questions sent to the education authorities remained unanswered at the time of writing.

Asphalt plants should be regulated by ERA – ombudsman,Claudia Calleja,"Malta’s 11 asphalt plants should be regulated by the environment authorities, according to the ombudsman, who looked into the matter after Iklin residents complained about “toxic fumes” emitted from a tarmac factory for years. In a final opinion, the ombudsman said that, even though EU directives do not require asphalt plants to be environmentally regulated, this did not imply this should be the way forward in the local context where “everything and everyone is close to each other”. It recommended that the Environment and Resources Authority – which has been claiming it has no power over the matter – draw up regulations for such plants. In October, Times of Malta reported how San Ġwann and Iklin residents raised complaints about a toxic smell of tarmac that infiltrated closed windows at night from the Bitmac asphalt plant in Tal-Balal Road. Swieqi residents have now joined in. One Swieqi resident took footage of the visible particles in the air near the Ibraġ parish church and another resident spoke about the “pungent smell in the air”.   Complaints and calls for action amid concerns over air quality have been made on and off for three years but they have fallen on deaf ears, residents said. They took the matter to the ombudsman where they claimed that, each time the plant produced a batch of asphalt, residents were suffocated by toxic fumes that could damage their health. They said ERA insisted it had no power to investigate or enforce and the superintendent of public health told them it could not act unless it was proven that the plant was leading to serious illness. The commissioner for environment and planning at the ombudsman’s office, Alan Saliba, and health commissioner Ray Galea noted that “tarmac plants should be properly regulated by controlling the type and upkeep of the combustion equipment, the type and quality of the bitumen used and the period of operation of the plan with respect to weather conditions”. They welcomed ERA’s initiative to increase monitoring stations and carry out long-term monitoring.   Swieqi mayor Noel Muscat said that, some weeks ago, he smelt the stench and thought there were roadworks in the area. He then realised it was the factory.  He said some residents even complained of black particles in their pools. The council was collaborating with the Iklin council and they were actively working on trying to address the situation. Iklin mayor Dorian Sciberras said: “I hope that the government takes concrete steps for a practicable solution that protects the health and safety of the residents – residents have a right to live and enjoy their property.” Questions sent to Bitmac in October, and resent yesterday, remained unanswered. According to the Bitmac website, the installation of a new Benninghoven asphalt plant in 2018 allowed the company to increase its capacity to produce up to 350 tons of hot asphalt per hour.

‘Cannabis’ cruise reported to police,James Cummings,"An illegal cannabis-themed cruise has been reported to the police by Malta’s cannabis authority. The ‘420 Friendly Sunset Boat Cruise’, advertised on the website of local cruise site Visit Blue Lagoon Malta, was reported to the police by the Association for the Responsible Use of Cannabis (ARUC) yesterday. For €55, passengers are promised cannabis, bottled water and fruit salad and the “opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals”. The website describes the ‘trip’ as “friendly and laid back, with music, good vibes  and, of course, plenty of cannabis to be shared”. According to the law, however, cannabis may only be purchased from licensed associations while smoking in public and sharing cannabis are both banned. In a statement, ARUC executive chairperson Leonid McKay said the authority “condemns these money-driven opportunists negatively impacting the reform”. New rules on cannabis were introduced in late 2021 allowing for limited recreational use of the drug. He went on to warn “that trafficking cannabis... still carries very serious criminal consequences” and that the authority had reported the event to the police.  “The ARUC distances itself from any profit-driven businesses promising the sale of cannabis or a ‘cannabis friendly space’. These businesses do not fall within the scope of the reform... and have received no training on harm and risk reduction,” he said.  McKay added that the authority was committed to implementing cannabis reform “in the interest of public health and safety of the community” and appealed to the public to “to be wary of false online promises, and/or businesses”.   When contacted, a spokesperson for Visit Blue Lagoon Malta defended the company’s actions, however, saying it only advertised cruises and that, for more information, the operator should be contacted directly. When asked for details of the company offering the cruise, the spokesperson refused, instead advising contacting the operator by making a booking enquiry through the website. Times of Malta attempted to contact the cruise operator yesterday morning but had not received a response by the time of writing. “We’re just an advertising company,” the spokesperson said, stressing the cruise operator was free to offer cruises “as long as they’re not breaking the law”. Describing the event as “more of a workshop where they explain the health benefits – and downsides – of smoking cannabis”, including teaching people how to roll joints, he said that, to his knowledge, the cruise operators were only selling cannabis containing CBD or HHC. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis. While oils and other products containing it are legally allowed to be sold, CBD flower is not. Hexahydrocannabinol, or HHC, meanwhile, despite being psychoactive is not a controlled substance in Malta. Earlier this year, the ARUC expressed “great concern” at its sale. When asked directly if Visit Blue Lagoon Malta had been informed as to what was being provided to ticket holders, the spokesperson said the company wasn’t provided with details about the type of cannabis. Responding to McKay’s words about the company promoting a “cannabis friendly space”, the spokesperson replied “I can’t explain everything” but stressed  that the ultimate responsibility lay with the cruise operator. “If they’re offering a boat tour with a 420 space, to us it’s just a boat tour,” he said, adding the same operator had offered cannabis-themed cruises last year and Visit Blue Lagoon Malta had received no complaints about the event. The number 420 is a reference to an annual international day celebrating cannabis use, which falls on April 20, expressed in American date format as 4/20. While the advertised cruises are only available to those aged 18 and over ‒ the legal age at which one can join a cannabis association and consume the substance ‒ it is in breach of several rules governing the drug’s use. According to regulations, cannabis should only be consumed at home, with those doing so in public liable to appear before a justice commissioner and fined up to €235. Sharing or gifting cannabis is also prohibited.  RELATED STORIES  In December, pressure group Releaf Malta called for the repeal of the law governing the sharing of cannabis, calling it “outdated and stigmatising”. The group described it as facilitating the arrest and prosecution of law-abiding citizens. The advertised cruises may also fall foul of laws prohibiting advertising, though this is not immediately clear; while the law states that cannabis associations may not advertise their services, it does not specifically prohibit other businesses from doing so.  The new law allowing for legal cannabis consumption has not been without its critics, with both the opposition and drug rehabilitation organisations such as Caritas arguing it will normalise drug abuse.

"Marsascala must remain a residential locality, says ADPD",Times of Malta,"Marsascala risks being engulfed by plans to develop two large supermarkets and a hotel in the area, the Green Party said on Saturday as it presented its candidate to run for a local council seat in this year’s elections. Brian Decelis will represent the ADPD on Marsascala ballot sheets in the June elections, with the candidate pledging to ensure a “fair balance between business and the needs and wishes of residents”. He argued that Marsascala is primarily a residential locality and must keep its character. Decelis was joined at a press conference by ADPD deputy chairperson Carmel Cacopardo, who said local councils needed to speak out louder to stop unrelenting development that is destroying the social fabric of local towns and villages. Cacopardo used Marsascala as a case in point, noting that the Planning Authority is currently faced with two applications to build supermarkets in the area, as well as a proposal to build a hotel – as well as plans to turn the former Jerma Palace Hotel into blocks of apartments. Aside from generating traffic, the two supermarkets would also deal a blow to small and medium-sized shops in the town, Cacopardo said. ADPD had already made its opposition to the supermarket plans clear in a statement earlier this week.  Plans to develop a hotel made little sense, he added, given that a carrying capacity study published in 2022 revealed that Malta would need to more than double its yearly tourists to fill all the hotel beds available or being planned. “This is yet another case in point where the Planning Authority is failing in its duty to regulate land use wisely, since it is expected that we will far exceed the hospitality facilities than the country actually needs, eventually resulting in shutdowns and bankruptcies,” Cacopardo said. Decelis emphasised the importance of Marsascala remaining a residential town and not being overly commercialised.   “The needs of its residents must remain paramount, rather than the needs of property speculators,” he said. “Areas which are hardly disturbed, such as at the sites where the two supermarkets and the hotel have been applied for, are to be safeguarded.” Decelis said other residential issues that need to be given importance include the encroachment of tables and chairs on pavements and excessively loud music in certain areas late into the night.

"Animal welfare is being neglected and promises left unfulfilled, PN says",Times of Malta,"Multiple promises to improve animal welfare standards have been left to languish, the Nationalist Party noted on Saturday. PN animal welfare spokesperson Janice Chetcuti noted that an animal hospital in Ta’ Qali has been closed since last August, that a pledge to create a re-homing centre for stray animals remained unfulfilled and that a government promise to set up an animal cemetery never materialised. “It’s becoming clearer and clearer that the sector is crying out for more investment,” Chetcuti said in a statement on Saturday. The PN MP was reacting to news that the animal commissioner is investigating how animal welfare officers handled a dog that had been shot. In video posted to social media, the dog was seen with a rope tied around its neck and with the hoop of a catch pole around its stomach, as two officers carried it into an animal ambulance. Chetcuti said animal carers and handlers at the animal welfare department require continuous training about how to handle animals and said they are sometimes not given the equipment they need to do their job properly and humanely.

‘I moved to Malta for the wrestling’,Daniel Ellul,"As professional wrestling grows in popularity, Daniel Ellul steps into the ring with some of the most terrifying personas. Laura Krasuckaite always wanted to become a professional wrestler but there were no opportunities for her dream in Lithuania, so she moved to Malta. “In Lithuania, or any nearby countries, we don’t have professional wrestling, so I had to find a country that had it,” said the 25-year-old. “I moved to Malta purely for wrestling.” After training for seven months, she will make her debut tonight under the alias ‘Loraleen’ as one of the wrestlers taking part in Pro Wrestling Malta’s Carnival Clash event at Monte Kristo. In the garage of a Safi field with an inbuilt wrestling ring, Times of Malta spoke to the wrestlers as they prepared for the event.   PWM, founded by Wayne Pace, or ‘The Maltese Warrior Gianni De La Valette’, held its first show in 2015. It now has 13 professional wrestlers who perform for the public in a show every three months. They are coy about pay levels, saying it depends on experience but most balance wrestling with other jobs. According to Germain Zammit, who has been with the academy from the start, an average of 250 spectators attend each show, with 300 tickets already sold for tonight’s performance. Zammit, who performs as ‘Jack Quinn’, says the sport can sometimes be misunderstood.   Those who think professional wrestling is “fake” should “come train for a day” and reveals that most people who do  find it so difficult they don’t return. “It’s very tough on our bodies. The slams are real, there’s no way around that, and we get injured,” he said. “It’s harder than MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) because we are not trying to hurt each other but we have to make it look like we are.” He says that the company often hosts wrestlers from across the world including from the US and Japan. Because all wrestlers use the same techniques, there is no need to choreograph anything before they step into the ring, meaning most of the fights are improvised. The wrestlers must all come up with their own characters and storylines: Zammit’s alter ego is a magician who uses his magical abilities in the ring. He said crowd interaction is crucial in making a show as entertaining as possible. “You have to be good at acting as well if you want to make people invested,” Zammit, who is also an assistant trainer, said.   Tonight, Maltese professional wrestling will see a royal rumble, a type of match where wrestlers throw each other over the top rope of the wrestling ring until one wrestler remains. The PWM championship title will also be up for grabs, with reigning champion ‘Adam Envy’ (Sean Caruana) defending the championship belt against Japanese wrestler Shigeriho Irie. Describing his wrestling persona, the 27-year-old said that Adam Envy is somewhat of a villain. “Adam Envy is your flamboyant viral obsession; he’s out there. He loves life but hates everyone at the same time.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Malta needs a second national hospital, health minister says",Times of Malta,"Malta needs a second national hospital to keep up with its growing population, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela has said. Abela believes the Gwardamangia area that includes St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals is ideally placed to serve that function, as part of a broader “health village”. St Luke’s Hospital is mostly closed and in a dilapidated state, while Karin Grech serves as a rehabilitation hospital. Both facilities were taken back by the government after a court annulled contracts with Steward Health Care, which was meant to revamp them as part of a privatisation deal. The minister’s idea – which he acknowledged is still at an embryonic stage and will need to be refined – is to shift all non-clinical services, including the medical school, away from Mater Dei Hospital and to the Gwardamangia “health village”. That would allow “every nook and cranny of Mater Dei to be used for clinical purposes,” he said. Apart from maximising the clinical floor area at Mater Dei, the minister said he is also keen to enlarge the hospital ""where the concrete allows us to"".  Concrete used to build parts of the hospital was of inferior quality, reducing its load-bearing capacity.   Developing such infrastructure would take years, and Abela acknowledged that he would not be the minister to see it to fruition.   ""We politicians are focused on short-term goals, but it's important that those goals align with our longer-term vision for the country,"" he said. ""We need to ensure the country is prepared for what it needs 20, 30 years down the line."" Abela said he did not exclude the possibility of another private firm being brought in to beef up front-end emergency medical services, though he made it clear that if this happened, public healthcare would remain free to access. “Just as we use private sector services to slash hospital waiting lists, we could do the same to bolster emergency services,” Abela told radio show host Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103. “The emergency room needs to expand,” he said. “Our healthcare infrastructure needs to expand.”   But the minister also emphasised that the challenge is not just of a lack of infrastructure or physical space, but also of human resources. Most of Europe has had to contend with a shortage of healthcare workers for several years, and Malta is no exception. He cited the example of radiographers, who are in short supply, and said that it made no sense for the University of Malta to restrict its annual intake of students to just 15. While Malta currently relies on importing healthcare workers from poorer countries, such as India and the Philippines, the minister believes the existing steady stream of workers will reduce to a trickle when working conditions in their home countries improve. When asked about his plans to expand mental health services, Abela noted that work to renovate the existing facility, Mount Carmel Hospital in Attard, was in full swing and confirmed long-promised plans to shift acute mental health care to the Mater Dei area. The minister said his preference was for such care to be provided directly within Mater Dei, though he said he was also open to it being done in an area close to the state hospital. Abela’s predecessor as minister, Chris Fearne, had presented parliament with a plan to develop such a facility in Swatar, connected to Mater Dei via an underground pedestrian tunnel. “I’ve seen those plans, but where possible, and where the concrete can take it, I would rather focus on expanding Mater Dei,” Abela said on Saturday. Correction February 3, 2024: A previous version stated that St Luke's Hospital is closed. Parts of it are still operational as outpatient departments.

Watch: 'This is why us farmers are protesting',Times of Malta,"Updated 1pm with MHRA statement Michael Caruana has faced many challenges in his years of growing and exporting potatoes, but few have been as daunting as the prospect of being undercut by producers outside the EU.  Caruana first came to national attention over a decade ago, when a video interview he gave about his dedication to agriculture went viral. He has spent the ensuing years growing his potato business into a thriving one, and was one of many farmers who took to Malta's streets on Friday to join Europe-wide protests against EU rules they say are punishing them while helping non-EU farmers.   The EU has signed several free trade deals in the past years, effectively removing trade barriers for various non-EU products from countries such as Mexico, Vietnam and Ukraine. It has also introduced stricter regulations for European farmers, banning things like the use of antibiotics on livestock or the use of GMO crops.  European farmers say the result is that their costs are up and farm production is down, while farmers in countries without such strict rules are being given free access to European consumers.   Like the local farmers' association, Caruana thinks that is unfair.  ""Europe spent years getting to where it's at and banning dangerous chemicals. But agricultural products grown outside the EU can use those chemicals, and then be sold in Europe. We don't agree with that,"" he said as he drove his tractor to Floriana on Friday.    Caruana said that his presence during Friday's protest was intended to signal to authorities that farmers' livelihoods need protecting - for their own sake and that of their children. He now hopes his young daughter, who is still an infant, will eventually follow in his footsteps and enter the business.  ""Some people are surprised when I tell them that, because she's a girl. But she's got hands and a head like everyone else. I will encourage her to continue this work,"" he said.   RELATED STORIES  Friday's protest was led by Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi. On Saturday, Koperattivi Malta said it strongly endorsed the event and called for more inclusive dialogue with farmers. ""Koperattivi Malta should be at the table alongside all other social partners. Cooperative societies are an integral part of the socio-political ecosystem, and neglecting or omitting them from policy discussions disrupts this delicate balance,"" stated Daniel Schembri, CEO at Koperattivi Malta. Friends of the Earth Malta also offered farmers its solidarity. It warned policymakers to not use the protests as a pretence for smashing legislation aimed at ensuring sustainable practices. “The anger of many farmers is legitimate. But after years of it being ignored by political leaders, it is now dangerously being exploited by populist parties and agro-industrial lobbies trying to shatter green objectives and commitments,” the NGO said. The protest was also endorsed by the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association, which called on the government and Maltese MEPs to advocate on local farmers' behalf at EU level.  ""MHRA encourages active engagement at EU levels to champion local farmers' interests and implement policies supporting a sustainable and flourishing agricultural sector,"" it said in a statement on Saturday.

Malta votes for its Eurovision Song Contest entry tonight,Giulia Magri,"Malta will vote for its 2024 Eurovision Song Contest entry on Saturday night, as the 12 finalists battle it out on TV screens to be named the winner.  Organisers have whittled down the 36 initial participants to the remaining 12 following a writing boot camp and four semi-finals. The finalists will perform on TVM starting at 9pm.  Unlike previous years, the final will not be a live performance but a live-on-tape performance that will be streamed to audiences.  Many of the artists said they were surprised by the news that they would not be performing in front of cheering fans and an eager audience.  Instead, their pre-recorded performance will be aired at the TVM studios, in Guardamangia. The singer will have an opportunity to provide their interpretation of the song. Once all the performances are aired, televoting and a jury will decide the winner. The televoting will be open for around 20 minutes. During the final, the winner of the best music video will also be announced.  The final will be presented by Carlo Borg Bonaci, Angie Laus and Jamie Cardona.  Malta was represented by indie pop group The Busker at the festival in Liverpool last year. The Busker performed their song Dance (Our Own Party) but failed to make it to the final. The Saturday night show will also offer a lucky viewer the chance to experience the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest final in Sweden first-hand. To participate in the competition, viewers must take a photo with family and friends while watching the Malta Eurovision Song Contest final and upload it in the comments section of the competition post uploaded on TVM’s social media pages later on Saturday evening.  The winner will get a trip for two to Malmö, Sweden, where the contest will be held in May. The winner will be announced on Magic Malta radio on Monday.

From the Bench: Reckless litigation or justified pursuit of justice?,| Celine Cuschieri Debono,"The right to access the courts is a right which is sacrosanct in any democratic jurisdiction, including Malta. While a party may lose a lawsuit, the law still protects the legitimate claim to seek and institute that lawsuit. In other words, in filing or responding to a lawsuit and then failing to have a successful outcome, one would not necessarily be breaking any laws or abusing of any rights. One would simply be exercising his or her right to seek the legal remedy he or she requires. However, the question that arises: where does one draw the line? What is justified on the one hand and what is frivolous and vexatious on the other? The Court of Appeal was faced with this question on January 18, 2024 in the case Edward Pavia vs Dr Joseph Ellis pro et noe (to represent the heirs of Edmea Pace). The case went back to September 19, 1987, when Pace (now deceased) signed a promise of sale and obliged herself to transfer a property in |Gzira to Pavia (the appellant) by title of exchange. Pavia was bound, on the other hand, to transfer to Pace a property in St Paul’s Bay and pay her Lm2,000. The promise of sale was to expire in three months. The parties did not see eye to eye and matters culminated in judicial proceedings filed by Pavia calling for Pace to appear on the final deed. Simultaneously, Pace filed proceedings to declare the promise of sale null and void. The two proceedings were both decided in Pavia’s favour meaning that Pace was bound to sign the final deed. Pace appealed both judgments but both of her appeals were declared to be deserted by the Court of Appeal. This drove Pace to file fresh proceedings for the declaration of nullity of the promise of sale and nullity of the judgment. The Civil Court, First Hall, decided that the matter had already been decided and upheld the plea of res judicata. Pace appealed this judgment and following a decision on November 3, 2006, the acts were sent back to the Civil Court, First Hall for the court to evaluate evidence on the plea of res judicata. In the meantime, Pace passed away and no one accepted her inheritance. Once again, the proceedings were declared to be deserted, this time by the Civil Court, First Hall. Because so much time had passed from the original favourable judgments, Pavia had to institute proceedings to be able to execute his executive title, i.e. finally publish the final deed. The final deed was published on the 20th of May 2011. In the latest court action, Pavia deemed Pace’s behaviour, particularly through the institution of several proceedings to be abusive, illegal, capricious, and reckless. As a result, he claimed to have suffered substantial damages. He therefore asked the court (at first instance) to declare this and for Pace’s heirs to compensate him for such damages. Curators representing Pace’s unknown heirs replied by saying that they were not well aware of the facts at hand and reserved the right to present further pleas later on. The Civil Court, First Hall, did not agree with Pavia that Pace’s behaviour was abusive, illegal, capricious, and reckless and deemed it to be a mere exercise of her rights at law. Pavia appealed. He claimed that the First Court had interpreted the facts incorrectly and that, consequently, damages of €33,649.60 as well as €72,000 (to compensate for lack of use of the premises) had to be liquidated in his favour. He argued that he was deprived of the use of the premises (the property Pace had to transfer to him) for 24 years (from 1987 to 2011). The curators on behalf of Pace’s unknown heirs replied by pleading prescription in terms of Article 2153 of the Civil Code. There was however an issue with the plea of prescription. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the curators had requested the court at the end of their appeal reply to confirm the first judgment in its entirety. But how could the first judgment be confirmed in its entirety if the plea of prescription changed things? The Court of Appeal deemed this to be contraditory and thus regarded the plea of prescription to be forfeited. What the curators had to do, the court explained, was to ask for an amendment of the judgment which in turn had to be done via cross-appeal. There then remained the issue of whether Pace’s actions were indeed reckless and abusive of the judicial system. The Court of Appeal explained that the right to seek the court’s protection was among the most important rights, in the exercise of which the citizen should not be disturbed. It was up to the same citizen, however, not to abuse of such rights and become liable to damages. Having said this, just because a person lost a lawsuit, did not mean that he or she abused the system. It is only in exceptional circumstances that this was the case. The Court of Appeal referred to previous judgments on the matter and explained that to prove reckless litigation (and thus have a successful claim for damages), one has to show that such person either was fully aware of the frivolous nature of his or her claim or that such awareness could be acquired with better diligence. Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court of Appeal concluded that Pavia was clutching at straws. The court agreed that Pace was persistent in her claim that the promise of sale be declared null and void, and one could not deny that Pavia won the case that he filed against her to execute the same promise of sale. Furthermore, one could not deny that Pace’s appeal had been declared deserted. It was true that she kept presenting application after application in spite of the appeal being deserted. It was also true that she proceeded with filing yet another case.However, the Court of Appeal explained, this did not mean that she abused of the judicial system. The court held that Pavia failed to prove any bad faith on Pace’s part. Furthermore Pavia could have enforced the judgment he obtained back in 1993 much before. It is to be noted that Pace’s first appeal was declared deserted on December 26, 1994 and her second appeal on February 14, 1994. The court held that there was nothing legally stopping Pavia from enforcing the favourable judgment at that point. The court acknowledged that this could be because he was trying to reach an amicable settlement with her, but still, it was his decision not to enforce at the time. For these reasons, Pavia’s appeal was rejected and the first judgment was confirmed. This means that Pace’s actions were not found to constitute reckless litigation.

Ian Borg meets Ukraine's Zelensky in his first foreign trip as OSCE chair,Times of Malta,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked Malta for having hosted a peace meeting last October while hosting Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg in Kyiv. Borg was in the Ukrainian capital on behalf of the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe, which Malta is currently chairing. It was the first time that the two met.   In a brief statement on X, Zelensky said the October peace talks had elevated the discussion to a “new, high level”. He urged Malta to direct the OSCE’s efforts towards returning unlawfully deported Ukrainian children to their families. The October peace talks involved representatives of 66 countries and international organisations, though Russia and China were not among them. Malta assumed the chair of the OSCE, the world’s largest regional security body, after the previous candidate, Estonia, dropped out following opposition by Russia. The trip to Kyiv was Borg’s first foreign trip as OSCE chair. Apart from meeting with the Ukrainian president, Borg also visited the Ukrainian villages of Borodyanka, Bucha and Gostomel, which have been battered by war following Russia’s invasion. He also met with Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba, to discuss in further detail Ukrainian priorities for the OSCE.   Accompanied by Ambassador Marcel Peško, Special Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine, Borg was also given a presentation of the work that the OSCE officials are doing in Ukraine. ""This first visit as Chairperson-in-Office emphasises our determined commitment that, as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and also as Malta, the Ukrainian cause remains a priority on the international agenda,"" Borg said.

How foreign workers are driving Maltese industries,Neville Borg,"Maltese workers are moving away from construction, manufacturing and retail jobs in favour of white-collar professions or office jobs, with foreign workers stepping in to fill in the gaps, data tabled in parliament suggests. Replying to a series of parliamentary questions last week, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana tabled employment data breaking down the number of foreign workers across the different sectors of Malta’s labour market. The data shows, perhaps for the first time, how Malta's workforce is changing and the extent to which foreign workers have been driving economic growth across several industries. There are roughly as many Maltese and Gozitans in the labour market today as there were five years ago, with the overall number only rising marginally from 197,000 in 2019 to 203,000 in 2023. However, the number of them working in sectors often associated with manual labour, such as manufacturing, vehicle repair and construction, appears to be on a downward trend. The number of Maltese working in tourism also appears to have dipped, with Maltese workers in the accommodation and catering sector dropping by 15% since 2019. On the other hand, the number of Maltese workers in professional and administrative roles has ballooned in recent years. Maltese nationals working in jobs classified as professional, scientific or technical have shot up from 12,700 to 15,300 in the past five years. These include professions such as lawyers, architects, accountants and translators, amongst others. Likewise, there are now also more Maltese workers in administrative positions and, notably, in public administration, compared to five years ago. This doesn't mean that the industries being abandoned by Maltese workers are dying. On the contrary, foreign workers appear to be stepping in to vacate the gaps left by the Maltese workers across several of these industries, with non-Maltese workers now making up some 35% of the total workforce.  The number of foreign workers in construction has shot up by over 70%, going from a little over 6,100 in 2019 to over 10,500 five years later. Meanwhile, those working in retail or vehicle repairs have almost doubled, from 5,600 to 10,300 during the same period. There are also 15,200 foreign workers in accommodation or catering today, 4,000 more than there were in 2019. In total, the number of foreign workers has multiplied from just under 70,000 in 2019 to over 107,000 last year. This figure stood at just 18,700 a decade ago, meaning it has ballooned by almost 500% since 2013.  This data reflects comments in a recent IMF report which observed that there “has been a tendency for foreign workers (especially those from non-EU countries) to flow into low-productivity sectors (such as accommodation and construction)”, simultaneously pushing Maltese workers towards higher paying jobs and keeping wages low.   The data also sheds light on the provenance of foreign workers, showing how an influx of third-country nationals in recent years is sustaining Malta’s economy. The number of EU nationals working in Malta has dipped slightly between 2019 and 2023, dropping by some 700 people to 34,900. This dip is mostly driven by Brexit, meaning that the 5,100 British nationals working in Malta are no longer classed amongst this group. The number of third-country nationals working in Malta, on the other hand, has almost tripled, rising from 25,600 in 2019 to 68,700 five years later.   The sharpest rise was amongst Southern Asian workers. The number of workers from India rose by almost 10,000 since 2019, now reaching just over 13,000, making them the largest non-Maltese group in Malta’s labour market. Likewise, Nepalese workers increased from 1,700 in 2019 to just over 8,000 last year. Workers from several other Southern Asian countries, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan also increased, albeit to a lesser extent. Looking further east, the number of workers from the Philippines doubled since 2019, now reaching 9,500 while, on the other side of the globe, Colombian workers shot up from just 226 to a little over 3,100 in the past five years. Closer to home, Albanian and Turkish workers have also become increasingly active in Malta’s workforce, with the former now becoming one of the most widely represented nationalities, with 3,400 workers. EU nationals, on the other hand, have remained fairly stable in numbers over the past years, with workers of most nationalities increasing slightly over the past five years. Our closest neighbours Italy tops the list of EU nationals, with over 11,500 Italians currently in Malta’s workforce.  The data also reveals how third-country nationals are far more likely than their European counterparts to be working in the construction industry. Over four out of every five foreign workers in the industry are from outside the EU. In fact, more than one out of every 10 third-country nationals work in construction, double the ratio of their EU counterparts. Workers from some countries are particularly likely to be involved in construction. Of Malta’s 3,400 Albanian workers, some 1,500 (or 43%) are involved in the construction sector. Likewise, just under half of the almost 2,800 Turkish workers and three-quarters of the 480 Syrian workers in Malta are in the industry. Over the past year, the government has pledged to limit the number of non-EU nationals in Malta, hoping to curb abuse and exploitation by introducing measures to prevent businesses from focusing solely on importing workers and moving to licence temping agencies. It is too early to know whether these measures have had any impact as yet, but the figures show early signs of a possible slowdown in the number of foreign workers moving to Malta. The first seven months of 2023 saw an influx of 9,000 foreign workers, a 12% drop over the same period the previous year. This is particularly evident in some sectors, such as construction and administration, where the increase of foreign workers has been less pronounced than in most previous years.

Economy expands at faster pace in third quarter - CBM,Press Release,"The Maltese economy expanded at a faster pace in the third quarter of 2023 when compared to the previous quarter, according to the Central Bank of Malta.  Exports were the main contributor to economic growth, while domestic demand had a marginally positive impact.  The CBM’s estimate of the output gap indicates that the degree of over-utilisation of the economy’s productive capacity increased marginally compared with the previous quarter. Consumer price pressures eased further, but inflation remained high from a historical perspective and above the European Central Bank’s inflation aim. The bank’s Business Conditions Index remained above its historical average and the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator rose further above its long-term average.  Developments in the labour market remained positive. The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio and the debt-to-GDP ratio fell when compared with the second quarter of 2023. While Malta’s debt ratio was lower than the euro area average, its deficit ratio was close to the euro area average.  Whereas Malta’s GDP rose compared to the same quarter a year earlier, that in the euro area contracted marginally. Employment growth in Malta was also faster than the euro average while the unemployment rate was lower. However, HICP inflation was higher as energy inflation stood negative in the euro area, whereas in Malta it remained unchanged.  In light of persistent inflationary pressures, the ECB raised its key interest rates in July and September. No further increases were announced by the end of the year.

Watch: Malta farmers join European protests over policies threatening livelihood,Matthew Xuereb,"Updated 12.20pm Maltese farmers gathered on Friday to protest for the first time in 40 years.  Farmers met in Ta' Qali with their tractors, to begin a trip to Floriana. They say existing and new EU policies will threaten their livelihoods. It is the first protest by Malta's farming sector since 1982 and follows similar protests in other EU countries in recent weeks. Angry farmers have protested in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.   The local farmers will drive 12km through Attard, Mosta, Lija, Birkirkara, Msida, Pieta and Floriana protesting the EU’s current framework and future ambitions that are ""seriously threatening the livelihoods of farmers"". Several attached protest banners to their vehicles reading, among others: ""No farmer, eat synthetic"", ""EU kills its own farmers"" and ""Green deal? No deal"".   Pauline Pisani told Times of Malta that unless Maltese farmers stood up for their rights, no one will. ""Have you heard any politicians in Malta and in the EU saying anything in our defence? Only we know what we're going through,"" she said. Another farmer, Karmenu Vassallo added: ""We're here because we're fed up with working for nothing. Our costs have increased but we're forgotten. Without us, there will be no food on the table"".   It is being organised by the Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi with the support of stakeholders in the agricultural sector. On Thursday the PN claimed the government was trying to discourage farmers from attending the protest. Reacting, the government said the Opposition was spreading lies, noting that the farmers' planned demonstration would be protesting the European parliament and institutions that are ""cut off from reality"".    Farmers are unhappy with EU policies. Photo: Matthew Xuereb. Slide for more photos    1. EU trade deals that remove or reduce trade barriers for agricultural products from non-EU countries with laxer regulations. EU farmers say they cannot compete.    2.  EU state aid rules that forbid governments from financially helping farmers for things like damage compensation or increased expenses.    3.  EU rules that reward farmers for leaving fields fallow, to encourage soil fertility. Farmers say this incentivises landowners to keep land unproductive.   4.   EU rules intended to make farming more environmentally friendly but which farmers say are being introduced too quickly and without the necessary support to ensure farm production is not impacted. They cite EU policies such as the Green Deal, Biodiversity Strategy, the Regulation on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products, the Nature Restoration Law, the new provisions in the Common Agricultural Policy and other legislative proposals.  ""Such aggressive, quick and ambitious changes within these legislative frameworks will have detrimental effects on the food landscape in Malta and Europe, in general, since they would significantly affect the tools (such as chemicals and land available) used by farmers to produce food,"" Għaqda Bdiewa Attivi said.  ""Hence the provisions of these environmental legislations should be achieved once ensuring that economical alternatives to these affected tools exist and that all measures are in place for the impact on farmers to be mitigated.""

Judge to personally check on Keith Schembri's phone in court evidence room,Edwina Brincat,"A judge has upheld a request by Keith Schembri’s lawyers to conduct a visit to the court’s exhibits office on Friday afternoon to document whether the phone at the centre of an ongoing saga was as a court expert had left it.  This was the outcome of an early morning hearing in proceedings where Schembri’s lawyers are claiming the phone had gone ‘missing’ for months after being presented in evidence in proceedings where he stands accused of money laundering and other financial crimes.  They are claiming that Schembri’s rights were breached through the court’s failure to safeguard the phone which is a crucial piece of evidence, casting doubt as to whether it could have been tampered with.  While those constitutional proceedings continue, the Criminal Court presiding over Yorgen Fenech’s murder case ordered the same expert to produce a copy of data extracted from Schembri’s phone in that case, as requested by Fenech’s lawyers.  But that order triggered a reaction by Schembri’s lawyers who flagged the matter to Mr Justice Mark Simiana, presiding over the constitutional case. Judge Simiana issued a ban, declaring that Schembri’s phone was not to be touched by anyone until further directions by the court and scheduled an urgent hearing for Friday, summoning court expert lawyer Martin Bajada, for further clarification on the issue.  Bajada’s testimony shed some light on the matter. He explained that when the iPhone and other electronic equipment were originally handed to him by the police who had seized them during searches targeting Schembri, he had placed all devices - except for a bulky desktop - in a Lidl box.  Each device was inside an evidence bag, duly numbered, and the box was then wrapped in sealing tape. But when he returned to the exhibits room to carry out the brief given to him by the Criminal Court, presided over by Madam Justice Edwina Grima, he found the exhibits in different circumstances. The desktop and box were placed together in a recycling bag.  Noticing the difference, Bajada did not touch anything and informed the exhibits officer.  He then went to the registrar of the Criminal Courts and asked him to go back to the evidence room together.  He informed the Criminal Court, emphasising that “he saw nothing irregular” at that stage, but “only for transparency’s sake” sought authorisation to photograph the exhibits before carrying out the assigned task. But Bajada did not even get that far.  The minute he was notified about the ban issued by Judge Simiana, he stopped there, awaiting further instructions from the courts.  Asked by Schembri’s lawyers, Bajada said that he had only assessed the situation “visually”, confirming that he had made out the desktop and box through the semi-transparent recycling bag. But he could not tell what was inside.  However, according to normal practice, when any exhibits are handed in at the court's exhibit room, they are duly photographed. Bajada also clarified that with regards to Schembri’s phone, all data extracted from it had been preserved in four different magisterial inquiries.  The requests by four different inquiring magistrates were all fully documented and Bajada himself had done all the copies.  Asked specifically about the phone, Bajada replied, “I was not allowed to continue the exercise. So at this stage, I can only speculate. Once I carry out the exercise [set by the Criminal Court] I can tell.” That exercise was to prepare another copy of the phone data.  Asked by AG lawyer Maurizio Cordina whether he confirmed that the phone was presented in July in Schembri’s money laundering case, Bajada said that he could only confirm the date on his report. “My report states otherwise,” he said, adding that he could only confirm through receipts and other documents in the case file which he did not personally have access to. Following Bajada’s testimony, lawyer Edward Gatt requested the court to order an on-site visit so that the bag and “Lidl box” could be opened in the presence of the judge to resolve this issue before the case could continue on the merits.  Lawyers representing the AG and the police commissioner did not object as long as the visit was carried out as soon as possible so as not to disrupt court proceedings.  The court upheld the request after calling back the expert to check his availability and scheduled the visit for Friday at 3pm.  Only the parties’ lawyers, Court Registrar Franklin Calleja and the judge were to attend together with the court expert to examine the exhibits at issue.  The case continues.  Lawyers Carina Bugeja Testa and Maurizio Cordina assisted the AG and Police Commissioner who was represented by Superintendent Ann Marie Xuereb.  Lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo are assisting Schembri.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Maltese theatre project collects €3,000 for Palestinian children",Giulia Magri,"One November morning, Youssef was hungry and his mother decided to make his favourite dish- fried tomatoes. As she was about to rush out to go search for two tomatoes to calm her son’s hunger, Youssef’s mother told him to close the door carefully and wait until she returned. Minutes later, there was no door or home to return to as Israeli missiles bombed the street, leaving many homeless, injured and dead under the rubble. Her beautiful Youssef, with his curly hair and white skin, was killed. He was seven years old. Youssef is one of the thousands of Palestinian children who died due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise wave of terror attacks into Israeli territory, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel. The attack provoked retaliation from Israel, which has left a humanitarian catastrophe and a horrific death toll on children in Palestine, especially in Gaza. According to health officials in Gaza, over 25,000 Palestinians - many of them women and children - have been killed since October 7. Many other children have been left injured, homeless and suffering from trauma. Youssef’s story was one of the heartbreaking narratives a group of Maltese actors performed earlier this month to raise funds to support Palestinian children dealing with the trauma of war. The Gaza Monologues performed at Spazju Kreattiv earlier this month is an international project based on the personal stories of children living in Gaza. The monologues read out during the performances were written by children and youths in 2010, 2014 and also more recently stories during the current conflict in Gaza.   The show was produced by Toni Attard and directed by Jean-Marc Cafà. While tickets were free, donations were collected for Al-Harah Theatre, which provides psycho-social activities for children in the West Bank trying to process their trauma. In the past few weeks, the production managed to raise €3,575 for the Al-Harah Theatre and will be sending the donations in the coming days. “The feedback we received from the production has been exceptional and the conversation it generated is very important,” Attard told Times of Malta. “I believe that theatre has a role to play as a platform for uncomfortable conversations and can also be a place of solidarity, where we come together and do something to help.” The Gaza Monologues is not the only local production that puts the spotlight on the conflict. My Name is Rachel Corrie is a play based on the true story of a 23-year-old activist who was killed in Gaza in 2003 while protecting Palestinian homes from demolition. The one-woman show had its opening night on January 25 at The Splendid, in Strait Street, Valletta, and will run till February 4. Produced by WhatsTheirNames Theatre, the play is directed by Philip Leone-Ganado and stars Sandie von Brockdorff in the title role. “I first encountered the play in 2009, during the war on Gaza that Israel called Operation Cast Lead and it’s been on my mind ever since,” Leone-Ganado told Times of Malta. “What we are witnessing now is orders of magnitude more devastating and if there were ever a time to hear stories like these, it’s now.”   Leone-Ganado, who was one also of the actors in The Gaza Monologues, said staging the play in Malta now was an opportunity to bring a different and more human perspective to the news of the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict. “Theatre has a responsibility to respond to the most pressing issues of the day,” he said. “Theatre cannot change the world but it can allow us to come together to see, think and feel differently. Someone once said we sit together in the dark to know how to love each other in the light and plays like this present a deeply human perspective that is often missing from news reports.” He said a portion of all proceeds will be donated to the Palestinian Red Cross Society and they are also collecting donations after each production. “This play reminds us of the human beings behind the numbers as well as the role the world at large, and each individual in it, plays in enabling or opposing what is happening,” Leone-Ganado said. “Rachel went to Rafah to stop the tanks and paid for it with her life. That’s something worth reflecting on.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

When replying to questions by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Gozo and planning ministry specified that Marica Borg, Ellul and Tabone were chosen by the minister in terms of a provision in the Development Planning Act that specifies that these so-called “independent members” are persons  “of known integrity” and with knowledge of and experience in commerce, economy and industry, cultural heritage, matters relating to environment,  development, social and community affairs, sustainable development and urban planning or architecture and infrastructure. Borg is a lawyer by profession. She is actively involved in the Fondazzjoni Belt Victoria and Il-Ħaġar – Heart of Gozo Museum, the first cultural centre of its kind in Gozo. Borg is also involved in the day-to-day running and executive decisions of the museum. Ellul, an architect and civil engineer, is the husband of the former controversial chair of the PA commission responsible for ODZ permits, Elizabeth Ellul. He served as president of the Chamber of Architects. Tabone is qualified in construction engineering and obtained a postgraduate degree in architecture with a focus on conservation. Hili and Mario Borg were appointed by the ministry as public officers representing the government and who have experience or qualifications in matters such as planning, the environment, infrastructure, economic affairs, agriculture, tourism and transport. Hili is a project leader at the Gozo ministry currently responsible for the upcoming Gozo Museum. He also serves on the board of directors of Heritage Malta and previously served on the board of the Maltese National Commission for UNESCO and the Arts Council Malta. He had also managed the restoration of the Cittadella Cultural Centre. Mario Borg is an economist and worked for several years at the Economic Policy Department as a senior economic analyst, as a Director of Economic and Business Statistics at the National Statistics Office and as an economic consultant at MIMCOL. He currently serves as the chief executive officer at the Gozo Regional Development Authority. The new board will meet today to decide on several applications, including the new Institute for Tourism Studies campus planned for SmartCity, in Kalkara, which has already been approved but which had part of the permit marked as a reserved matter.

Robert Abela welcomes revised EU budget including €50 billion Ukraine aid deal,Times of Malta,"Robert Abela on Thursday welcomed the revised mid-term European budget that includes €50 billion of aid for Ukraine, in a move the bloc hailed as a strong message to Russia. The Prime Minister said the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, which was greenlighted by all 27 member states, will  help south European countries continue investing in socio-economic and sustainable development.  Funds had also been allocated to address the main drivers of migration, in a bid to reduce the influx in the region, he said. In his first comments following the summit, the Prime Minister urged for a two state solution in the Middle East, calling for a permanent ceasefire and immediate humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza.  On Thursday the EU overcame months of opposition from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban to agree to the aid for Ukraine. The deal to keep funds flowing to Ukraine came as doubts over support from Kyiv's Western backers buoyed Russian President Vladimir Putin, nearly two years into his invasion of the neighbouring country. In an abrupt about-face at the start of the gathering, Orban agreed to drop his veto on the four-year package for Kyiv in the face of intense pressure from the EU's other 26 leaders.  The Hungarian nationalist appeared to come away largely empty-handed - securing only the promise of a possible review on the spending in two years.   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the deal in a video address to the EU leaders as ""a clear signal that Ukraine will withstand and that Europe will withstand"".  ""The message is clear,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron after the Brussels summit wrapped up. ""Russia cannot count on any fatigue from Europeans in their support for Ukraine."" Macron said the deal likewise sent a message to Washington - where billions of dollars in aid are held up in Congress - ""that the European Union is here, committed and delivers"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also voiced hope that the EU decision could assist US President Joe Biden in convincing reluctant Republicans to pass Washington's own $60-billion proposal for support for Ukraine. ""I hope that the message that we're sending out today and the discussions we're having today is helping him,"" Scholz said. Roberta Metsola meanwhile told European leaders the deal gave ""the credibility, legitimacy and predictability"" expected from the bloc. ""Because Ukraine’s security is Europe's security,"" the President of the European Parliament said. She promised Europe will continue to deliver “by listening to the concerns of its citizens, businesses and farmers, by making it easier to invest and to modernise, and by ensuring economic growth that benefits all.” Metsola also referred to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, saying the European Parliament was the first EU institution to call for a permanent cease-fire. “It is a necessary step towards lasting peace and stability - as are the return of all hostages and the need for Gaza to be led by legitimate Palestinian representatives. “A two-state solution can offer security to Israel and a perspective for the Palestinian people.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Government trying to discourage farmers from attending protest - PN,Jessica Arena,"Updated 7pm with government reaction The government is trying to discourage farmers from attending a protest planned for Friday, with organisers backing up claims made public by the Nationalist Party.  News broke on Thursday that farmers plan to take to the streets in protest of EU policies which they say will threaten their livelihoods.  Farming cooperatives and unions have led protests against these policies all over Europe in recent days, particularly in France where protestors have blocked all the major routes into Paris and dumped manure across the French capital. However, as word of the protest began to spread, some farmers reported being called up by officials from the Agriculture Ministry who tried to persuade them not to attend.  PN MEP candidate Peter Agius said on Thursday he was approached by four farmers who told him they were discouraged from participating in the protest.  Protest organisers confirmed with Times of Malta members told them they were being pressured to forgo protesting on Friday.  Agius condemned Agriculture Minister Anton Refalo for trying to intimidate farmers into not protesting instead of listening to their concerns in earnest.  “Instead of discouraging farmers from speaking up, we should be seeing how we can change things to help their work be more appreciated,” he said.  “It is in the interest of all families to have local produce available and not rely solely on imported products.”    In a statement, the PN said the government should shift its focus to being an effective aid to farmers instead of trying to shut them up and prevent them from exercising their fundamental right to protest.  “It is shameful that in light of the problems and difficulties faced by farmers, instead of being a shoulder to lean on, the government is trying to silence them,” Shadow Minister Tony Bezzina said.  “This attitude is unbecoming for the Maltese Government, especially at a time when this sector is threatened by diverse markets, not only from overseas but even outside the European Union.”  The PN, Bezzina continued, is calling for responsible leadership and for the government to strengthen its relationship with this industry instead of creating obstacles for the sector.  Reacting to PN's allegations, the government noted that the farmers' planned demonstration will be protesting the European parliament and institutions that are ""Cut off from reality"". ""On the other hand, the Maltese government has always been close to the sector, with brave reforms such as the one regulating the leasing of fields,"" the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement. The government said the PN was spreading a lie about the ministry.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Australian bungalow sent to Malta in 1920s set to open to public 'within weeks',James Cummings,"A wooden bungalow shipped from Australia to Malta in the 1920s to train future emigrants on Australian building methods is close to being opened to the public following restoration.   The bungalow was one of many sent in ‘kit form’ to all Commonwealth countries, though it is believed to be the only one to have survived.  It was meant to give the Maltese a flavour of life down under and to help them learn how to build using timber should they decide to move to Australia. But over the years the building fell into disrepair until the NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa last year announced a year-long project to return the bungalow to its former glory. On Wednesday, just a few weeks ahead of its opening, Malta's High Commissioner to Australia Mario Farrugia Borg visited the site in Għammieri where works are taking place. “Over time, it [the bungalow] was unfortunately left to deteriorate but it is now thankfully being meticulously restored, ensuring we do not lose such an important artefact of Malta and Australia’s common heritage”, he said.   Constructed of deal, a kind of softwood, with a corrugated iron roof, such bungalows were common in Australia. They were designed to utilise materials found commonly in the country and suit its climate. By June 1929, 137 trainees had passed through the training centre, 39 of whom went to Australia. After several years at the Bugeja Technical Institute (Istituto Tecnico Bugeja) in Ħamrun, the Maltese bungalow was moved to the government's experimental farm in Għammieri where it was used as a lecture room. In early 2002, the Australian branch of the United Nations-linked cultural heritage body ICOMOS made contact with its Maltese counterpart about the bungalow. But it was not until 2018 that Din l-Art Ħelwa confirmed it would be taking over its restoration. The NGO was granted a 20-year guardianship of the site in 2022. But now, with the work drawing to a close, in just a few short weeks it will be reassembled in Ta’ Qali, where it will be used to raise awareness of the country’s links to Australia and pay tribute to the thousands of Maltese who emigrated there. Commenting on the project, Din l-Art Helwa executive president Alex Torpiano, said the physical restoration of the bungalow was only one part of the story. ""The other is to collate and present the story of the emigration of Maltese and Gozitans to Australia, and we are grateful for the offer of assistance of the High Commission of Malta in Australia to bring us into contact with our community over there.” The restoration of the Maltese bungalow is sponsored by the Melita Foundation and is expected to open to the public in a few weeks.

PA approves six villas in Mellieħa Miżieb woodland,Jessica Arena,"The Planning Authority on Thursday approved the building of six villas outside the development zone in Mellieħa, citing previous applications for buildings that were approved in the 1970s as justification for the decision. Located next to a series of caves known as l-Għerien tal-Ħilda, the site is currently occupied by a dilapidated structure that was once known as the Sunshine Tourist Complex. The applicants, CF Developers, which includes Gozitan construction businessman Joseph Portelli as a shareholder, applied to demolish the building and build six residential villas, four swimming pools and a series of rubble walls to replace it. The architect is former BCA chair Maria Schembri Grima. The planning directorate concluded that, as per the Rural Policy and Design Guidelines of 2014, since the buildings on the site are covered by valid planning permission and the new development does not exceed the existing footprint of the building, then the proposal is not objectionable. The permit was issued despite a parliamentary petition by a Mellieħa local councillor calling on authorities to halt the plans to demolish the derelict buildings in the Miżieb woodland and develop villas with pools. The site is currently occupied by an agricultural shed/glasshouse, apartments and a restaurant, which are in disrepair. In his report, the case officer argues that PA policies allow for the rehabilitation and change of use of existing ODZ structures.  “The proposed redevelopment is deemed acceptable from a planning point of view since the redevelopment of an existing disturbed site is in line with the general principles of the Rural Policy and Design Guidance 2014,” the case officer wrote. When the matter was discussed by the PA board on Thursday, new board member Andrew Ellul declared a conflict and withdrew from the meeting. The board heard the case officer explain how a permit had been issued in 1974 for a dwelling and another one in 1991 for a terraced house. The applicant told the board that the footprint on site today was larger than what was being proposed, adding that the design complemented the topography and respected the surroundings. Carmel Cacopardo, on behalf of residents in the area, said that although permits had been issued in the past, the application had to be considered on its own merits and could not ignore current policies. “Policies are there to ensure that rural areas are not exploited by uses that are not legitimate or necessary. That’s the whole argument and in my opinion, this permit should not be granted,” he told the board.   What there is on-site today was a dilapidated structure, not a residence, insisting that the board ought to refuse the permit and order that the land be reinstated to the state it was before it was exploited. At the end of a discussion, the permit was approved with six votes in favour and three against, including that of the NGO representative and the Mellieħa vice mayor.

Teens steal rental vehicle from airport car park,Edwina Brincat,"Two teens who stole a vehicle parked at the Malta International Airport a week ago have been granted bail pending sentencing after admitting to their wrongdoing.  The minors - a 16-year-old from Fgura and a 17-year-old from Xghajra, both Maltese nationals - were arrested after being identified through CCTV footage.  The theft was reported last Thursday between 3pm and 5pm when a Ford Focus model owned by a car hire company went missing.  On Wednesday, one of the teens was recognised when he returned to the airport. Further investigation led to the arrest of the second suspect.  Police also found clothes that allegedly matched those worn by the suspects on the day when the car was stolen, the court was told on Thursday.  The youngsters were jointly charged with aggravated theft, as well as driving without a licence and third-party insurance cover.  The stolen vehicle was subsequently retrieved.  They both registered an admission and their lawyers requested the court to order a pre-sentencing report.  The court upheld that request as well as an additional request for bail against a personal guarantee of €10,000 each. The accused were ordered to sign the bail book twice a week and to abide by a curfew.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Victor George Axiak, ordered a ban on the publication of the minors’ names.  AG lawyer Alessia Schembri, together with inspectors Karl Roberts and Roxanne Tabone prosecuted.  Lawyers Alfred Abela, Rene’ Darmanin and Ludvic Caruana were defence counsel.

'People within PL wanted to sideline me': Joseph Muscat,Sarah Carabott,"Joseph Muscat claimed on Thursday that active members within the Labour Party had tried to sideline him. “There were individuals – not within the leadership – who tried to sideline me. I learnt who are my real friends, but people still loved me. It hurt, but it hurt my family more than anyone else,” he told Karl Bonaci during an interview on F Living.  The former prime minister was fielding questions from the TV station owner about his prospective return to politics. He later clarified with Times of Malta that the people who tried to sideline him were still active within the PL, but refused to identify them. Muscat said these same people were still harming the party: “Whoever doesn’t strive for unity is harming the party"".   It was his first wide-ranging discussion after Labour pundit Manuel Cuschieri urged supporters to call for Muscat's return into politics and stand for the European elections in June.  He told Bonaci he was still mulling the idea while taking into consideration what would “truly” benefit the party, the electorate's support, his professional life and family circumstances. Over recent years he had built his own office and several professional relationships: “I cannot tell the people with whom I built such a relationship, that I’m suddenly returning to politics”. In the meantime, Muscat said, his two daughters were considering furthering their studies abroad, while his father was battling cancer. As an only child, he also needed to care for his aging parents. “It is a very difficult decision… I need to think of the good and bad repercussions on the party and also my family,” he told Bonaci. When Bonaci pressed him further, asking: “more yes than no?” Muscat replied: “I need to take care of my family”. “Together with my family, I lived through the trauma when the police turned up at our house. We face it with a brave face as we are not weak. Others would have probably fallen into depression. I don’t want my family to pay a higher price than it has already paid because of me.” Muscat resigned in January 2020 in the wake of the fallout from the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation, but recently shot back into the national news agenda after he said he was not ruling out standing on the PL ticket for the European Parliament elections in June.  On Thursday, he told Bonaci that media organisations and political opponents often mentioned him because his name “sells”.  He also claimed he did not access Facebook and that it was his assistant who takes care of the content on his social media profile. Muscat referred to his attempt at having the magistrate leading an inquiry into the hospitals' privatisation deal removed from the case. He claimed some wanted to tarnish his reputation and waste two years of his life as he went back and forth to court. The magistrate's inquiry into the deal to privatise three state hospitals was triggered by a request made by rule of law NGO Repubblika.  RELATED STORIES  Police officers raided Muscat's Burmarrad home and seized documents in January 2022 because of the probe. Last year, Muscat publicly declared that he wanted the inquiry reassigned to a different magistrate and kicked off legal efforts to force that to happen, because her family members posted comments on social media. Muscat said he still believed that the private sector should be involved in the health sector. He claimed an attempt at privatising the sector failed because of “vested interests” within the health sector that wanted to retain the status quo. “Someone betrayed someone. It is either a situation where whoever was meant to implement changes didn’t implement them or was not allowed to from someone within the health system.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Judge sticks to recusal in hospitals case, deplores State Advocate's 'tone'",Edwina Brincat,"The judge who abstained from hearing the Opposition’s hospitals case deplored the “inappropriate and rather intimidating tone” adopted by the State Advocate and the government when they urged him to reverse his recusal.  Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti on Wednesday delivered a strongly-worded decree rejecting the State Advocate’s claims that the court had failed to follow the correct legal procedure when abstaining from the case. The Opposition is seeking to get the State Advocate to recover funds swindled out of public coffers in the fraudulent Vitals privatisation deal.  The judge abstained from continuing to hear the case after his partner - lawyer Yanika Bugeja - was appointed to act as curator representing Steward Assets Management Malta on the deed of rescission of ground rent on the lands concerning the public hospitals.  But the following day, the State Advocate challenged that decision, arguing that the judge had not followed proper legal procedure and thus his decision to abstain was not legally valid.  The government and Cabinet, who are seeking to intervene in the Opposition’s case, followed suit.  On Wednesday, Mr Justice Grixti turned down the State Advocate’s request after taking note of the Opposition’s views on the matter.  The court also took note of the government and Cabinet’s arguments since, although their request to intervene was still pending, they too had an interest in the matter.  The judge deplored the “inappropriate and rather intimidating tone” adopted by the State Advocate and “unfortunately” adopted by those parties who were seeking to intervene.  This issue was flagged because it was usually a case of “leading by example” and there was certainly no need for such a “fierce tone” in an application requesting the revocation of a decree, said the judge. Every member of the judiciary was not to face recusal capriciously. But the principles of natural justice called for “absolute transparency” in the judicial process and the judge’s duty was to apply foresight when any reason for recusal cropped up. Not all might necessarily think along those lines particularly when the person was “politically blindfolded”, remarked Grixti.  The judge was to ensure that the court’s independence remained untainted not only throughout the proceedings but also once judgment was delivered, so that no one might point fingers, especially if the matter were to end up before some foreign forum.  He had already accepted to continue to preside over the case after his familial ties to surgeon Charles Grixti were flagged, observed the judge.  That medical professional had been involved in the due diligence exercise concerning Vitals Global Healthcare as the original concessionaire on the privatization deal.  As for his partner’s brief as curator, the judge pointed out that that role did not come to an end once the deed of rescission was published.  The judge concluded that his decision to abstain was in conformity with legal procedure and was to stand.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Aircraft forced to make emergency landing following technical fault,Times of Malta,"Air traffic controllers declared a full emergency on Wednesday evening after an aeroplane with three people on board had to return to Malta following a technical fault.  The aircraft landed safely after half an hour in the air.  Times of Malta understands that the plane developed a hydraulic fault, which can affect an aircraft's landing gear.  The plane, which seems to belong to the Swedish Coast Guard, took off at 6.25pm and was heading for Stockholm but was forced to return soon after it took off. It landed safely, approaching the runway from Marsaxlokk and 6.57pm.  Firefighters were on stand-by and followed the aircraft after it landed. As the plane taxied away from the runway, a fire engine drove alongside it.  ""We would like to thank all first responders and emergency teams who arrived on site immediately for precautionary emergency support,"" Malta International Airport said in a statement.

Roderick Cassar’s lawyers seek to suspend murder proceedings,Edwina Brincat,"Roderick Cassar’s lawyers are seeking to suspend criminal proceedings over the murder of his wife until his constitutional challenge against the recently introduced femicide law is definitively settled.  The unexpected twist on Wednesday saw Cassar’s lawyers informing the judge presiding over his constitutional case that they were filing an application requesting an interim measure. That measure would effectively suspend the criminal proceedings wherein Cassar stands accused of the wilful murder of his estranged wife, Bernice, who was assaulted and shot outside her workplace in November 2022. Cassar is pleading not guilty.  Those murder proceedings at compilation stage before the Magistrates’ Court are currently at a very advanced stage, with the bill of indictment expected in the near future.  The bill of indictment would pave the path to the accused’s trial.  Pending the murder proceedings, Cassar’s lawyers filed a separate case before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction claiming that the recent amendments introducing the concept of femicide as an aggravating factor of wilful homicide, breached the accused’s fundamental rights.  They are arguing that the new law did not only introduce the notion of femicide but also did away with the plea of ‘sudden passion.’ Once the murder qualified as femicide, that mitigating factor was “categorically excluded” even if it was proved that the accused acted under sudden passion or was in a state of mental agitation.  Cassar’s lawyers thus argued that the new law was highly discriminatory, sexist and totally counter productive and breached the accused’s right to a fair hearing.  In their latest application for an interim measure the lawyers argued that the outcome of the constitutional case undoubtedly impacted the outcome of the murder proceedings. For that reason it would be wise at this advanced stage of the criminal process to stay (suspend) those proceedings until the constitutional proceedings ran their full course.  Faced with that information, Madam Justice Anna Felice granted Cassar’s lawyers one week to file their request and to serve notification thereof to the other parties.  Within that week, they were also to indicate whether they had any further evidence to produce in the constitutional case.  Such interim measure, if upheld, would likely delay the issuing of the bill of indictment by the Attorney General.  The case continues.  Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi, Marion Camilleri and Jacob Magri are assisting Cassar.Lawyer Julian Farrugia is representing the State Advocate.Lawyers Marita Pace Dimech, Rodianne Sciberras and Ann Marie Cutajar are appearing on behalf of the victim’s family who intervened in the proceedings.

Bill protecting sexually abused minors makes it through parliament,Daniel Ellul,"Minors profiting off prostitution or those involved in the production of child pornography will no longer be prosecuted if they were themselves sexually abused and forced to commit the crime. Parliament on Wednesday approved changes to the law that will also allow victims and witnesses of sexual offences to provide recorded testimony in criminal cases. When they are asked to give live testimony, this may be done through video conferencing.  In such instances, the definition of a minor hs also been changed to include anyone under the age of 18 instead of 16.  These changes aim to protect victims from re-living traumas, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard told parliament. Parliament unanimously approved the Bill that amends the criminal law following a short debate.  The changes will need the president's signature to become law. The draft changes propose protecting ""victims of sexual offences who are minors including through the non-prosecution or the exemption from punishment of victims who are minors for acts which they were compelled to commit in the context of sexual offences and child prostitution"".  It also looks to ""provide increased protection to vulnerable witnesses when they make declarations to the police or give evidence in court"". The changes follow EU directives dating to 2011.  In 2019, the EU Commission told Malta that legislation relating to sexual abuse and harassment towards children and child pornography needed to be strengthened.

"Mosta residents fume as red road markings, bollards set up in quaint piazza",Jessica Arena,"The Mosta local council has come under fresh fire after residents of a quiet piazzetta in the village core woke up to bright red road markings and reflective bollards.  The area known as Pjazza Brittanja hosts a whitewashed statue of the Virgin Mary and serves as a junction between three narrow streets characterised by traditional Maltese houses with limestone facades.  The new road markings that appeared around the statue this week jarred with the atmosphere and character of the area, according to residents. Thomas De Martino, a resident and PN local council candidate said the new road markings had turned one of the few places in Mosta with traditional Maltese village into a “regional road”. “You don’t have to be a genius to realise that the work is not appropriate and doesn’t match the character of this neighbourhood,” De Martino said.  Moreover, the new traffic management system in the area has caused massive inconvenience to residents.    Residents were quick to chime in on their displeasure with the piazza’s new look, with some comparing the bright neon colours to a garish carnival display.  “Is this where carnival celebrations are being held this year? Asking for a friend,” one woman commented on a Facebook post in a residents' group discussing the issue.  “It’s a real shame, it looks like the red carpet they roll out for newlyweds, there’s never a dull moment in the village,” said another.  One resident who recently purchased a house on that street said it was incredulous that homeowners seeking to work on their homes in the UCA are put through rigorous hoops to respect the character of the area but that the council was allowed to forge ahead with these road markings.  “The permits you need to obtain for small works are numerous, not to mention the waiting time for approval. Given that the area is a UCA, I agree with this, it's fully understandable. But this mess, was it ever approved by the authorities,” she asked. In a statement reacting to the public outcry, the Mosta council implied that the bright road markings are temporary until motorists get used to the new traffic management system.  “For those who are preoccupied with the road markings and plastic bollards in Brittania Square due to the new traffic management system, please rest assured that once this one-way system is tested, this area will also be upgraded similarly to what we have done in Main Street, even with the possibility of having benches,” they said.

Site off Delimara identified for floating solar farm,Press Release,"A site four nautical miles off Delimara has been identified as a possible location for a floating solar farm, Energy Minister announced on Wednesday. She said the site had a potential for the creation of 50 megawatts of clean energy. Dalli was speaking during the launch of a preliminary market consultation on floating solar farms, aimed at assessing the market readiness for nearshore floating solar farms in Maltese territorial waters. The PMC identified an area four nautical miles off the coast of Delimara as the first possible site for the development of grid-connected floating solar technology projects, with a potential capacity of 50 megawatts of renewable energy. Dalli said the government was committed to continue stimulating the required green energy investments to attain Malta’s ambitious decarbonisation and sustainability objectives. “We are providing many support initiatives to encourage families and entrepreneurs to develop more land-based clean energy systems. The share of renewables in our energy mix is increasing every year. ""However, in a small island state, spaces for renewables on land are limited. We believe that the vast opportunities offered by our seas can be an important solution. Floating solar farms in open seas are a nascent technology that will continue to expand in coming years through further research and development. Through this consultation, we are triggering a process that can encourage investors and innovators to place Malta at the forefront of this innovative green technology,” Minister Miriam Dalli said.

Abigail Cutajar, from the Energy Ministry, said that following preliminary discussions with the relevant authorities and stakeholders, the site proposed in the PMC was identified due to its proximity to Enemalta’s electricity infrastructure at Delimara, facilitating a more secure connection to the national grid, with minimal transmission losses. At the same time, the development would not lead to significant adverse visual impacts from nearby coastal areas since solar technologies would be installed at a much lower height than other offshore installations. Ing Cutajar explained that the PMC aimed to solicit proposals from operators for the deployment of floating solar technology projects, including photovoltaic farms, extending up to 12 nautical miles off the coast of Malta and Gozo. Economic operators can submit proposals based on the identified potential location, or any other location deemed feasible for such projects. This process will facilitate the evaluation of investor interest, allowing the government to assess the current market preparedness for such projects and support the ongoing technical studies to proceed with a competitive call for offers. The PMC document and all other relevant information are available online at rews.org.mt/pmc The consultation will be open until April 24, 2024. The ministry is also working on a separate process for investments in offshore renewable energy systems, such as floating wind farms, in Malta’s exclusive economic zone. A draft National Policy for the Deployment of Offshore Renewable Energy was launched for public consultation in 2023. The final policy will be published in the coming months. Concurrently, the government also plans to issue a pre-qualification questionnaire to invite investors to propose offshore renewable energy projects.

Number of shops participating in price stability scheme doubles to 400,Times of Malta,"Over 400 businesses have signed up for the government's scheme that urges importers and retailers to push down the prices of basic food items.  Earlier this month, the government announced that up to 400 basic food items would see their recommended prices lowered by at least 15% in a bid to curb inflation.  RELATED STORIES  By January 18, some 200 shops had signed up to the scheme which is expected to last until the end of the year. On Wednesday - the day before the scheme kicks off - the government said the number of shops has doubled to over 400. The number of products also increased to 450. Consumers can now access the recommended prices here.  In a statement, the government said the agreement with retailers and importers was a historic one.  A Times of Malta exercise however shows that several food items earmarked for price reductions through the scheme are unlikely to see big cuts at the supermarket till, if anything at all. The recommended retail price (RRP) of an item is set by the importer, with shops then choosing to either sell at that price or compete by charging less. Some outlets already sell items cheaper than the reduced recommended retail price. The products include different brands of corned beef, cornflakes, cream crackers, fresh and frozen minced beef and pork, packed fresh and frozen pork chops, frozen raw chicken legs, frozen raw whole chicken, frozen peas, broccoli and spinach, imported black tea bags, instant coffee including decaff, skipjack tuna in vegetable, soya or sunflower oil, standard low fat and reduced salt vegetable spreads, straight cut frozen friable French fries, UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed and whole fat milk in cartons or bottle wheat spaghetti and penne packets of all sizes. Meanwhile, according to a Central Bank economic update, inflation on unprocessed food almost doubled in December. The bank's index through which inflation is measured classifies food as either processed or unprocessed. The latter, which includes meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, shot up to 12.2% in December - up from 6.7% the previous month. Processed food, meanwhile, dropped slightly from 7.3% to 7.1% during the same period. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Three teenagers admit involvement in Mosta garden mugging, granted bail",Edwina Brincat,"Three teenagers have been granted bail after admitting they were involved in a mugging at a public garden outside the Mosta Mcast campus. The trio, a 15-year-old and two 16-year-olds, were all charged on Wednesday before magistrate Charmaine Galea. Prosecuting Inspector Stephen Gulia told court on Wednesday the police were alerted to the aggression at Ġnien L-Għarusa in Mosta on January 24 at around noon.  A 22-year-old student was robbed of his laptop by two of the accused. The victim gave chase, caught up with them and wrestled the laptop out of their hands.  The aggressors punched the student in the face and although he got back his laptop, the muggers fled the scene.  The student filed a police report and was escorted to the health centre where his injuries were certified as grievous because they needed suturing.  Police investigations kicked off and two of the suspects were identified through CCTV footage.  Their faces were not masked. One of the muggers and another teen who acted as a lookout during the aggression were the first to be identified, explained Gulia.  The third suspect was soon identified through other footage and information supplied by his alleged partners in crime.  All three were arraigned on Wednesday afternoon. The first to be arraigned were a 16-year-old unemployed Maltese national and a 15-year-old Syrian student - both from St Paul's Bay. They registered an admission to aggravated theft, grievous bodily harm, causing fear of violence, insulting, threatening and assaulting the victim as well as wilful breach of peace. The court, presided over by Magistrate Charmaine Galea gave them time to reconsider, warning that the charges carried a possible five-year jail term.  Punishment would be delivered by the juvenile court after a pre-sentencing court report is drawn up. A request for bail was not objected to by the prosecution as long as conditions reflected the ""most serious nature of the crimes."" They were granted bail on condition they do not approach the victim and keep away from the Mosta MCAST campus, signing the bail book twice weekly, a curfew lasting from 11pm and 6am and under a personal guarantee of €5,000 each. Magistrate Galea warned them of the consequences if they were to breach any of those conditions. The court issued a protection order in favour of the victim too. The third teen - a 16-year-old Moroccan student also from St Paul's Bay - was charged with complicity in the mugging by acting as a lookout.  He too pleaded guilty and was granted time to reconsider. He was also granted bail, with the imposed conditions prohibiting him from going to school since he is a student at the MCAST campus. The court imposed a ban on the aggressors' names and a protection order in respect of the victim. AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov together with Inspectors Stephen Gulia and Godwin Scerri prosecuted.  Lawyers Jacob Magri and Arthur Azzopardi are counsel to one of the 16-year-olds. Lawyers Jose' Herrera, Alex Scerri Herrera and Matthew Xuereb assisted the other 16-year-old. A legal aid lawyer assisted the 15-year-old.

Officials unaware how many workers were at Jean Paul Sofia collapse site,Edwina Brincat,"The developers, contractor and architect involved in the Corradino building collapse that killed Jean Paul Sofia in December 2022 were “totally oblivious” of the number of workers on site when the tragedy struck, a court heard on Wednesday. ""No one could tell us the exact number” Assistant Commissioner Kenneth Haber testified as he recounted the scene he witnessed shortly after the building came crashing down during construction works. The police were initially told that “some six workers” were involved, the officer recalled during the compilation of evidence against developers Matthew Schembri and Kurt Buhagiar, project architect Adriana Zammit and contractors Milomar and Dijana Jovicevic. All five are pleading not guilty to the involuntary homicide of 20-year old Jean Paul Sofia who was buried alive under the rubble.   Haber said the site was a hive of activity when he got there, with civil protection officers and paramedics engaged in the rescue operation. Some men were pulled out from the rubble “all covered in concrete,” and the primary task was to determine the number of persons who had been on the site and to account for everyone. But that proved to be difficult. Police and rescue workers spoke to the developers, the architect and the contractor but no one could give the exact number.    Questioned further by parte civile lawyer Joe Giglio whether the accused were in a position to give a head count of those on site at the time of the incident, Haber replied in the negative. “No one was aware of what was going on or the number of persons on site. They were totally oblivious. And I must say that they were also somewhat panicked, to be fair. But we could not get to a number. They could not supply that information.” At one point somebody pointed to a parked van close to the accident site. When police opened that vehicle they found a wallet with the ID card of Jean Paul Sofia inside.   Haber said the police started a triangulation process to locate Sofia’s mobile phone. One of the workers on site, not one of the accused, told the police that Sofia was not one of the workers applying concrete that day, but could have entered the site prior to the collapse.  The case, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Antonello Magri are prosecuting. Lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell is counsel to Zammit. Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are counsel to the developers. Lawyer Timothy Bartolo is counsel to the contractors.

Court orders Film Commission to reveal David Walliams film awards pay,Matthew Xuereb,"A  judge has ordered the Malta Film Commission to reveal how much it paid British comedian and author David Walliams for the Malta Film Awards in January 2022. The judgment confirms earlier decisions by the Information and Data Protection Commissioner and the Data Protection Tribunal. Walliams hosted the elaborate black-tie event that was heavily marketed on billboards across the country and online. Industry insiders suggested the event blasted through its €400,000 budget, with some estimating it cost well over €1.3 million. However, details of how the public funds had been spent remained under wraps.  The commission had denied a Times of Malta Freedom of Information request for details on the cost of the glitzy Awards.  It also denied a Freedom of Information request filed by the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation specifically requesting payments made to Walliams. In the rejection letter, the film commission had cited a legal clause that the requested documents were subject to professional privilege and that their disclosure would amount to breach of confidence. The foundation took the matter to the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) which ruled in its favour, leading to an appeal by the commission before the Data Protection Tribunal, which upheld the IDPC ruling. The IDPC said that the confidentiality clause in the agreement with Walliams could not be used to prevent disclosure of the amount he was paid and the Malta Film Commission had not attempted to explain or substantiate its claim that disclosing the requested invoice would prejudice its affairs or those of Walliams. Following the Data Protection Commissioner’s ruling, the Film Commission took the matter to the civil court, asking it to annul the ruling and revoke the IDPC decision. In a judgment handed down by Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff on Wednesday, the court rejected the film commission’s second appeal, ordering the commission to release the information. The court ruled that the information requested was from a public authority over a contract that it had signed out of its own free will with a service provider. It noted that the law provides for certain exceptions but not when the public authority would have bound itself to confidentiality. “Certainly, to uphold the principles of accountability and transparency, it is duty-bound to reveal and explain how public funds are being spent. The information being requested is related to payments to a person which it chose directly, without a public call,” the judge noted. While observing that the information was of a confidential nature, this did not mean that its publication was going to adversely affect a third party. Mr Justice Mintoff agreed with the IDPC that the confidentiality clause in the agreement with Walliams could not be used to prevent disclosure of the amount he was paid. The judge threw out the film commission’s appeal and ruled that it must hand over an electronic copy of the invoices it received in connection with Walliams’ hosting of the Malta Film Awards in January 2022 to the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation. The Malta Film Commission and its head, Commissioner Johann Grech, have been repeatedly in the headlines over the past year, especially after Times of Malta revealed that between 2019 and 2023, the government awarded €143 million in taxpayers’ money to 54 films and television series. While the Maltese producers spend almost all the film’s budget directly in the Maltese economy, foreign production houses spent nearly half of their budget abroad and still got refunded the 40% for it, leading local film-makers to question to what extent the country benefited from handing out such a huge rebate. The National Audit Office is investigating the Malta Film Commission’s spending on a 40 per cent cashback scheme. The probe was launched in response to a letter from opposition MPs Darren Carabott, David Agius, Graham Bencini, and Julie Zahra asking the Auditor General to investigate the spending.

Conservation order for palazzo that was home to lateral thinker Edward de Bono,Jessica Arena,"A Marsaxlokk palazzo that was once home to Edward de Bono the father of lateral thinking, has been placed under a conservation order after signs of neglect and squatting were observed on the historic property.  Palazzo Marnisi, said to date back to 1650, sits on high ground overlooking Marsaxlokk bay and is surrounded by agricultural land. The Superintendence of Cultural Heritage said that a site inspection revealed that the property had suffered extensive vandalism, squatting and abandonment.  “Artefacts of clear heritage value have also been found broken and others were possibly stolen,” the superintendence said in a statement.   Photo: Superintendence of Cultural Heritage     By issuing a conservation and protection order on the palazzo, the SCH said it was ordering the owners to safeguard the building and protect it from vandalism and unwarranted access. Any work carried out on the building to this aim will also have to be approved by the SCH.  The building owners have 15 days to respond to the order after notification.  De Bono rented Palzzo Marnisi for many years and it served as his registered address in Malta. He lived overseas for a large part of his life but was known to have returned to Malta in his final years and resided in Rabat during that time.  A year after he died in 2021, The Guardian revealed that while de Bono had always appeared to be a very wealthy man, his will featured only £11,900 in his estate.    The palazzo appears to be up for sale for €10 million. It is being advertised as a “one-off” property that “needs to be viewed to be truly appreciated”. The listing doesn’t specifically name the property as Palazzo Marnisi but the pictures included in the listing match known images of the building.  According to the listing, although the internal area of the palazzo spans some 260 sqm, the entire plot up for sale is 37,1000 sqm in total, with 18,000 sqm or 16 tumoli of workable land.

"Nun linked to Gozo orphanage abuse case dies, survivors vow to fight on",Giulia Magri,"One of the nuns linked to allegations of abuse at the Lourdes Home orphanage in Gozo, Carmelita Borg, has died.  Her death, at the age of 78, was announced on Tuesday evening by the Santwarju Madonna ta’ Pompej Facebook page. The Mother Superior for the Dominican nuns was responsible for the Lourdes Home orphanage in Għajnsielem at the time the alleged abuse took place several decades ago.    Earlier this month, survivors testified in court how they were subject to sexual abuse and regular beatings in the Church-run orphanage they lived in during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The court heard the testimony of two women, Carmen Muscat and Rosanne Saliba, who were raised decades ago at the Lourdes Home in Għajnsielem which is run by the Dominican Sisters.  The women recounted how the nuns would beat them for no reason, locked them up alone for days and forced them to live in fear.  Saliba told Times of Malta that she will continue fighting for justice for herself and the other victims.  ""I hope to God that she wrote down that the abuse in our time did exist and that she did not take the necessary action for it,"" she said. ""Secondly, I hope Mother Superior wrote down why she kept so much information from me when she was involved in what was going on."" In court, Saliba had recounted how she had only learnt that her biological mother had died by chance. She said that when she asked the Mother Superior what happened to her mother, the nun said that her mother had been dead for two years.   ""She went to the other side, and I am here suffering, is that fair? Not at all."" Saliba said she will continue to fight for justice, for herself and the other victims.  Muscat meanwhile told Times of Malta that she was informed on Wednesday morning that the nun died. “All I can say is now she is in God’s Hands,” she said. Muscat had told the court that as she grew older, another of the nuns, ""Sister Josephine"" took her to see a priest in a private part of the building. There, she was forced to touch herself, and she recalled how a priest had exposed himself to her during confession. Abuse at the Għajnsielem home is alleged to have stretched for decades. The Church first acknowledged it in 1999, when it set up a commission which concluded allegations were unfounded. Claims then came to public attention in 2006, when survivors ranging in age from their 20s to 40s described horrific abuse on the TV show Bondi+. In 2008, a second Church commission to investigate abuse claims found evidence of “inadmissible behaviour involving minors” at the home. The Gozo Bishop at the time, Mario Grech, had issued a statement asking survivors for forgiveness and ordered that the commission’s recommendations be implemented. In 2011, police launched a probe into the Lourdes Home and two of its nuns, Sr Josephine Anne Sultana and vicar general Sr Dorothy Mizzi, in connection with an abuse claim filed by a boy dating back five years prior You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man who committed armed robbery spared jail as he tries to kick drugs habit,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who is striving to kick a drug addiction that led him to commit crimes to sustain the habit has been spared four years in jail. Madam Justice Edwina Grima upheld a recommendation by the man’s probation officer to allow him to continue his remarkable progress. Shamison Stafrace, 25, appealed a four-year jail sentence after he was found guilty of committing an armed hold-up at a convenience shop in Triq Għajn Dwieli, in Paola at 8.30pm on April 16, 2019. The accused was also convicted of holding the cashier against her will and of slightly injuring a woman who happened to be shopping at the time. The court heard how Stafrace had carried out the hold-up with another person, both of whom were wearing hoodies. The cashier managed to pull off Stafrace’s hoodie, revealing his face. The cashier told the police about the tattoos he had on his neck. The thieves had made off with around €300 in cash. A DNA sample on a hoodie found outside the shop was used to pin the crime on the accused. The first court had sentenced him to an effective jail term because, despite having been given many opportunities to reform, he had not done his best to change his life’s path. But, on appeal, Madam Justice Grima heard his probation officer explain how he was following Stafrace under a temporary supervision order. This was done both at the request of the accused and as ordered by the court to shed light on whether he was really changing his ways and staying away from criminality. The probation officer said it was evident that he had changed his life for the better, he was making good progress in his commitment to overcome the drug addiction, always tested negative for illicit substances and had a stable job as a self-employed plasterer. He had a structured and stable life and that was well on the right path. Given the circumstances, the court converted the effective jail term into a probation order so that Stafrace could continue progressing while under the watchful eyes of his probation officer.

"10,000 apply for bus cards after administration fees waiver",Times of Malta,"More than 10,000 have applied for a bus card since the announcement that applications will be free of charge until the end of February, Transport Minister Chris Bonnet said on Wednesday. ""We will continue to work on measures to encourage the use of public transport,"" he said in a Facebook post.  The free Tallinja buscard announcement was made earlier this month. Transport Malta had said that the application fee was being waived until the end of February, but bus fares for non-card users were being raised.    Non-card users will be charged €2.50 instead of €2 per ticket purchased on the bus with cash or via the contactless payment facility. While the seven-day bus card for children will be reduced from €15 to €7, the same card for adults will increase to €25 from €21. A 12-day journey card will increase to €21 from €15.  The new tariffs came into force on Monday.  The bus service became free for bus card holders in October 2022. At that time Malta was the second country in Europe where public transport was free. A record 67.3 million passenger trips were made on the buses last year, up from 49.6 million in 2022.   Bus card holders are also entitled to free use of the ferries between Sliema, Cottonera and Valletta, including the use of the Upper Barrakka lift.

Malta's first legal cannabis club begins operating,James Cummings,"Malta's first cannabis club has begun distributing the drug to its members, the authority overseeing the sector has announced. KDD Society, which was given an operating licence in October 2023, has passed all mandatory laboratory tests, the Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis (ARUC) said on Tuesday.  Officially called 'Cannabis Harm Reduction Associations', the clubs are the only way people can buy the drug legally since Malta became the first EU Member State to legalise the use of the drug. The authority said its tests ensured that cannabis cultivated and distributed by the clubs were ""free from unwanted contaminants"" and reminded the public that legal cannabis should be distributed in containers with the ARUC label.   These included a 'Phytocannabinoid Profile', which is a test for the cannabinoid content and potency.  The authority also tested the drug for micro-organism analyte, bacteria, yeast and mold count, mycotoxins, trace / heavy metal analyte, water activity and moisture content and filth and foreign Material. The authority said it was “pleased” that one year on from rules for clubs being established, a registered association had begun operating “in a highly regulated manner based on a public health and harm reduction approach."" Referring to the association by its registration number CHRA 002, the authority said it had passed all mandatory laboratory tests and reminded social media users that legal cannabis should be distributed in containers with an ARUC label and seal. To join and buy cannabis in Malta, you must be a Maltese resident.  The news comes three months after KDD society and another association were granted a license to operate, allowing them to legally grow and sell cannabis. In an interview with Times of Malta a few days after the announcement, KDD society president Kenneth Ellul said it had been a “stressful” application process. There are currently six associations registered to grow and sell cannabis in Malta, according to the ARUC website. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Bernard Grech recalls how he was told not to enter the PN's club in Hamrun,Edwina Brincat,"PN leader Bernard Grech told a court on Tuesday that he was told not to enter his party's own club in Ħamrun during the town's feast in August because there were many Labourites in there and a drink too many could spark trouble. Grech was testifying in the case against Andrew Attard, 48, of Ħamrun who denies grievously injuring Noel Mifsud Bonnici during a scuffle which followed. The PN leader testified that minutes before the commotion outside the club, the club barman told him that it would be better not to enter since “there were many Labour supporters in there” and a drink too many could spark trouble. He recalled that on that Sunday morning, he was visiting various clubs and establishments in Ħamrun along with his wife, driver and a group of supporters. As he approached the PN club, he had “a discussion with Manuel,” who was a member of the party’s Ħamrun committee as well as club barman. “He came out to speak to me,” said Grech, explaining that Manuel “seemed quite surprised at my presence.” He asked him not to go in because people had had a drink too many and there were many Labour supporters in there.  That conversation was conducted in a low voice but some “two or so” persons promptly began to complain, protesting over how the party leader could not enter the party club.     RELATED STORIES  But being “a pacifist”, Grech said he did not wish the situation to escalate and thus stepped back, along with his wife and the rest of the group.  They turned around, stepped off the pavement and walked a few metres away when he suddenly heard a noise, like “oomph,” and people tried to protect him and his wife, said Grech. They were told that Noel Mifsud Bonnici had been injured. Grech said he found Mifsud Bonnici lying face up on the ground, opposite the PN club. “He spoke to me. He told me ‘I cannot get up. It’s my leg. You go on and keep up your work,"" recalled Grech. Asked by presiding magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo whether he recalled any conversation between the alleged victim and the barman, Grech said that at the time, the most important thing was to avoid issues. “There were many comments but I cannot tell exactly what or by whom… I wish I could give more information to help the police. It’s not right for anyone to end up a victim during festive celebrations and this was a religious feast,” said Grech. Asked by parte civile lawyer George Camilleri about having “distanced himself from the situation,” Grech clarified that, “there was no situation when [he] and Manuel spoke on the pavement. ""When I sensed that this could escalate, we turned to leave.” Asked whether he had spoken with Mifsud Bonnici, Grech explained that the two regularly communicated, not only about the incident. He also visited him in hospital and recalled that he was in pain.   After being discharged, Mifsud Bonnici visited Grech at his office. Jesmond Cremona, a PN supporter who was accompanying Grech that morning, testified that the group were met by a “well-built and bald man” at the PN club doorway. People were going in and out of the place, a commotion broke out, and there was a lot of pushing. When calm was restored, Cremona said he approached the burly man, asking him why he would not let Grech in.   “No. Today you’re not going inside. Go elsewhere. Here, you’re not going in,” that man insisted, as a black-haired woman intervened, pushing Cremona away. Just then, someone tugged at Cremona’s shirt, saying that “someone from the group was on the ground.” That was when Cremona found Mifsud Bonnici crying out in pain, “my knee! My knee!” The injured supporter said that someone had kicked him on the knee but he could not tell who. Grech’s driver and security officer, Norman Cremona, also testified. He recalled a slight verbal spat that morning in Ħamrun when Grech was not allowed into the club. But they calmed down the situation and moved away, said Cremona, stressing that his duty was to protect Grech. He was told that someone was injured but he could not tell who was involved. “I saw the commotion but my focus was on the Opposition Leader. I only saw Noel on the ground… it was a matter of seconds,” he said. Earlier on, when the argument broke out, Cremona had told Mifsud Bonnici that matters should not be dragged out and the issue should not escalate t. Asked by defence lawyer Charles Mercieca whether he could identify anyone in court whom he had seen that day in Ħaamrun, the witness said, “no.” “I only saw Noel on the ground.” The case continues. Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa prosecuted. Lawyer Charles Mercieca is defence counsel. Lawyer George Camilleri appeared parte civile.

"Anti-Poverty Forum welcomes price cuts, seeks power subsidies cut for the rich",Times of Malta,"The Anti-Poverty Forum, a grouping of 17 NGOs working in the social field in Malta, has welcomed the government’s efforts to 'encourage' businesses to reduce the prices of daily basic necessities. ""It is an action which was badly needed, and which will help those who are at the lower levels of the earning pyramid to be more able to afford the basic necessities for their families,"" the forum said. It was referring to an agreement reached by the government with importers and retailers to reduce the prices of some 400 items by 15% from February 1. The forum said the country needs a system where prices of basic items were regularly monitored. It called for an arrangement where discussions with providers took place regularly. The forum also argued that policies and schemes should not put everyone in the same basket, since by doing so one would be treating unfairly those who are in a disadvantaged position. ""A clear example of this is the subsidised energy for all. Well-off persons tend to consume more energy as they tend to live in larger houses and with more appliances at home. Since energy is being subsidised for everyone, well-off people are being subsidised more than those who really need to be subsidised. Consequently, the available subsidies are not reaching those people who need them most. Schemes can be put in place where subsidies are means-tested, and therefore directed exclusively towards supporting low-income earners,"" the forum said. It also pointed out that a reduction of energy subsidies across the board would also contribute towards a cleaner environment, enticing a reduction in consumption.

At last - Gozo's Dar San Ġużepp is to welcome its first residents,Times of Malta,"Dar San Ġużepp, a new home for the elderly in Għajnsielem, Gozo, will welcome its first residents in March, the Gozo ministry said on Tuesday. ""We kept our word in the past five months and works will be completed so that the home can become operational. Applications for Gozitans wishing to live at the home will open in the coming days,"" Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri was quoted in a government statement as saying during a visit. The project goes back to 2013 when the government rented the Church property. The project was granted a development permit in 2014 and works on the conversion began in early 2015. The project suffered repeated delays, with more than €1 million being spent on rent. A year ago a court upheld a decision for CareMalta to be awarded a €30 million government contract to equip and manage the home.  The house will eventually house 120 residents in en suite homes over four floors enjoying sea and country views.      You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Malta's economic performance 'impressive' but inequality on the rise, IMF says",Neville Borg,"Malta’s “impressive” recovery from the pandemic has also brought about greater pressures on the country’s infrastructure and a rise in income inequality, the International Monetary Fund said in its annual assessment published on Tuesday. The report noted how Malta’s post-pandemic recovery was largely supported by “large inflows of foreign workers, allowing rapid labor force growth”. While this has brought about significant economic growth, it warned that “the provision of physical infrastructure (e.g., roads) and public services (e.g., health) has not caught up with population growth”. IMF also observed that income inequality and poverty risk appear to be on the rise, with the elderly population showing signs of being increasingly at risk since the pandemic. The rate of income inequality - or the gap between high and low earners - has risen above the EU average since the pandemic, IMF said. Meanwhile, the overall risk of poverty is similar to that in the rest of the bloc at around 17%. While IMF expects Malta’s economy to continue to grow at a moderate pace, with inflation gradually easing over the coming years, it once again called on the government to phase out the energy subsidies. The government is set to spend over €320m on energy subsidies this year alone. These subsidies, the IMF argued, disincentivise energy savings and green investments and account for some 40% of Malta’s deficit. The IMF had similarly argued for energy subsidies to be phased out in several previous reports. In its most recent report, the IMF noted that Maltese authorities stood firm on this recommendation, saying that “they did not, however, agree with allowing greater pass-through of market energy prices to consumers, whilst stressing the importance of investments in renewable energy sources”. In a Facebook post reacting to the report, Prime Minister Robert Abela described the energy subsidies as “crucial”, saying that their cost would not prevent the government from investing further in the country. Abela noted that the IMF had praised Malta’s economic leadership, saying that Malta is set to have one of the highest levels of economic growth in Europe.   Meanwhile, the property market is showing some signs of slowdown, with residential property prices “decelerating” and real estate transactions dipping. More broadly, the IMF welcomed Malta’s progress in improving its anti-money laundering framework, finding that monitoring has been boosted and risks reduced across most sectors. It also called on Malta to develop a roadmap for the implementation of the global minimum corporate tax regime. Malta had previously announced that it would be delaying the introduction of this measure, which is expected to impact some 660 multinational companies with a base in the country.

"‘No idea how I lived this long,’ says centenarian",Mark Laurence Zammit,"Meeting Mary Gauci in her tiny home in Għajnsielem makes you wonder whether she really turned 100 last week. She looks more like 85. The Gozitan centenarian lives in a small house sandwiched between two larger houses on a quiet street. She does grocery shopping on her own, cooks every day, sweeps and cleans the house, washes and hangs clothes, uses a mobile phone to make calls, does not use a walking stick and climbs up and down a companion ladder that leads to her roof. She takes things more slowly nowadays, she has no illnesses, loves to eat cakes and sweets, occasionally drinks alcohol, watches game shows on television, follows the news and has a lucid memory and clear mind.   “I have no idea how I’m still alive, I genuinely don’t,” she told Times of Malta in her kitchen, shortly after she had finished cooking spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch. She had made sure she bought fresh fish and vegetables early that morning so she would have her meal prepared before the interview. She has never smoked or eaten junk food but neither has she bothered to exercise or do some special diet.   “I won’t say no to a good pastry and I do take the occasional Bailey’s or vermouth,” she said. Neither is she care-free. On the contrary, she admits she is a big worrier. “But I don’t feel like I’m 100, and all I can say for that is ‘thank you Lord’. Other than that, I don’t know how I made it this far.” Well, for starters, Mary never got married. At least 14 men would have given anything to marry her, she insists, but she lived with her aunt at the time – who was like a mother to her – and she did not want to abandon her. She did fancy a couple of them and her aunt urged her to marry. A couple of men wanted her so badly they even offered to bring her aunt along to live with them, but Mary would not budge. She does not regret the decision and does not feel she missed out on life by not having children, although she does confess to feeling lonely at times.   “But prayer consoles me. I pray to God and the Holy Mary and I feel better. “And God hasn’t left me alone either, because I have friends and neighbours constantly coming to see me and help me. They spend hours here every day and I’m eternally grateful to them.” One of those neighbours is Ċikka, who accompanied Mary for the first part of the interview but left after her 100-year-old friend reminded her she had an appointment. When Mary turned 100 on January 17, Ċikka and their other neighbours organised a surprise party for her, despite her warnings that she did not want anyone to know about the big day. “I just wanted to stay at home, watch the mass on TV and thank the Lord here. But they did it anyway and I ended up loving it,” she said. “I cried with joy seeing all those people surrounding me and congratulating me. I really didn’t expect it would be so wonderful.” Gauci was born in the UK to a British mother and Gozitan father. At five she travelled to Gozo to visit her aunt – supposedly for a year – and stayed. She returned to the UK for a holiday 50 years later. Her younger sister Gloria – now well into her 80s – still lives in the UK and visits frequently. She was at the party, of course.   Mary and Gloria are the only remaining siblings from a family of 14 and most of her friends have also passed away. Mary would not say she had a particularly tough life. Even during the war, she and her aunt always had food because Mary had found a job at a nearby bakery and brought home fresh bread every day. A bomb almost killed her aunt one day. “I was at church when we heard the airplane approaching. We knew it was a war plane. As I was walking back home I heard a huge explosion that seemed to come from the street where we lived,” she said.   “I was sure a bomb had been dropped on our house and that I would find my aunt dead. She was sick at home that day.” Mary ran home and the bomb had come down a few doors up the road, killing five people. Mary is not your typical nostalgic older woman. She does recall a Gozo with no cars and few houses but it was not necessarily a better place. “Life was hard, you know. You couldn’t do a lot of things and it was hard to go to many places. Great improvements have been made and I think Gozo is better now,” she said. “What I’m really worried and frustrated about is the way morality, religion and the Church have taken a hit.” That is the only thing Mary is nostalgic for. She cannot bear to see people abandoning the Church and its Catholic values. She furiously followed the abortion debate last year, in disbelief at how the country could even consider legalising it. She loves life but is not too bothered about living much longer. It’s up to the guy upstairs, she says. She prays every day to secure a place in heaven. Until then, she spends her days serenely at home. She wakes up at 6.30am every morning, says a short prayer and prepares tea, cappuccino or hot chocolate. She loves tea but does not like coffee.   By noon she has usually cooked, cleaned the house, washed the clothes and spent time with her neighbours. After lunch she takes a nap, then recites the rosary, does some more chores, prepares dinner, sips on an evening tea and helps herself to a fruit while watching game shows on Italian TV. The day ends with another prayer. Her advice on living a long, happy life is simple: “Live a good life, be careful of everything that is bad around you and take care of your health. And oh, always say the rosary.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Malta perceived to be just as corrupt as last year – report,James Cummings,"The level of corruption in Malta has remained unchanged since last year, according to a report monitoring corruption around the world. The country achieved a rating of 51 out of 100 in the 2023 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) published by Transparency International, the same score as last year. As such, the report suggests Malta would be classified as a “flawed democracy”, as its score matched closest to the average for that type of government. On average, flawed democracies achieved a score of 48. Countries are scored from zero to 100, with zero meaning “highly corrupt” and 100 “very clean”. The index scores countries based on how corrupt their public sector is thought to be by business leaders and experts in the field. But while Malta’s score remained the same as last year, its overall ranking slipped one place to 55 out of the 180 countries surveyed, putting it just behind Saudi Arabia. The only EU countries to score lower than Malta were Croatia (which achieved a score of 50), Greece (49), Romania (46), Bulgaria (45), and Hungary (42). EU candidate countries Moldova and North Macedonia also ranked low on the list, joining Hungary with scores of 42. Malta achieved its highest score (60) in 2015, but apart from a small improvement in 2017 has seen a trend of decline since. In a section of the report on judicial independence, Transparency International highlighted a European Commission report which found identified issues in the justice system of eight EU countries, including Malta.  Transparency International noted that “a recent European Parliament resolution called on the Maltese authorities to step up investigations into possible instances of former public officials attempting to conceal evidence and obstruct investigations and judicial proceedings of the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.” Discussing Western Europe and the EU as a region, the CPI said “weak accountability and political corruption” were undermining the rule of law and trust in public institutions. ""In the most alarming cases, narrow interest groups have too much control over political decision-making. In others, governments are targeting journalists, whistleblowers and other watchdogs,” it said. Describing anti-corruption efforts in the region as having “stagnated or declined,” the report noted that only six countries saw improved scores from last year, while eight have continued to decline since 2012. It said that even high-ranking regional democracies such as Sweden, Netherlands, Iceland and the UK recorded their lowest-ever scores. On a global level, Transparency International said there had been a decline in justice and rule of law since 2016, highlighting a “rise in authoritarianism” and a weakening of checks and balances in democracies. ""Governments across the political spectrum have undermined justice systems, restricted civic freedoms and relied on non-democratic strategies to address recent challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic”, it said. And overall, only 28 countries have managed to improve their score over the last 12 years while 34 have seen corruption significantly worsen. “Despite progress made across the planet in criminalising corruption and establishing specialised institutions to address it, corruption levels remain stagnant globally."" The index had, since 1995, been Transparency International’s flagship research product and a leading global indicator of public sector corruption ranking countries and territories from all over the globe. To determine a country’s corruption score it examines instances of bribery, diversion of public funds, officials going unpunished using public office for private gain and bureaucracy being used for corrupt purposes. It also looks at nepotistic appointments, public officials disclosing their finances, legal protections for whistleblowers, vested interests and the level of public access to government information. Denmark and Finland retained their position as the least corrupt, unchanged from last year. The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation is Transparency International's Malta contact.

In pictures: Ship coaling in early Malta,Giovanni Bonello,"Through the 19th and early 20th century, Malta positioned itself as one of the foremost coaling stations in the Mediterranean. Large ships ran on steam engines, which burned through massive amounts of coal.   The vast British war fleet, troopships, merchant vessels and passenger liners all wolfed down coal like there was no tomorrow. Malta became the port of choice where ships tried to satiate insatiable appetites.   Coaling of ships was no pretty affair. It involved punishing manual labour, exposure to filth, devastating lung cancer, danger and beggarly remuneration for the ‘natives’.    Notwithstanding the wild deficit of glamour surrounding it, coaling all the same managed to become the subject of a considerable number of commercial real-photo postcards. The ‘natives’ carried out the dirty work, Maltese coal importers joined the mega wealthy and the vessels were serviced without a whimper.   Ship coaling also enriched the Maltese language. To this day, we use the phrase għandu l-faħam miblul. Why? Labourers devised ways to supplement mean incomes. Coal barges approaching the ships, generally open and overloaded, made it easy to flip some coals overboard. Again, the overfull wicker baskets the labourers balanced over their shoulders or on their heads while climbing the ladders or planks from barge to ship would ‘lose’ some coals to the sea in transit.  A large gang of Maltese workers who supplied coal to ships in the harbours.    After the ship’s departure, divers would recover the coal from the seabed, dry the lumps to resell – wet coal: faħam miblul – something deceitful to hide. Clandestine business in pilfered and inferior damp coal turned into acceptable trade practice.   Mighty battleships were often photographed with funnels belching thick black smoke, a catastrophic pollutant. Perhaps they believed this reinforced the macho image of the war machines.

"Man who threatened to hurl a barrel of acid at activist gets €5,000 fine",Edwina Brincat,"Updated with details at 10.13am. A man who in a Facebook post said he would “hurl a barrel of acid"" at Repubblika president Repubblika president Robert Aquilina was sentenced to nine months imprisonment suspended for three years on Tuesday. He was also fined €5,000. Johann Vella was convicted of hate speech over a comment he wrote in March  under a post by Godwin Schembri. Schembri had shared a story about a protest organised by the NGO Repubblika outside former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s Sa Maison office on March 1. That protest followed a damning judgement which had just been delivered about the fraudulent hospitals’ privatisation deal.  Vella's comment ran along the lines that “if some clown sticks trash on my property I would hurl a barrel of acid at him,” adding that Aquilina was “trash.” Aquilina had told the court that he interpreted that as a threat and as instigating violence against him.  He also complained that such comments had an effect on his life and that of my family as others might put words into action.  When delivering judgment, Magistrate Ian Farrugia observed that Aquilina as NGO president, was “vociferous” in his criticism not only against the government and other top figures, but also against former prime minister Joseph Muscat.  The political climate was highly charged and while Repubblika and Aquilina had followers, Muscat’s figure was certainly viewed as important in the eyes of those who supported him.  Muscat had to accept criticism against him, no matter how harsh, although he had a right to ensure that such criticism fell within legal parameters.  The same applied to Aquilina, observed the court.  In this case, Aquilina’s press conference which triggered the whole episode, was “clear, direct, but above all else, peaceful.”  The same could not be said about Vella who opted to resort to words that were not only harsh but doubtlessly threatening and abusive. Taken in context, his comment amounted to incitement to violence and hatred against Aquilina. It was blatantly in breach of law. The particular provision was designed by the legislator to place a limit on personal liberty in a society “that aspires to be civilized and democratic.” When all was considered the court declared Vella guilty and condemned him to a nine-month jail term suspended for three years and a fine of €5000.

Vaccination uptake steers Malta clear from measles outbreak,Giulia Magri,"As Europe experiences a surge in measles cases, Malta has managed to keep the infectious disease controlled through a strong uptake in vaccinations. The World Health Organisation (WHO) marked an “alarming” increase in measles cases in Europe last year. According to the UN agency, more than 30,0000 cases were reported between January and October, compared with 941 cases in the whole of 2022 – more than a 30-fold rise. A highly contagious disease, measles is caused by a virus and spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Symptoms can start as a cold, which then progresses to a high fever, cough, and a red rash across the body and face. If not treated, measles infection can lead to severe complications and death.  While measles can affect anyone, it is most common in children. According to the WHO, two in five cases were children between the ages of one and four years old, and one in every five cases was among adults 20 years and older. Following the WHO’s warning, the United Kingdom declared a “national incident” amid a surge in measles cases. The UK’s health authorities noted a sharp rise in the number of measles cases, while the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is at its lowest in more than a decade. Malta bucked the trend. A health ministry spokesperson said there were no confirmed cases or deaths of measles in Malta last year and so far in 2024. The spokesperson said clinicians and laboratories are legally obliged to notify public health authorities of measles cases. “Moreover, public health authorities regularly communicate with healthcare professionals on infectious diseases of note, including measles, and their obligation and importance of timely reporting so cases are investigated and prompt public health measures are taken as necessary to prevent further transmission,” the spokesperson told Times of Malta. “The health ministry encourages all parents to vaccinate their children. Malta has managed to keep many infectious diseases controlled through good uptake of vaccination.”   Measles can be entirely prevented through a two-dose vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine. The WHO noted that the first dose of measles vaccine in the region decreased from 96 per cent in 2019 to 93 per cent in 2022. The second dose coverage also fell, from 92 per cent in 2019 to 91 per cent in 2022. In Malta, the vaccine is offered free of charge to those born after 1982 through the National Immunisation Service as part of the National Immunisation Schedule. The first dose is given at 13 months and the second when the child is over three years old. Unvaccinated adults can also take the vaccine, with at least eight weeks apart between the two doses. The Maltese health authorities noted a slight dip in MMR vaccination rates in 2021 but recovered in the following years. “In 2021 the vaccination rate dropped to 91 per cent for both the first and second doses, but then picked up to 96 per cent and 95 per cent respectively for the first and second doses in 2022,” the spokesperson explained. The decline in MMR vaccinations in 2021 was attributed to the pandemic, where people were reluctant to visit health centres, if not unwell. This was seen in most countries, however for Malta, the vaccination rates recovered well in subsequent years. In 2021, 91 per cent of children between the ages of 12 and 18 months received the first dose of MMR and 90 per cent of children had received a second dose by the age of four. In 2022, the percentage of those vaccinated with the first dose by 18 months shot up by five  per cent. While the official figures for 2023 are still being processed, the spokesperson said the indications for the uptake are positive.

Could parliamentary immunity ‘save’ Joseph Muscat?,Jacob Borg,"Joseph Muscat’s possible return to frontline politics has led to accusations he is seeking to benefit from European Parliament immunity. The ex-prime minister’s potential election bid comes amid a money-laundering and corruption probe into his role in the failed Vitals/Steward hospitals’ concession. Muscat, who denies wrongdoing, opened the door to the prospect of contesting the June European Parliament elections on the Labour ticket. PN MEP candidate Peter Agius suggested that the ex-prime minister’s real game is to protect himself from prosecution, thanks to the immunity granted to all MEPs. Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba has dismissed the immunity argument as “frivolous”, as MEPs have even had their immunity stripped “over a simple parking ticket”. So, what are the rules? Much like Maltese MPs, MEPs benefit from immunity for any opinions and votes taken within parliament. In Malta, this is more commonly known as parliamentary privilege. The immunity is meant to prevent MEPs from being impeded or intimidated by any type of judicial proceedings brought against them because of their parliamentary work.   Immunity in the European Parliament goes one step further, as its members also benefit from a “personal immunity” that protects them from the threat of arrest or legal proceedings during travel and in the course of their parliamentary work. This immunity is, however, far from absolute. The European Parliament has the right to waive immunity, and generally does so, unless there are reasons to believe that a prosecution is politically motivated. Both Muscat and, more recently, Prime Minister Robert Abela have sought to cast doubts on the integrity of the Vitals/Steward inquiry. If local prosecutors were to proceed against Muscat, they would likely put in a request to the European Parliament to waive his immunity. An MEP also has the right to “defend” his or her immunity in front of the EP legal affairs committee. Muscat insists that the immunity argument is moot, as a serious investigation will find he has done nothing wrong. MEPs do sometimes put up a legal fight to protect their immunity. Eva Kaili, a suspect in the Qatargate bribery scandal which rocked the European Parliament, had sought to derail a separate probe by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office into her potential misuse of EU funds.  Kaili had sought to annul a request for her immunity to be lifted as part of the investigation into alleged fraudulent payments made to four of her parliamentary assistants. The General Court of the European Union this month dismissed the attempt as “inadmissible in its entirety”. It said the request for the lifting of immunity is “a preliminary and necessary measure” to ensure the effectiveness of the investigations, where the immunity from which a person benefits is an obstacle to an investigation relating to him or her. The court said that until a final decision on lifting the immunity is taken by the European Parliament, Kaili continues to benefit from the protection of the privileges and immunities granted by EU law.

"Close Malta air space, sea to weapons of war: NGOs, individuals urge government",Times of Malta,"A group of NGOs and individuals including former president Marie Louise Coleiro Preca are urging Malta to close its air space and waters to carriers of weapons of war. In a statement addressed to the Prime Minister and his government, the signatories, who identify as people committed to working for justice, equality and peace, say that international humanitarian law and United Nations peace resolutions were becoming ineffective. ""We are concerned that many Western states are supporting an unprecedented Israeli military siege and carnage in Gaza and mass raids and arrests in the Occupied West Bank. ""We are concerned that this war is spreading to other countries,"" they said in the letter. The group acknowledged Malta's ""important lead"" as a member of the UN Security Council to promote peace, as well as efforts by the government, MEPs and diplomats within OSCE fora. They note, however, that Malta’s aim of “actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations” as a neutral state can only be accomplished by “adhering to a policy of non-alignment and refusing to participate in any military alliance”. This means that no foreign military base is allowed on Maltese territory and no military facilities on the island can be used by foreign forces. ""However, for many months of horrific slaughter in Gaza, we have allowed foreign military forces to pass through our air and sea space transporting massive numbers of weapons of war... ""Malta’s constitution is the bedrock of our progressive nation. We say no to war. And as a people, we have said no to militarism, many times in recent history."" Disarmament, they added, was essential for peace.   The signatories recalled that following the ""NATO invasion of Libya"" in 2011, Malta had faced ""bitter criticism"" for allowing Maltese airspace to be used by foreign military forces taking part in the civil war. In 2020, people again united to object to the cabinet considering US proposals for a Situation of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Malta, while a survey commissioned by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 2022 showed that 63% of the Maltese were strongly in favour of the island's position of international neutrality.   ""As the death toll in Gaza rises to over 25,000 people including 10,500 children; as the number of injured people rises to over 62,000 people and the number of missing people to over 8,000; as the UN chief António Guterres denounces Israel for the ‘heartbreaking’ deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, we the undersigned say: Enough is Enough! ""No more carriers of weapons of war will be permitted to pass through Malta’s air and sea space. We call on Malta to take this tangible step toward peace. We call on all other countries to stand up for humanity, for effective humanitarian laws, and demilitarisation.""

Lawyers warn PM against turning hospitals case into political scapegoat,Times of Malta,"The Chamber of Advocates on Monday warned Robert Abela against turning the hospitals' inquiry into a scapegoat to deflect attention from the need for procedural reforms within the justice sector. Lawyers also urged the Prime Minister to refrain from personal attacks against the judiciary to gain political mileage.  The chamber was reacting to a five-minute outburst by the Prime Minister on Friday. Last week Abela stridently criticised Magistrate Gabriella Vella for, in his view, taking too long to conclude a magisterial inquiry into people involved in the fraudulent hospitals' privatisation deal. Without mentioning the magistrate by name, Abela said the inquiry was taking too long and questioned whether it was being timed to coincide with the European Parliament elections, to be held this summer. His criticism echoes that of his predecessor Joseph Muscat, who is fighting in court to have the magistrate taken off the case. Muscat alleges that Vella is not impartial because of social media posts published by her relatives. In a statement on Monday, the PN said it expected Abela to issue a public apology for his comments. In a separate statement, the Chamber of Advocates acknowledged that four and a half years were ""indeed a considerable duration"" for the conclusion of an inquiry. However, one also needed to consider other matters being handled by magistrates, as well as their ever-increasing caseload, the chamber added. ""Indeed it is imperative to recognise that the issues at hand extend beyond the specifics of this case. There is a pressing need to reassess and enhance the overall system governing inquiries, not only in this particular instance."" So much so that the government recently appointed a number of magistrates to focus on inquiries, it said. ""It is crucial to refrain from using this case as a scapegoat to deflect attention from the broader need for procedural reforms that lie within the purview of that very entity empowered to enact such changes, led by the Prime Minister who is the individual responsible for making such comments. ""Moreover, it is paramount that any discourse surrounding the inquiry process refrains from engaging in personal attacks against the Judiciary purely to gain political mileage for an entity or individual."" The chamber said the judiciary played a vital role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for all, and any critique should be conducted with respect and adherence to due process. The chamber also urged for a ""serene environment"" for the Judiciary to carry out its duties effectively. ""Creating an atmosphere conducive to fair and impartial adjudication is essential for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.""

Watch: What do Labour MPs think of a Joseph Muscat return to politics?,Karl-Andrew Micallef,"Labour’s MPs have followed their boss Robert Abela’s lead by welcoming talk of a Joseph Muscat return while raising doubts about an inquiry probing him and others. Times of Malta spoke to more than a dozen PL MPs as they entered parliament on Monday, to see what they think about Muscat potentially returning to politics as a candidate in June's European Parliament elections. All, bar a handful, emphasised Muscat’s achievements as prime minister and downplayed questions about his controversies.   Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne said: ""He was a prime minister who gave a lot to our country. I think the Labour Party has a lot to thank Joseph Muscat for. And from the responses I’m seeing, the people seem to have the same sentiment."" Others, such as Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli and Parliamentary Secretary Alison Zerafa Civelli, made it clear they would be happy to have Muscat back in frontline politics. Parliamentary secretary Malcolm Paul Agius Galea took a more cautious approach and said he would not comment until the party did so. Only Randolph Debattista, who aside from being a PL MP also serves as party CEO, was less than enthused by news of a Muscat comeback. “Those who have followed my political thoughts can draw conclusions about what I think,” Debattista said cryptically. The PL CEO had openly called for the party to rid itself of “criminals” as public protests erupted at the end of Muscat’s time in government in late 2019. He was subsequently sacked as CEO only to be reinstated two years later. Times of Malta also asked Labour MPs if they trust the inquiry being carried out into politicians who played a key role in the fraudulent hospitals privatisation deal. Muscat has sought to have the magistrate leading the inquiry, Gabriella Vella, kicked off the case. Last week, Robert Abela echoed Muscat’s criticism of the magistrate and implied the probe might be politically motivated. Most Labour MPs questioned on Monday also expressed concern about the magisterial inquiry, saying it was taking too long. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard and his two predecessors in that role, Edward Zammit Lewis and Owen Bonnici, were among the MPs who spoke most critically of the judicial process. “It’s not acceptable to have such delays,” Attard said, adding that “everyone must assume their responsibilities.”  RELATED STORIES  And while Zammit Lewis said all judicial delays are argued that “justice delayed is justice denied,” Bonnici’s criticism was more full-throated. “It doesn’t help when police carry out a search and members of [NGO] Repubblika are there, taking photos,” the one-time justice minister said, as he also highlighted the inquiry’s four-and-a-half year timespan and repeated Muscat’s criticism about the magistrate’s relatives having criticised the former prime minister on Facebook. “These things do not help to trust in the process,” Bonnici said.

History: Dr Felice Cutajar – ‘Alexander Ball’s Maltese face’,| Michael Galea,"Dr Felice Cutajar has the distinction of being the first Maltese high-serving officer under the British administration in Malta. He lived through a very eventful period of Malta’s history: the end of the reign of the Order of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem in 1798, the two-year turbulent occupation of the island by the French (1798-1800), and the beginning of the British era in 1800.   Born on September 8, 1739, he was baptised the following day at the parish church of Our Lady of Porto Salvo (St Dominic), Valletta. His father, Salvatore Cutajar, was a pharmacist (magister aromatarius) by profession. The young Felice Cutajar studied jurisprudence at the University of Malta, and graduated doctor of law, and obtained a doctorate in both civil and canon law (juris utriusque doctor). He was proficient in Italian, French and English, “a professional man of integrity” and “a matured learned lawyer”.   At the age of 25, Felice Cutajar married Theodora Bonello. From this marriage, three daughters were born: Benedetta, Maria Anna and Clara. All three embraced the monastic life with the nuns of the Jerusalemite Order of St John (commonly known as the nuns of St Ursola) in Valletta. With the advent of Napoleon and his troops in Malta in June 1798, Cutajar sided and sympathised with his compatriots, the Maltese insurgents against the French. He bequeathed to posterity a narrative description of the events and vicissitudes that took place during the two-year French occupation of Malta: Breve storia della venuta delli francesi nell’isola di Malta e loro modo di governarla (National Library of Malta, ms. 619).   Cutajar’s proficiency in languages, his acumen in the legal profession, and his sympathy with the Maltese against the French must have attracted the attention of Captain Alexander John Ball, Civil Commissioner of Malta and president of the island’s provisional government in 1799. Cutajar won Ball’s confidence, leading to his appointment as secretary to Ball, in which capacity he attended the meetings of the Maltese National Congress. There was “an excellent rapport” between the two. Cutajar coordinated the proceedings between Ball and the representatives of the national congress. Meanwhile, Ball was directed by Lord Nelson to proceed in HMS Alexander off Malta “and to use your best endeavours to blockade the ports of that island so as to prevent any supplies getting in them for the French troops, as well as to prevent the escape of the French ships now in that place”. Captain Ball’s ship wintered at anchor off the coast of Malta, out of reach of the guns. During the greater part of the blockade, Ball lived on shore. The French troops, under General Claude Henri Belgrand de Vaubois, pressed by a dearth of provisions and unable to withstand the siege any longer, surrendered on September 4, 1800. The blockade had ended. After the French surrender, gold medals, together with a citation or attestation, were awarded to the Maltese representatives in recognition of their service in the defence of the island. The attestations were signed by Ball and Cutajar, “secretary to his excellency”. Both signed on the same line. Silver medals were also awarded to those recruits in the village battalions who distinguished themselves in sorties against the French.   “Cutajar served through Ball’s initial phase, and afterward in 1802, in the role of pro-segretario on Ball’s return to office. The books of minutes provide evidence of a very considerable workload, and of a man who did his job well.   No less important to the function of the secretariat system was the role played by the pro-segretario, or second secretary, who was the senior ranking Maltese official. The pro-segretario was the man who effectively dealt with most of the business coming to the secretariat from those institutions and departments of government that were staffed by Maltese functionaries. It was partly a matter of language, but also a recognition that in a situation where the legal systems and forms and practices of government were premised on former usages, there was a need of a knowledgeable and sensitive handling of Maltese affairs.   Cutajar was the first pro-segretario in post. This was a new function in Maltese administrative tradition, which he seems to have carried out with notable efficiency. As Patrick Staines says in Essays on Governing Malta 1800-1813, he was Ball’s “Maltese face at the time and probably his closest advisor”. Cutajar’s tenure of office ended abruptly on October 13, 1803, “in unexpected circumstances”. In 1804, Cutajar was re-engaged as one of the administrators of the public property board, “a post of much lower status and emolument”. It was an onerous appointment that involved the difficult transition period of the transfer of public property from the Order of St John to the early British administration. On December 18, 1807, Cutajar retired from the public property board on the grounds of age and infirmity, and he was granted a pension of £60 a year, which Staines notes “was a pittance, considering his earlier service as uditore (advisor) and secretary”.     Cutajar died at his residence in Rabat on July 8, 1815, at the age of 76. He was interred in the crypt of St Paul’s church, fuori le mura, Rabat. His tomb is unmarked, featuring neither his name nor the date of his death, nor by an epitaph. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Malta Eurovision finalists will sing for the cameras this year,Daniel Ellul,"Malta will decide its representative for May’s Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday. But unlike previous years, the Malta Eurovision Song Contest’s 12 finalists will not perform in front of a live theatre audience but at TVM studios.  Televoting and a jury will decide the winner.  “We are focusing more on giving the best experience to television viewers this year,” said Charles Dalli, editor at Public Broadcasting Services.  Holding the contest in Guardamangia’s studios means a better-produced final product for viewers, he said.  Malta Eurovision 2011 contest winner Glenn Vella said a show dedicated to television would likely improve the viewers’ experience. “Still, I think artists will miss performing in front of a live audience. Having an audience makes it more exciting for a performer and I think singers will miss the sound of applause after their song,” the One Life singer said.    Claudette Buttigieg, who won the Malta Eurovision in 2000, had similar feelings.  Her winning song, Desire, is still popular among many in Malta.  “Performers will miss not having an audience. For many, singing live in front of thousands during the Malta Eurovision, was the highlight of their career,” Buttigieg said.  She added that the winner of the Malta contest will have to perform in front of a large audience when they sing at Eurovision.  But Maltese singers now had other opportunities to sing in live audience song contests, Buttigieg added, mentioning the Maltese language festival Mużika Mużika as an example.  Buttigieg, a Nationalist Party MP, shadows broadcasting from the opposition benches.  She is hoping to see “something of very good quality,” adding that PBS should always provide a high-quality product while also considering costs. Another change this year is that each finalist has been given €5,000 to produce a music video. Those videos will be shown on February 1.   This year’s Eurovision will also have an award for best music video. The idea, Dalli explained, is for singers to have something to show after the contest is over, so that more singers will be promoted through the Malta Eurovision. This year’s Malta Eurovision Song Contest will start today with interviews with the 12 finalists running until January 31.   Following the music video night on February 1, the 12 finalists will perform songs from past editions of the Eurovision on February 2, before the finale is held on February 3. The way Malta decides its Eurovision representatives has seen some changes in recent years.  In 2019 and 2021, Michela Pace and Destiny Chukunyere represented Malta on the European stage after winning X-Factor Malta.  The COVID-19 pandemic stopped the 2020 Eurovision from taking place. In 2022 and 2023, the Malta contest returned with Emma Muscat and The Busker winning a live event.  Last year’s live final was very popular with local viewers. The competition’s grand finale saw 265,000 viewers tuning in: more than half Malta’s population.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Today's front pages - January 29, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Monday. Times of Malta reports how a court found that a man accused of involvement in the horrific Paqpaqli car crash seven years ago had 'big fat zero' involvement. It also reports that retailers will shoulder 4.4% of price cuts negotiated with the government. A further 10.6 per cent will be shouldered by importers.  The Malta Independent quotes the Rota cycle advocacy group saying that alternative modes of transport have no change in Infrastructure Malta's approach.  In-Nazzjon leads with Bernard Grech's comments on Sunday, where he said the people are suffering the consequences of Robert Abela's weak leadership. It also reports that Abela is doing what he can to hide Joseph Muscat's name. In a third story it says Mater Dei Hospital is struggling to cope. l-orizzont gives prominence to a commitment by the prime minister for the government to continue to help the people.

Shops to shoulder 4.4% of price cuts,Matthew Xuereb,"All retailers who subscribe to the government’s Stabbiltà initiative must fork out 4.4 per cent of the price reductions, with the rest of the 10.6 per cent shouldered by importers, it has emerged. Prices of up to 400 basic food items will be reduced by 15 per cent from February 1 in a deal, dubbed Stabbiltà (stability), negotiated between the government, importers and retailers, designed to curb inflation. Earlier this month, the government announced that it had struck an agreement with major importers and large supermarkets with annual sales turnover of more than €4 million. The smaller shops and village grocers that do not sell more than €800,000 worth of goods a year, and which do not benefit from economies of scale, are to be given €125 per month by the government to make up for the loss of profits. However, a large segment of retailers who fall in between these two categories were left in the dark on their situation. Several retailers who called the government helpline 153 for information were told that in their case, the 15 per cent price reduction must be shouldered equally by them and the importers – 7.5 per cent each. But in reply to questions from Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the economy ministry said this was not the case and that all retailers would be treated equally. “The information is incorrect. The contract is the same for everyone. The only difference is that those below €800,000 are entitled to a support of €125 per month, while the others are not. “Therefore, to achieve the 15 per cent reduction, it involves a 4.4 point decrease in the retailer’s margin and the remainder covered by the importer. This approach ensures an equitable distribution of the RRP reduction,” the spokesperson said.   Close to 300 importers and retailers, large and small, have so far subscribed to the scheme. They will not receive compensation such as tax rebates or tax credits. Some insiders have said that to make up for potential losses, they will “probably” have to raise the prices of other products. Many have praised the initiative but others, such as the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Enterprise, denounced the scheme as a “price-fixing” measure. Others derided the tactic as nothing short of political manoeuvring and some said it felt like “going back to the 1980s” when the government used to set the price of some grocery items. The Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority has said the scheme is “not anti-competitive”, pointing to similar initiatives in other EU member states such as France, Italy and Greece. Last week, the Malta Employers’ Association said a tax exemption on the cost-of-living allowance (COLA) would have been far more effective in mitigating inflation, resulting in “immediate and direct” extra purchasing power. The price reduction measure covers food items ranging from minced beef and frozen vegetables to tea, coffee and dairy products.

Man with ‘zero involvement’ in Paqpaqli crash cleared after seven years,Edwina Brincat,"A motorsport enthusiast has been cleared of all criminal responsibility for the ill-fated 2015 Paqpaqli għall-Istrina charity event, with the court declaring the man’s involvement “a big fat zero” seven years after he was charged. “I had nothing to do with it. I was never in the core committee… I got to know some of the other co-accused here in court,” Jonathan Tonna told the court, adding he had initially thought the charges were “some joke”. He was one of the five co-accused, of the original group of 13, still facing charges over the incident in which motoring enthusiast Paul Bailey’s Porsche 918 Spyder spun out of control and crashed into the crowd. About 26 spectators were injured, some critically. The following year, members of the organising committee, together with the supercar driver, were charged with involuntary harm to victims and damage to third party property following a magisterial inquiry into the incident. They were also sued before the civil courts for damages. Criminal proceedings were assigned to Magistrate Victor George Axiak after former Magistrate Aaron Bugeja was elevated to judge. Last October, Bailey registered an admission and was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service. One of the organisers, Angelo Manara, also registered an admission and was ordered to perform 200 hours of community work. Two months later, another six members of the core committee pleaded guilty and each was handed 200 hours of community service, plus one-thirteenth share in court expenses.   Tonna was involved in the annual charity event up to 2013 representing Island Cars Club, which used to organise its own motoring event at another site. The club last participated in Paqpaqli in 2014. The following year the club decided not to hold the event because there were too few entries. In 2015, Tonna received an email from one of the Paqpaqli organisers, Tonio Cini, asking whether Island Cars Club had a safety plan when organising their own event. “What safety plan?” Tonna replied, explaining that pre-2015 there was no plan. When Paqpaqli was first organised during the presidency of George Abela, safety was handled by his colleague Duncan Barbaro Sant, who gave instructions regarding track design, barriers and how the area was to be fenced off. But after both of them stepped down, Tonna had no further involvement. “That’s where it ended. I’ve been here for seven years and they know it.” He got to know about the Paqpaqli incident through a relative who worked in hospital and who alerted Tonna’s wife about the casualties being rushed to emergency. Months later, then-inspector Josric Mifsud asked Tonna whether he would assist in the magisterial inquiry as court expert. Tonna expressed doubts about his personal qualifications but Mifsud assured him that as a motorsports enthusiast who had organised several motoring events, he was sufficiently experienced to qualify as court expert. Tonna turned down the proposal, sensing a conflict of interest. One of his relatives had been badly injured in the crash and he also knew some of those involved in the event’s organisation. He gave the police officer contact details of a foreign motorsports enthusiast who could provide the necessary expertise. Then two weeks later, he received a call. “The magistrate wants to speak to you,” the caller said. “I thought it was some joke,” Tonna said on the witness stand. He could not answer the inquiring magistrate’s questions because “I had nothing to do with it”. He was questioned about the “previous years” and once the session was over, he headed back home. In 2017, one of the event organizers dropped the bombshell, telling Tonna that he had been named in the case. “Perhaps they have mistaken experts,” he wondered. But he called Mifsud to check, and “he [the police officer] did not seem to know what to say”.   Then court documents began to pour in. “There were 13 civil cases…€14,000 in court expenses,” explained Tonna. The court saga also impacted his wife’s well-being. “I had nothing to do with it. I was never in the core committee,” he insisted when questioned twice by the magistrate. Barbaro Sant also testified that Tonna, together with the majority of the organising team, had stepped down in 2013. After stepping down, Barbaro Sant did not hand over his safety role to anyone and could not tell who took over. Following those testimonies, Magistrate Axiak turned to the prosecution: “Do you still want to press charges against Tonna?” Superintendent Josric Mifsud said that if the other co-accused declared they could not point a finger at Tonna, the prosecution would take a stand. He confirmed he had called Tonna. “Seven years have passed in this case but it’s never too late,” the court observed. “Tonna’s involvement was nil, nothing, a big fat zero. Can we have this declaration today so that this man may reset?” Lawyers for Jonathan Bruno, Agostino Degiorgio, Tonio Cini and Brian Gatt unanimously minuted that Tonna had no involvement whatsoever in the organisation of the 2015 event. The prosecution then requested the separation of proceedings and the court delivered judgment in respect of Tonna, declaring that he “clearly had no involvement of whatever nature in the organisation of the event and had no responsibility for any safety plan”. The court cleared Tonna of all criminal liability. “You may now leave,” said the magistrate, as Tonna left the dock and walked out of the courtroom, visibly relieved. The case continues. Lawyers Michael Sciriha, Lucio Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri were defence counsel to Tonna, Bruno and Cini. Lawyer Raphael Fenech Adami is counsel to Degiorgio. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli are counsel to Gatt. Lawyer Michael Grech appeared parte civile. Superintendent Mifsud and Inspector Hubert Cini are prosecuting.

"Villa Guardamangia ‘still a shambles’, restoration will take at least five years",Fiona Galea Debono,"A repeated reference to the late Queen Elizabeth II’s happy Malta home in the final season of The Crown may have aroused global interest in Villa Guardamangia but it will not be opening to the public as a tourist attraction any time soon. The home of Britain’s then Princess Elizabeth between 1949 and 1951 will remain a “war zone for quite some time, because the needs are extensive”, said Heritage Malta COO Kenneth Gambin. He estimated that its restoration would take “at least another five years” – almost a decade after the national agency was entrusted with the project.   But although the prestigious, albeit crumbling, property looks much like it did five years ago, when the government bought it, intensive behind-the-scenes work has meant EU funding can finally be applied for, further discoveries have been made – and even more damage borne. The application for co-financing will be submitted by March, but Heritage Malta is not losing any time. Works are under way and the money – at least €10 million – will be recouped later. Next month, parts of neighbouring properties, overlooking the iconic garden of the Grade 2 listed Guardamangia Hill monument, will be demolished at Heritage Malta’s expense, following agreement with their owners – because even the surrounding context counts. Meanwhile, the situation inside was so bad and the building so fragile that damage was sustained even after Heritage Malta walked into the rundown former royal dwelling, Gambin said.   Water still seeps into the villa, so the ceilings were patched up – but they need to be replaced; while the garden walls were recently rebuilt after they collapsed when storm Helios dealt its heavy blow last February. “We have done all the first aid required to keep it standing and now it is improving,” Gambin said, underlining the importance of the preparatory phase. “The place is still in a shambles, but it was worse, I can assure you. It may be difficult to believe…” he said, pointing to the parts that have been propped up. Tons of inert waste and rubbish have been cleared, including the costly removal of asbestos. The excavation of a corner of the garden unearthed bits of the stone statues used to embellish it; tiles have been removed to be fixed, cleaned and returned; while extensive underground shelters, around three storeys deep, were emptied of the copious amount of rubble that filled them. Off-site, documentation and research, bills of quantities and architectural surveys have been compiled, so once the application is processed and approved, the ball will get rolling immediately.  Next month, parts of neighbouring properties, overlooking the iconic garden of the Grade 2 listed Guardamangia Hill monument, will be demolished at Heritage Malta’s expense.   The groundwork, a major task in itself, was ready; the walls have spoken, and information has been gleaned from interviews with people who lived and worked in the villa, as well as from local and foreign archives – although the architect of the property, a classic baroque example of an 18th-century Maltese country summer house, has not yet been discovered. “We can now confidently say that we know what we are going to do, but only now,” Gambin emphasised. “It was not a matter of just walking in and starting. We have gathered much precious information on how to restore the building. “Everybody is impatient, but in such properties, which have such a long history, before intervening, you have to know how, and that requires lots of research from scratch,” Gambin said.   “All we knew when the property was bought was that Prince Philip and Princess Elizabeth lived here on and off for around two years (when the Duke of Edinburgh was a naval officer stationed on the island). That was it! “But in reality, the history of the building is much more than that, going back to at least the mid-18th century.” Heritage Malta is taking a historic house approach to the restoration, focusing on the mid-20th century, while making sure not to cover up all the other layers of history and leave enough information to be read, interpreted and enjoyed.   Wall paintings, whitewashed under the instructions of Prince Philip’s uncle Lord Mountbatten, are being uncovered and restored, only to be covered again, leaving some areas exposed to explain the history of the building. Heritage Malta is also working to get its hands on furniture that is known from inventories to have been in the house and is now privately owned – “if they are decently priced”, Gambin said.   “The villa is important for other reasons, but the last episode of the royal couple residing here was the cherry on the cake.” The only place outside the UK that Queen Elizabeth II lived in is a testimony to her “normal” life, and walking through her former bedroom, bathroom and walk-in wardrobe emphasises the point. Name-checked in an emotional and nostalgic penultimate episode of The Crown’s sixth season, Hope Street, the queen tells grandson Prince William he need not accompany her at her Golden Jubilee celebrations at a time when he has just met future wife Kate Middleton and should be leading as normal a life as possible. She then goes on to describe her stay in Malta with Prince Philip, as a young married couple, before she acceded to the throne in 1953, describing living in their home outside Valletta as “some of the happiest years of my life”. Then a young naval wife, her character describes how she went grocery shopping and got her hair done locally.   Later in the episode, the queen sends Prince William a framed photo of her and Prince Philip in Malta to her grandson’s new home at university with Kate, with a note saying: “I hope it can be your ‘Villa Guardamagia’.” In real life, she too had been presented with paintings of No. 49 by Maltese dignitaries. According to Forbes Business, in 2020, The Crown ‒ the “streamer’s biggest awards juggernaut” ‒ had already been watched by 73 million households worldwide since its 2016 debut. Interest in the series spiked after the monarch’s death in September 2022. Gambin is used to the interest in Villa Guardamangia, saying the decrepit building did not need any publicity and received daily knocks on its door from people from all over the world. He acknowledged, however, that its mention in a positive – “accurate and true” – light will also “increase expectations, which we happily accept”.   The most important aspect of the princess’s stay in Malta was the human element, Gambin stressed. “This is not Buckingham Palace, and it never was, and that is why she enjoyed it. It is as simple as that.” Undoubtedly, the queen’s former home will be a strong crowd-puller. It comes with high – and justified – expectations, maintained the COO of Heritage Malta, which is prepared for this and used to challenges of such magnitude. “It will take some time and money, inevitably. But we will get there,” Gambin said. And possibly, on inauguration day, when it finally opens, the reigning monarch will get there too.

People are suffering the consequences of Abela's weak leadership - PN leader,Giulia Magri,"Robert Abela's weak leadership of the Labour Party was causing weak leadership of the country, and the people were suffering the consequences, including mounting problems in the health and transport sectors and inflation, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday. Speaking during campaigning in Gozo, Grech was quoted as saying in a party statement that the Labour Party had been hijacked, and Abela was showing himself to be weak. He had also lost his moral authority.  His comments came at the prime minister indicated a readiness to bring back several figures who were excluded from the government while making it clear that he would not stand in Joseph Muscat’s way if the former prime minister decided to contest the elections for the European Parliament.   Grech, who visited various localities in Gozo, said the PN was committed to generating wealth and solving the people's problems.

"Gozo ‘thriving with environmental crimes,’ ranger unit says",James Cummings,"The Malta Ranger Unit has described Gozo as “thriving with environmental crimes” in a social media post highlighting a lack of law enforcement on the island. Pointing out that Gozo remains without an environmental protection unit (EPU), the NGO said on Facebook that the lack of police presence “means environmental criminals enjoy 100% impunity.” The Malta Ranger Unit (MRU) said it was regularly travelling to the island to monitor environmental crimes and this weekend had dispatched a “full team” to monitor illegal construction on the island. Stressing that the statistics for environmental illegalities in Gozo didn't reflect the reality on the ground, the NGO said it would be requesting a meeting with Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri on the issue.   The MRU is a voluntary organisation which monitors environmental crimes across the country. Its officers regularly patrol in both Malta and Gozo both in uniform and undercover and it also offers advice to the public through a 24-hour helpline.  Speaking to Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the organisation said many of the suspected illegal constructions it saw in Gozo started out as small sheds but would often grow to include more rooms and even an extra floor. Commenting on the low numbers of reported illegalities seen in official statistics, the spokesperson said the figures didn’t make sense. “We go from illegality to illegality to illegality, so it cannot be a place where these things aren’t happening,” she said, pointing to the low figures of hunting-related offences seen in official reports. According to a report from Gozo’s Wild Birds Regulation Unit, there were no offences detected during last year’s Spring hunting season.   Describing the island as “very hard to enforce,” she said MRU had been informed that some Gozo residents were afraid to speak out for fear of retribution owing to them often living in small communities on the island. However, the spokesperson stressed that the organisation was “seeing a big change in mentality,” with increasing numbers of the public approaching the group for advice about how to minimise their impact while engaging in outdoor activities such as camping. She emphasised the group’s call for greater enforcement and for a police environmental unit to be based in Gozo. In September, fellow conservation NGO BirdLife Malta said the number of police officers monitoring the autumn hunting season had been reduced while illegalities were ""revving up"". Echoing MRU concerns, the group called environmental units in Gozo “non-existent, with most of the police force expected to be taken up with school traffic during morning hours.""

Government is focused on improving people’s lives - Abela,Times of Malta,"The government is united and focused on improving people’s lives, Prime Minister Robert Abela insisted on Sunday. Addressing hundreds who attended an open day at the party’s headquarters in Hamrun, Abela spoke about how the Labour Party had given people its word and had followed it through. “We gave our word that this will be a strong year for our country and that's how it is,” he said as he referred to several projects that were completed in the first weeks of the year and initiatives that came into force. “The government is working every day, every moment, so that our country, our people, find the government supporting them. Where there are those who try to put down our initiatives, we find hope,"" he said.   The government, he said, is focused on strong initiatives including the third social pact that will come into force next week and which will offer stability in the price of 400 food products. ""The administration which I lead has not let the people on their own,"" Abela said. Economists predict that food prices will keep rising. With dialogue and conviction, we have brought about peace of mind,"" Abela said, adding that it was through the will and courage to change things for the better that this was achieved. He warned about people would try to dampen the effectiveness of this initiative but the truth was that the government cared about what the people felt.   Against a backdrop of an exhibition about the history of the Malta Labour Party, Abela said it was the party that brought about the biggest changes, especially in the social sphere. “No one would have thought that the government would give families a grant to help them raise their children, but it was done and was repeatedly increased. The same with pensions. When they were introduced, many said it was not possible, but they were introduced and increased again this year,” Abela said. The prime minister stressed how the Labor Party must remain an agent of change. ""We want to be the change. That’s how we are trusted. Because we work for people. Because this is a party in government that is full of ideas, full of energy and full of love for the country,” he said.

Labour MEP candidates file judicial protest calling on PN to file its accounts,Times of Malta,"Two Labour candidates for the European Parliament elections have filed a judicial protest calling on the Nationalist Party to submit its accounts and list of donors to the Electoral Commission as required by the party financing law.  RELATED STORIES  Daniel Attard and Maria Sara Vella Gafà pointed out in their protest that the PN had not published its accounts for 2021 and 2022 and was therefore liable for a fine of up to €20,000 for each plus another fine for its failure to declare its donors   They accused the PN of demonstrating a sense of impunity and ignoring the legal requirements without a valid reason. They therefore also called on the Electoral Commission to take whatever action was required by law to make the PN conform to the law and to fine it accordingly.

"Labour enjoying 10.8% lead over the PN, survey shows",Times of Malta,"Should a general election be held tomorrow, the Labour Party would win with a lead of 10.8% over the Nationalist Party, statistician Vincent Marmara said on Sunday following his latest survey. He said in a Facebook post that the Labour Party is enjoying the support of 53% of voters while 42.2% would choose the PN. 4.8% would opt for other political parties. The survey was held between January 20 and 26 - before reports that Joseph Muscat could contest the European Parliament elections. It involved a sample of 1,000 people.  He said the figures showed a shift of 1.7% from the PL to the PN since the last general election, but were an election to be held tomorrow, a substantial number of people were saying they would not vote, and turnout would be a low of 71%. Still, the gap between the major political parties would be some 27,000 in favour of the PL, comfortable for the ruling party but well below what it achieved at the last general election.  The survey results also show that Labour leader and Prime Minister Robert Abela is trusted by 20.9% more than PN leader Bernard Grech. Survey participants were asked who they preferred to be prime minister. 44.2% opted for Abela and 23.3% for Grech. 10.8% said they did not trust anyone, 12.9% did not know and 8.8% said they trusted somebody else. The leaders of both political parties made small gains, although Abela gained more than Grech.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

New cardiology consultants soon to be appointed as patients boom,Fiona Galea Debono,"New cardiology consultants, specifically for the care of heart failure patients, will soon be appointed to meet the demands of an ever-growing population, as the hospital numbers seen at its dedicated clinics have increased “incredibly” over the past years. In 2023, more than 4,300 patients attended Mater Dei’s Heart Failure Clinics, ranging in age between 21 and 94, with a median age of 69, the Department of Cardiology said. In 2017, just over 2,600 patients were seen.  RELATED STORIES  The authorities are emphasising the importance of strengthening primary care. To this aim, the new Paola Hub Heart Failure Clinic will be an off-site extension, aimed at treating patients in the community, said Cardiology Department chairperson Robert Xuereb. “Undoubtedly, the imminent opening of the Paola Hub, together with other health centres, should improve this rate,” he said. Meanwhile, Xuereb is confident the clinics had everything in line to fulfil their criteria to achieve the title of a Heart Failure Centre of Excellence. These centres were in the process of being set up across Europe by the Heart Failure Association, a branch of the European Society of Cardiology. Together with consultant cardiologist Caroline Magri and cardiology specialist Alice May Moore, they were reacting to a recent study that warned heart failure would almost double by 2040 under current prevention and treatment trends. Described as the first nationwide analysis on the follow-up of heart failure patients, it also pointed to inappropriate testing for treatment and lack of follow-up in the form of baseline blood tests, mostly under the care of non-cardiologists. Carried out by Anthony Cutajar, an advanced pharmacist practitioner with the Health Ministry, the study showed how fast heart disease was progressing locally and that not all patients had access to guideline-directed medical therapy. But the Cardiology Department expressed major concern about his thesis, saying the data, based on the decade between 2007 and 2017, was “outdated” and “not a true picture” of the current care given to heart failure patients at hospital. The department had undergone important changes and “the vast majority of patients are receiving optimum care”, the cardiologists said, referring to the introduction of the dedicated clinics in January 2018. These included the Specialist Led Heart Failure Clinic, the Cardio-Oncology Clinic and the Heart Transplant Clinic. Since then, more patients have been referred to specialists, which meant their investigation and treatment has “dramatically improved and is now being implemented according to the latest international guidelines”. This included follow-up, supported by the necessary investigations, such as echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, the cardiologists said. The care provided to heart failure patients was according to the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the doctors said, pouring cold water on the study and pointing out the introduction of new modes of investigation and interventional forms of treatment. The department has also set up a collaboration with the Istituto Mediterraneo per I Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT) to offer a heart transplant service. Replying to the study’s concern that additional therapy from the last two years – another two classes of drugs – was not on offer on the national formulary and unaffordable for a large group of heart failure patients, the department said it was working on introducing these medications for free. One of these was also used for the treatment of diabetes and was currently on the national formulary for patients suffering from this disease. Since the vast majority of heart failure patients had diabetes, many were benefitting from these pills free of charge anyway, the cardiologists explained. Patients not entitled to this were still advised to buy them if clinically indicated, they advised. Doubts raised in the study on the right life-saving medication being prescribed adequately were also quashed by the cardiologists. They clarified that 44 per cent of patients attending the clinic were on all four pillars of treatment outlined in the international standards for heart failure, while 33 per cent were taking three. It added, however, that all classes of anti-failure medication had important side effects and not all patients could tolerate them, particularly in the case of drops in blood pressure in the elderly and frail. Malta’s sixth highest ranking for rate of avoidable hospitalisations – for a combination of heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes – “reflects the need to strengthen primary health care,” the cardiologists agreed. But the State of Health in the EU Malta Country Health Profile 2023 document, from where this statistic was derived, also stated that Malta’s life expectancy at birth was 82.7 in 2022, two years above the EU average, they pointed out. “Life expectancy here is among the highest in the EU. We rank fifth in the latest Eurostat database. This is primarily due to a reduction in premature deaths from cardiovascular diseases,” the cardiologists highlighted. Heart failure was, nevertheless, becoming more common in Malta due to a combination of improved survival after heart attacks, a growing elderly population and an increasing prevalence of risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. “We are facing increasingly frail elderly patients with many other concomitant illnesses, who have to be managed in a holistic and patient-centred manner, by a multidisciplinary team, including geriatricians, diabetologists, nephrologists and other specialists,” the cardiologists said.

"Today's front pages - January 28, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Sunday. The Sunday Times of Malta reports that the majority of the members of the Cabinet would welcome a political comeback by Joseph Muscat. The former prime minister is reportedly considering a bid for election to the European Parliament, where he started his political life.  The newspaper also reports that an investigation by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office into the Marsa junction project has recently zeroed in on former Infrastructure Malta chief Fredrick Azzopardi. MaltaToday reports that according to the police, nuns behind child abuse allegations in a Gozo home cannot be charged.  It also reports that PN insiders have cautioned party leader Bernard Grech to moderate a misinformed stand on the reform of the drugs laws. The Malta Independent, meanwhile, quotes the director of Caritas saying the proposed drugs reform would 'ease' the minds of traffickers. The newspaper also features an MP's complaints that nothing regulates massage parlours.  It-Torċa says the Labour Party started the year stronger. According to its survey, it enjoys the support of 53% compared to 42.2% for the PN. According to Il-Mument, Robert Abela is a prisoner of Joseph Muscat and has lost control over the Labour Party.  Illum says there is euphoria within Labour about Joseph Muscat's expected return to politics, but moderates are angry. It also reports that Labour's parliamentary group is to discuss allowing Rosianne Cutajar to return to the group. KullĦadd quotes the prime minister saying the June European Parliament elections are a choice between a progressive economy or austerity.

An online scammer offered me a job… and I accepted,Neville Borg,"“Hello, my name is Caroline and I am a recruitment agent from Archer IT Recruitment Malta. We are looking for a variety of part-time/full-time positions as these are online remote jobs”. The WhatsApp message landed out of the blue on Monday afternoon, sent from what I later discovered to be an Indonesian telephone number. Caroline was promising me the opportunity to earn thousands for as little as an hour’s work each day. All I needed was a computer and a “bankcard for salary payments”. I immediately clocked that it was a scam but decided to play along.   Caroline told me that her “line manager” would be contacting me with more information about the job. I promptly received identical messages from two different British phone numbers saying that Caroline had told them that I was looking for a job. I replied to both. One of the lines went silent but the other proceeded to describe the job as “online freelancing” that would allow me to work “anywhere and anytime” without impacting my current job. My role, I was told, would be to “optimize the data as a user”, a gibberish description that was never really clarified despite my asking about it several times throughout our conversation.   I was told I would need to log on to a platform that “randomly pops up items on it, and our job is to click and submit items that pop up”, leading to “high visibility” in Amazon and German retail giants OTTO. This turned out to mean that I’d be submitted an endless stream of five-star reviews for random products on these websites, from shoes to screwdrivers, handbags to hairdryers. I would be working for a company called Rebellion Marketing, they said. A quick Google search revealed that this is the name of a reputable marketing company based in Portsmouth, UK. I asked for more information about Rebellion Marketing, hoping to learn more about my future employers. Minutes later, I was sent the company’s legal registration documents, presumably to persuade me that I was joining a legitimate business. In reality, these documents are freely accessible to anyone through the UK's business registry. Eventually, my interlocutor revealed that her name was Helen and that she had been assigned to be my trainer and to ease me into the job. Helen told me that I’d be paid in USDT, a cryptocurrency stablecoin that is pegged to the US Dollar. “It’s as safe as your bank account”, she said, reassuringly. She launched into a confusing description of what I’d earn, with a seemingly stable salary topped up with various bonuses depending on how many tasks I completed. In brief, I could earn 5,500 USDT (a little over €5,000) in a month, together with additional “daily commission”, I was told. “Will I have a contract?”, I asked timidly. It would automatically be signed when I opened my account, Helen said, no need for these petty worries. What about tax? Would I be taxed in Malta or in the UK? “No, please don't worry because the company has already done it for you!” Helen exclaimed. With my lucrative tax-free job lined up, I was finally ready for my induction. Helen directed me towards the platform, at a website called rebellionwork.com, asking me to register an account. I duly obliged. It quickly transpired that the scammers didn’t just borrow Rebellion Marketing’s, they also stole the company's photos, videos and logos to make their operation appear genuine.   What followed was a convoluted verification process with a back-and-forth of access codes and screenshots involving an AI-driven “customer service” bot. My account was finally set up but, by this time, over two hours had elapsed and my real-life job was calling.   “I’m afraid I have to go soon”, I said. Could we continue the training tomorrow? Helen begrudgingly agreed. I soon found out that Helen wasn’t pleased with the delay. “I doubt you'll be able to do this job, because you seem to be busy all the time”, she snapped the following morning. “I have time now”, I pleaded, fearing that I was about to be fired from a job I had yet to start. Helen relented. I was guided back to the platform to start my training through Helen’s terse instructions, punctured by the occasional overly-excited claim about how I could earn (“My account was upgraded to VIP2, and because I deposited 1000USDT the platform rewarded me with 60USDT!”). My training involved submitting 45 “optimisations” (or online reviews) and heading back to the AI customer care chatbot to verify a series of fake transactions.   I thought I’d spice up this tedious task with some small talk. “If we’re going to work together I’d like to get to know you a little more”, I told Helen. A long pause followed.     “I’m in England. I run my own little coffee shop”, Helen eventually replied. “If you ever come to London, I’ll buy you a coffee”. “I think I make very good coffee” she added with a hint of pride. It turns out that I am, in fact, planning a trip to London. Where could I find her once I’m there? “I live near Buckingham Palace in London”. After we established that her coffee shop had never been visited by members of the royal family (“I’m just a regular guy”, Helen said, rather confusingly), we decided that it was time to get back to business. I had finished my tasks, now it was time to cash in. Helen told me that I needed to open a crypto exchange account, suggesting either Binance or Bybit as good options. While I proceeded to open my account, Helen told me more about how I’d be paid. I’d need to complete two tasks (or two sets of “optimisations”) each day for five consecutive days to receive my rewards and I would be able to withdraw my earnings as soon as I’m done. Once my crypto account was set up, Helen began sending step-by-step instructions, eventually leading me to the exchange’s deposit page and telling me to click on the deposit button to submit the funds I needed to access my earnings. I hesitated. “Why am I depositing money?”, I asked. This is to “ensure that the data is optimised for truthfulness”, came the baffling reply. But I wasn’t to worry, “the funds are returned to our account when we complete a task”, Helen said, “I promise you on my life”. It’s here that our communication went cold. Helen, presumably frustrated at having come so far, grew tired of my hesitation. My supposed earnings would have to remain unclaimed, my possible career as a data optimiser cut short. Data optimisation scams are believed to be among the largest growing types of fraud, first emerging in late 2022 but coming to the fore in the Spring of last year, with one Euronews report estimating that over 1,000 people in the UK now receive these scam job offers each day. These scams often lure victims into believing that they are on to a good thing by allowing them to withdraw small amounts of their earnings before demanding they pay ever-larger amounts to access their funds. Having invested so much time and money into the process, victims often relent, hoping that they will recover their losses with one more payment. This, of course, never happens, and victims are unlikely to ever see their money again. Both companies named in this particular scam confirmed that they have nothing to do with the scam when contacted by Times of Malta. Paris Michailos, Archer IT Recruitment general manager, said that they first became aware of the scam at the beginning of the week, when a client contacted them to ask whether the WhatsApp message they had received was genuine. ""We promptly informed our candidates through our official website, cautioning them about the situation, and simultaneously reported the incident to local authorities."" The company ""would never initiate contact with our candidates or clients through WhatsApp for job offers"", he added. Rebellion Marketing director Jade Arnell, on the other hand, had no idea that her company’s name and image was being used fraudulently. “I’m so shocked that this is going on”, Arnell told Times of Malta. “We have reported the incident to the police and will be working with action fraud to hopefully take down the scammers”. In a video posted to her Facebook page later in the day, Arnell said that they had since been contacted by “several people” who were scammed out of “significant sums of money”.   Despite this, Arnell was informed by Action Fraud UK, the UK’s reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, that while this is a case of identity theft, it is not classified as a “police recorded crime” and that they would be taking no further action unless somebody who has lost money through the scheme comes forward.

Marsa junction probe zeroes in on Fredrick Azzopardi,Jacob Borg,"An investigation into the Marsa junction project has recently zeroed in on former Infrastructure Malta chief Fredrick Azzopardi.   Sources close to the probe said the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) is seeking to establish whether Azzopardi received money from murder suspect Yorgen Fenech or anyone else linked to the €40 million flyover project.   Azzopardi strongly denies any suggestion of wrongdoing.  The probe – according to sources – stepped up a notch this week, as banks, financial institutions, tax authorities and other entities were given 24 hours to list Azzopardi’s assets, valuables, safe deposit boxes, documents and correspondence and relay the information to the European prosecutor.    Azzopardi is being investigated for potential crimes ranging from fraud affecting EU financial interests, misappropriation of EU money, receiving or offering a bribe, and aiding and abetting such crimes. In October 2022, Times of Malta revealed that the EPPO was probing the EU-funded project due to corruption suspicions. Turkish contractor Ayhanlar, who won the project, had promised Fenech a €2 million success fee in exchange for using his contacts to help the failing company secure the Marsa tender. Police have been aware of potential corruption in the project since the seizure of Fenech’s mobile phone in November 2019, when he was arrested and charged in connection with journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination.  Sources familiar with the police ‘file’ opened on the case four years ago say investigators did very little to move it forward, despite suspicions that Fenech’s political connections could have been used to ensure Ayhanlar won the contract.  RELATED STORIES  EPPO’s investigation has registered similarly slow progress, with one source suggesting that the recent focus on Azzopardi would likely amount to little more than a box-ticking exercise, as a sweep of his bank accounts was unlikely to reveal anything.  When contacted, Azzopardi vehemently denied wrongdoing, saying he was not even involved in the selection process for the project.  The former Infrastructure Malta boss was a close aide to Foreign Minister Ian Borg, who served as Infrastructure Minister during the Marsa project. A January 2019 e-mail about the project hinted at potential foul play about the way the tender was awarded.   RELATED STORIES  Sources said that EPPO had only recently retrieved certain e-mail exchanges between Fenech and Turkish billionaire Robert Yildirim.  Yildirim was brought in to complete the project, after the original bidder Ayhanlar crashed out of the tender due to financial difficulties.  After Fenech threatened legal action over the failure to pay the €2 million success fee, Yildirim hit back with a threat of his own.  “We can be on the front pages of newspapers in Malta. Apparently, you might like it. What will you tell the court? Bribing someone but no payment. We didn’t say we don’t pay you. We need to renegotiate all terms and conditions. That’s all! It’s up to you!”, Yildirim said in response to Fenech’s threat.  Yildirim and Fenech deny wrongdoing.  Azzopardi told Times of Malta when contacted that to date, he has not been informed of any ongoing investigation or other similar actions about them.  “I also confirm that I have never been questioned about them by any authority or other entity.  “However, if any such investigations are under way, I welcome them, and I am available to provide all necessary information, documentation and assistance in any such inquiries, as I have always done in the past. I have nothing to hide,” Azzopardi said.  He also denied claims that he ever discussed payments for the project with Fenech.  Activist Arnold Cassola has published WhatsApp messages in which Fenech asked: “x’tixtieq minn dik?” (what would you like from that?) to which Azzopardi replies “circa 45% of 11m”. Azzopardi said the conversation was not even related to the Marsa Junction Project or to any payment, but to the appropriate verification of a technical reference for a completely different project. “The conversation quoted out of context has nothing to do with any irregularity,” said Azzopardi, who headed several entities under a Labour government.

Majority of cabinet say they would welcome Joseph Muscat's return,Herman Grech,"The majority of cabinet members say they support Joseph Muscat as a candidate for the European elections or would publicly support him, as the former prime minister mulls a political return. Fifteen of the 26 cabinet ministers and parliamentary secretaries contacted by Times of Malta over the last two days confirmed they would welcome Muscat as a candidate if he decided to make a bid for the European Parliament in the June election. Not a single cabinet member expressed any disapproval for Muscat returning on the Labour ticket. “Whichever way you look at it, this is Joseph’s victory,” said one Labour parliamentarian.   Sources said a recent internal poll suggested Muscat’s candidacy would sway thousands of traditional PL supporters who claimed they would not vote.  RELATED STORIES  But while acknowledging Muscat’s return could boost the party, MPs are aware it could land the PL in hot water, as an impending magisterial inquiry could lead to criminal action against the former prime minister. Muscat was propelled back into the political limelight on Thursday after Labour pundit Manuel Cuschieri called for his return as an MEP candidate. That call sparked overwhelming support among hardcore supporters, with Muscat later confirming he was mulling a bid. Meanwhile, Robert Abela made it clear he will not stand in Muscat’s way. If he forges ahead, it would be the return of a political heavyweight who fell from glory in 2019 during the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder probe and who has been dogged by claims of corruption since.    MPs who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity clarified that the party’s welcome should not be unconditional, especially if evidence of wrongdoing emerged against Muscat. But, as things stand, “the pluses would outweigh the minuses”, another said. Labour MPs and delegates are well aware that the return of Muscat could undermine Abela, who succeeded him in 2020, and potentially deepen the cracks within the party. “It would weaken Abela in a big way. But in reality, a lot of delegates are disappointed with the prime minister and crave Muscat. For a lot of them, he represents ‘l-aqwa żmien’ (the best of times), a nostalgic period when they felt they were doing really well.” Another cabinet member said: “I’m not sure Abela should welcome him back. I’d rather win the election with 15,000 votes without Muscat, than win it with 50,000 and be forced to defend him in whatever controversy could erupt.” Still, he said he would personally still welcome and support Muscat if he decided to run for election.   Another said he would have no objection to a Muscat candidature as long as Abela was comfortable with it, but admitted the issue is complicated. “While it may be politically expedient to allow him back, I don’t want Abela to suffer political consequences down the line,” he said. “We could find ourselves in a situation with two leader figures in the party, and that could create conflicts that would harm Abela. I speak like this because Muscat is my friend and I respect him, but ultimately Abela is my boss and I’m loyal to him.” Of the remaining 11 ministers and parliamentary secretaries, six refused to comment, one could not see a “plausible” Muscat candidature, and another said it was not his decision to make. Three cabinet members could not be reached for comment. Sentiments could, however, change especially as a magisterial inquiry into Muscat’s dealings looms with weeks ticking to the election. “And the inquiry’s not looking too good for Muscat,” said one source, referring to an investigation where the former prime minister is suspected of receiving kickbacks in connection with the hospitals’ privatisation deal. One party official compared the development as Malta’s very own Donald Trump moment. The former US president will be making another bid for the White House despite facing multiple charges in court. “If they come for you, you go for them.” Clearly, Muscat is in charge of his own fate. One source said: “For the time being he might be keeping his options open. All he needs to do is push the button. He’s too popular among Labour supporters and even cabinet members. At this stage, it’s all about leverage and rallying the troops.”   While the PL was expected to get the majority of votes in June’s elections, MPs and officials have spoken about a party in labour, with different factions threatening to split the party which has been in government for almost 11 years. “Despite his sins, at least you know where you stand with Muscat. With Abela, the disgruntled among us have become even more disgruntled. Everyone’s building sandbags and installing barbed wire.” Contacted for a reaction, former prime minister and now MEP Alfred Sant would not comment. On the other hand, former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar was keen to endorse Muscat. “I agree [that he should run for MEP] and I support him, no doubt. The party and the country needs him,” she said. But a Muscat bid and election could also potentially pit the Labour Party against the European Socialists (PES), EU experts have warned. This comes especially after last October the PES suspended the membership of Smer and Hlas after the two Slovakian parties decided to enter into a coalition with a far-right party. With polls showing PES candidates trailing across Europe, the last thing the Socialists need is a notorious candidate representing them, one expert said. “Muscat is no longer welcome in the PES and his candidature and probable election could even potentially lead to the PL’s exclusion.” Questions sent to PES leader Iratxe García Pérez and EU Parliament vice president Katarina Barley, who is also an S&D MEP, remained unanswered by the time of writing. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola did not comment about the potential bid. Instead, when contacted, a spokesperson sent a copy of the infamous 2019 photo showing Metsola refusing to shake Muscat’s hand.

From the Bench: A failed attempt to commit a crime,| Jacob Magri,"The law criminalises and punishes not only those who commit a criminal offence but also anyone who tries but fails to commit a completed offence. This is called an ‘attempted crime’. The principal feature of an attempted offence is that it is committed even though the substantive offence is not completed. The criminal attempt consists of actions (or omissions) falling short of the completed crime - actions where the offender must have wanted the crime to be committed, got relatively close to actually committing it, yet ultimately failed to do so ‘owing to some accidental cause independent of his will’ – as the law itself holds under Article 41 of the Criminal Code. If a man, intending to kill another man, shoots at his target but misses because he did not aim properly, there is obviously no murder; yet criminal liability exists since the miss was not intentional but was rather an outcome the offender did not desire. If, on the other hand, the miss was voluntary – a notion referred to as ‘voluntary desistance’ – the offender is not guilty of ‘attempted murder’. In such instances, the offender is limitedly responsible for the acts he might have committed prior to voluntarily desisting from completing the crime, provided such acts amount to a criminal offence in the first place. In the judgment The Police vs Owen John Carabott, delivered on January 11, 2024, the Court of Criminal Appeal delved into the constituent elements of attempted crime. At first instance, the appellant was found guilty of attempted aggravated theft and condemned to six-months effective imprisonment. The victim, an elderly woman, had reported to the police that a stranger, who later turned out to be the appellant, repeatedly knocked at her residence and asked her for money. The victim, who on the day was expecting a visit from her nephew, had opened the front door only to be met by a complete stranger who claimed that he was collecting money for charity. Frightened, the victim tried her best to shut the door but the offender managed to stick his foot, preventing the victim from shutting it. Eventually the victim still managed to close the door. Following police investigations, the offender was identified to be the appellant. He was charged with attempted aggravated theft and found guilty of this sole charge by the Magistrates Court. He appealed, arguing that the elements required for attempted theft to subsist were missing. He claimed to be a homeless man and all he did was ask for money. For one to be found guilty of an attempted crime, the offender must have not only committed preparatory overt acts but must have also commenced the execution of the crime. Such acts must also necessarily be coupled with the intent to commit the crime; in this case, theft. While the appellant denied that he had placed his foot at the door to block the victim from shutting it, he contended that such an act would have been, at best, a mere preparatory act not an act commencing the execution of the crime of theft. He moreover held that the prosecution fell short of proving that he acted with the criminal intent to actually commit theft. According to the appellant, the mere act, in and of itself, of preventing the door from being shut was not sufficient to conclusively infer that the appellant formed a criminal intent to commit theft. He argued that the prosecution could have only assumptively reached such a conclusion and therefore it fell short of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Criminal Appeal disagreed with these contentions. Proceeding to cite doctrine and jurisprudence to explain the notion of ‘criminal attempt’ and its consitituent elements, the court noted that the offender did not only stick his foot at the door to prevent its closure, but had also falsely purported to be the victim’s nephew while knocking at her door and even called her ‘nann’ (grandmother). This factor, coupled with the appellant’s deliberate act of placing his foot at the door, clearly showed that his intention was indeed to enter the household and commit theft. The Court of Criminal Appeal moreover pointed out that the appellant had at no point voluntarily desisted. There was nothing to show that he voluntarily removed his foot from the door and the only plausible reason why he eventually did so was because the victim used force in her efforts to shut it closed. In light of these combined factors, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the Court of First Instance was correct in reaching its decision of finding guilt. It held that with his actions, the appellant committed preparatory acts which were clearly aimed at carrying out the crime of theft. In other words, the Court of Criminal Appeal was convinced that the appellant’s actions amounted to the commencement of the execution of the crime of theft and the actual theft failed to take place owing to an accidental cause independent of his will – i.e., the victim’s efforts of shutting her door closed. On the basis of such considerations, the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed the judgment delivered at first instance in its entirety, consequently confirming the appellant’s conviction and punishment.

MDA suggests summertime construction ban in Gozo entertainment areas,Times of Malta,"Developers have pushed back against calls to ban all demolition and excavation works in Gozo throughout summer months, saying that would financially ruin many employers and their workers. Instead, the Malta Development Association is open to extending the proposed summertime ban to all construction-related activities - not just demolition and construction - in areas designated as ‘entertainment priority areas’ in Gozo’s local plan. It also suggested having transparent criteria to determine which roads the summertime ban will apply to, and for the list of those roads to be publicly disclosed more than six months in advance, to allow investors and contractors to plan their schedules and transition to non-affected areas. The MDA’s proposals come after Gozitan tourism stakeholders said that the entire island should be free of demolition and excavation works during the busy summer months. Currently, the Building and Construction Authority bans such activities in specific streets and areas between mid-June and the end of September. Last summer, the ban applied to Xlendi and Marsalforn as well as certain streets in Mġarr, Għajnsielem, Għasri, Ramla l-Ħamra, Xagħra, Qala, Sannat, San Lawrenz and Victoria.  Gozo Tourism Association CEO Joe Muscat told Times of Malta earlier this week that since Gozo is a tourist area, the ban should apply all across the island. The MDA says that sort of blanket measure would ruin many developers, harming their workers and workers’ families in the process. “Expecting businesses to remain idle for three months is economically untenable,” it said on Saturday. “The financial strain includes the inability to cover employee salaries, interest payments, licensing fees for trucks and equipment, and rent during the downtime.” It said that its alternative proposals would alleviate the impact on Gozo tourism while ensuring developers remained financially viable. “MDA intends to engage in discussions with the Minister and relevant stakeholders to ensure that an adequate balance is met, fostering a collaborative resolution that accommodates the concerns of all parties involved,” it said.

Radio station RTK 103 to take BA to court over Lowell fine,Times of Malta,"Radio station RTK 103 is to take legal action to nullify a Broadcasting Authority decision to fine it in connection with comments made by show host Andrew Azzopardi. In a statement on Saturday, the radio station and Azzopardi said they would be requesting a judicial review of the decision, which they said set a dangerous precedent for local media. Azzopardi described far-right candidate Norman Lowell as racist and said he would never allow him as a guest onto his show. Lowell’s party Imperium Europa subsequently filed a complaint with the BA, which concluded that Azzopardi was guilty of unfair and unjust treatment and fined RTK 103 €6,410 - €1,750 for the comments and a €4,660 fine for an unrelated incident which it had previously suspended. RTK 103, which slammed the decision as ""illogical"", now intends to contest that decision on various grounds. It noted that Lowell was convicted of inciting racial hatred by a court of appeal and that a separate court had also concluded that any reasonable reader could derive racism, xenophobia and hatred from the far-right candidate’s political messages.  “Mr Lowell himself is even on record describing himself as a ‘racialist’ - which by any dictionary definition means racist,” it said as it argued that Azzopardi’s description of Lowell was a fair value judgment based on facts. It also noted that the BA had fined the station and host for having posed a hypothetical scenario which did not take place, in the course of interviewing the BA’s own CEO. The radio station said the BA had selectively quoted from Azzopardi’s words in its charge and omitted a sentence “which clearly showed that he was asking about a scenario on the BA’s directives which are not yet in place.” RTK 103 also noted that the BA has in the past fined TV stations that hosted Lowell, while it was now insisting that he should be hosted on Azzopardi’s show. The station noted that the BA had seen no reason to intervene until Imperium Europa filed a complaint. Then, rather than handle it as a complaint it treated the issue under a different procedure and charged the station with breaching the Broadcasting Act, it said, noting with concern that the BA board secretary is a former general secretary of Imperium Europa.   “The approach adopted by the Broadcasting Authority sets a dangerous precedent for the Maltese media, particularly when the Authority insists that the station ought to give airtime to Normal Lowell to broadcast his racist views. The station was unequivocal from the start that it will not entertain or tolerate racial hatred,” RTK 103 said in a statement.    RELATED STORIES  RTK 103 and Azzopardi have launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the legal fees for the station to pursue this case in Court. “The aim is to defend the two fundamental principles: the right of every individual not to be discriminated against on the basis of race or ethnicity; and the right of freedom of expression which is a vital component of a free and functioning media in our society,” the station said as it urged people to donate.

Abela speaks of 'courage to change' as the return of Muscat looms,Times of Malta,"Robert Abela spoke about the “courage to change” at a Labour event which was overshadowed by rumours of reintegrating Joseph Muscat back into the party. “You cannot change unless you have the courage to face things. You can desire change, but if courage fails you then you will change nothing and you will only dream of changing things,” Abela told a Labour crowd. Held at Labour headquarters on Friday evening, the event celebrated the discovery of new historic documents dating back to the start of the Labour Party 100 years ago. Abela’s speech focused on what he said was the party’s vocation to bring about change. “Being conservative is easy, because it means just keeping things as they are or changing to preserve the status quo. The Labour Party was created to bring about radical change, so it never found an easy path,” he said. Among those attending the event was Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat, who on Friday acknowledged that he is contemplating running for MEP in June’s European Parliament elections. Muscat served as prime minister between 2013 and 2020 and led Labour to two record general election victories before being forced to resign in disgrace under the shadow of anti-corruption protests. He has since restyled himself as a business consultant, working for clients such as developers’ lobby chief Michael Stivala, Dragonara casino tycoon Johann Schembri and a Swiss firm linked to the failed hospital privatisation deal deemed fraudulent by a court.   Abela has made it clear he will not stand in the way of a Muscat MEP candidacy and on Friday evening launched a scathing attack on a magistrate probing the hospitals' deal. In the past month, he has also made overtures to Rosianne Cutajar and Justyne Caruana, two Labour MPs first elected under Muscat who were forced out following separate misappropriation scandals.   During his speech on Friday, Abela said Labour was always about the little guy. “We continue to work for that principle every day. We invest in people, we help the poor and strengthen the middle class we have created,” he said. Abela said that people’s priorities changed as they moved up the socio-economic ladder “and we need to be there to attend to those aspirations”.

Health Minister pushes for more weight-loss surgery to tackle obesity,Daniel Ellul,"Weight-loss surgery and medication are “cornerstones” in tackling obesity, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela told parliament.      “We want to increase the number of weight loss operations in government hospitals by increasing the staff complement and offering incentives,” he said.    Abela was answering questions by Labour MP Romilda Zarb and Nationalist MP Robert Cutajar on Tuesday. He then provided more details to Times of Malta. Abela, a surgeon by profession, said: “In our hospitals, we are perhaps not seeing the same number of surgeries as we see abroad. I believe there is more to be done.”  Asked about which specific surgeries he was referring to, Abela mentioned gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.  A gastric bypass involves dividing the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger ‘lower’ remnant pouch, with the small intestine rearranged to connect to both. Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure where a portion of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller, banana-shaped stomach, reducing food intake and promoting weight loss.  The health minister also said that better nutrition and more exercise are essential in tackling obesity.  “We need an aggressive cross-party national campaign to raise awareness about obesity. We cannot modify our genes but we can change our eating, drinking and exercise habits to avoid unhealthy obesity,” he said.    He said a campaign against obesity needs to be as powerful as “an electoral campaign”.   The minister was speaking hours after the parliamentary public accounts committee discussed a National Audit Office report on obesity. Rebecca Vassallo, who spearheaded the report, told the committee that most of the 2020 goals set in Malta’s obesity policy were not met.  That strategy aimed to reduce the rate of adult obesity from 22 per cent to at least 18 per cent and the pre-obesity rate from 36 per cent to 33 per cent.  While the rate of pre-obese adults has remained stable, the percentage of obese adults “increased substantially”, the report said.   RELATED STORIES  Another target − to reduce child obesity from 32 per cent to 27 per cent − also failed, “and the rate increased significantly from the starting point”, it said.  The NAO report also compares Malta’s obesity rates with other countries through various studies. Malta’s adult population is the most obese in the EU, according to the European Health Interview Survey.  In 2018, the year with the last available data, 28.1 per cent of the adult population was obese.   Malta also had the most obese adolescents, according to another study among 45 countries. With 8.9 per cent of the school-age population reported as obese, Malta’s obesity rate is significantly higher than the second most obese country in the group − Canada, which reported 5.6 per cent of its adolescent population as obese.  Contacted by Times of Malta, PN MP Robert Cutajar said the Nationalist Party had proposed several measures to combat obesity some years ago.  “I hope that they are adopted by the government and the new health minister,” he said.  The measures include a specific number of hours dedicated to physical education as part of school curriculums. He said schools must also be legally obliged to provide healthy food. Day centres for the elderly should also serve only healthy food, he added. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Watch: Robert Abela slams Vitals inquiry, defends Joseph Muscat",Jacob Borg,"Updated at 10pm on Saturday Robert Abela on Friday cast doubts on the integrity of a magisterial inquiry investigating potential money laundering and corruption by his predecessor Joseph Muscat.  Speaking outside Labour HQ before an event, the prime minister brushed off concerns about Muscat's potential MEP candidature. Muscat was present at the same event.  ""Joseph Muscat was never out of the Labour Party. I believe he has more to give to Labour. God forbid I base my decisions on this inquiry,"" Abela said.    The prime minister ranted against the ""exaggerated"" delays in the inquiry's conclusion.  ""How much longer are we going to have to wait for this inquiry? The inquiry has been pending for four and a half years. An inquiry that according to the law should have been ready in 60 days, has been pending for four years,"" Abela said.  The inquiry has zoomed in on suspicious payments Muscat received by a Swiss intermediary linked to former hospital concessionaries VGH and Steward Healthcare.    A civil court last year concluded that the concession should be annulled due to collusion and fraud.   RELATED STORIES  Abela on Friday also cast suspicions about the potential timing of these conclusions, questioning whether it was designed to cause the Labour Party maximum damage prior to the European Parliament elections.  The prime minister echoed Muscat's protestations about Facebook posts by the inquiring magistrate's family members.  Muscat is seeking the removal of magistrate Gabriella Vella from the inquiry over these Facebook posts. The former prime minister has claimed that Vella's family members ""promote propaganda"" by those who filed the inquiry, a reference to rule-of-law NGO Repubblika.   Abela also took up another of Muscat's battles, questioning how ex-PN MP Jason Azzopardi knew about plans to search the ex-prime minister's home as part of the inquiry.  Arriving at Labour HQ prior to Abela, Muscat distanced himself from the push for him to be an EP candidate.  ""I haven't even spoken to my wife about it,"" Muscat quipped.  Muscat said he has yet to take a decision, and had no part in the push for him to be a candidate.    The ex-prime minister refused to say if he had discussed the matter with Abela.  Muscat brushed off insinuations that he was seeking a seat in the European Parliament in order to benefit from immunity from prosecution.  ""I do not need immunity from anything,"" Muscat said.  Muscat said any proper investigation would prove he had done nothing wrong.  Muscat has 'lost control' - Grech Reacting to the Prime Minister’s words on Friday evening, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said Abela “had his back against the wall” and had lost control by “attacking the country’s courts.” In a post on Facebook, Grech condemned Abela casting doubts on the integrity of the ministerial inquiry, which he said the Prime Minister had done to “save his own skin”.   “I strongly condemn the attack on our courts which should have all the serenity to continue doing their duty according to the constitution of Malta,” Grech said.  “When Labor are in government, the crisis in the Labor Party becomes a crisis in the Country.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Lawyer’s challenge against judicial appointments fails,Edwina Brincat,"Veteran lawyer Anna Mallia’s challenge of the appointment of four new judges by the Judicial Appointments Committee three years ago, fell through after a court declared that the applicant had no victim status in the case.  Mallia had filed proceedings before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction claiming that the committee had not been validly constituted, had “circumvented” the Constitution and acted beyond its powers.  Consequently, the committee’s recommendations for the appointment of the four candidates to the bench as judges were to be annulled.  The first court, presided over by Mr Justice Grazio Mercieca, had delivered a preliminary judgment declaring that the applicant qualified for victim status. The case was one about an alleged breach of fundamental human rights and the court referred to the European Court of Human Rights case law which gave a wide interpretation to the notion of potential victim status in human rights cases.  The Judicial Appointments Committee as respondent in the suit, filed an appeal.   RELATED STORIES  On Friday, judgment was delivered by the Constitutional Court presided over by acting president Joseph R. Micallef together with judges Anthony Ellul and Robert G. Mangion.  The court observed that Mallia did not have victim status, whether direct or indirect.  The lawyer had declared that she had opened this case to ensure that other applicants interested in such appointments would go through a lawfully conducted process.  It was to ensure that the relative provisions of the Constitution were observed.  Such an interest to ensure that the law is observed was not tantamount to the juridical interest giving rise to victim status in a breach of rights case.  The fact that Mallia did not apply for the post, further added to her lack of victim status.  Since she had no personal interest in the case, she could not file her claims on behalf of a category of lawyers who applied for the judicial post, nor on behalf of lawyers in general.  Mallia’s eligibility for a post in respect of which she chose not to apply rendered her claims “totally remote and simply hypothetical,” and consequently premature, said the judges.  The aim of Mallia’s case is “purely academic” and thus insufficient to underpin victim status since none of her claims, even if one of them were to be upheld, would be of any use to the applicant or to serve as a basis for further action.  Additionally, Mallia’s eligibility for the post at the time when this case was filed, could change in future depending on the circumstances. This means that the applicant could not even claim that she could potentially be a victim in the future.  When all was considered the court upheld the appeal by the Committee and the State Advocate concluding that Mallia lacked victim status and had not acquired that status throughout the proceedings. Since she lacked legitimate interest, her claims could not be upheld.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

'Why should I say no?': Robert Abela open to Muscat running for MEP,Jessica Arena,"Robert Abela has left the door wide open for Joseph Muscat to run in the European Parliament elections, saying, ""Why should I say no to him?” The prime minister made his comments hours after his predecessor said he would not rule out standing as an MEP candidate for Labour.  “Joseph Muscat must make his own consideration about whether he should be a candidate for the Labour Party or not,” Abela said in an interview to be published in full on Saturday with Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103. “But if his answer is yes, why should I say no to him?”  Azzopardi asked the prime minister whether he would embrace Muscat as a candidate with the Labour Party, should he wish to contest.  Abela added that rumours that his relationship with Muscat is somewhat frosty are untrue and that he regularly communicated with his predecessor on various issues.  “All those who are trying to shove obstacles between us, those obstacles aren’t there,” he said.  Earlier on Friday Muscat said that he could not exclude running for the upcoming MEP election, but insisted this is not a frivolous decision that could be taken lightly.  The prospect of political comeback for the former prime minister was first mooted by Labour pundit Manwel Cuschieri, who asked his followers whether they wanted to see Muscat’s return to local politics by running for the European Parliament election.  “This is not a decision that is to be taken quickly because of a few Facebook messages,” Muscat said, adding that his focus was not on contesting the MEP election but “on other things”. However, when asked directly whether he ruled it out, Muscat said he could not rule out anything in life.

Use of parcel mail surges as shoppers turn to online retailers: MCA,Neville Borg,"The postage of small parcels under 2kg shot up by a staggering 72% last year, suggesting that people are resorting to online shopping more frequently, according to new data published by the Malta Communications Authority. Although the overall use of postal services dropped by over a fifth in the first three quarters of 2023 compared to the previous year, the use of parcel mail is up by almost 10%. While small parcel items increased by 72%, the number of larger items posted (weighing up to 31.5kg) also increased last year, albeit to a lesser degree at 5.5%. According to MCA, this surge is, “potentially driven by the evolving and expanding e-commerce landscape”. Until recently, people appeared to be shunning online shopping, with industry insiders saying that the double blow of Brexit and the pandemic brought about higher shipping costs and drove people to buy from their local retailers. However, this new data suggests that shoppers may once again be returning to online shopping in search of cheaper prices, as they feel the pinch of Malta’s increasing cost of living. The use of mobile data has continued to increase rapidly, rising by 51% in the first three quarters of 2023. The previous year had seen an even higher surge of 61%. This comes as an ever-increasing number of people use messaging apps such as WhatsApp to communicate both through text and audio or video calls. People's TV-viewing habits also appear to be shifting, with IPTV subscriptions growing at the expense of traditional cable TV services. Over 10,600 new IPTV subscriptions were registered in the first three quarters of 2023, a 15% rise over the previous year. Meanwhile, cable TV subscriptions dipped by over 5%, or a little more than 6,000 fewer subscribers. MCA attributes this change to “the ongoing shift to app-based television services”, such as streaming services. With more people consuming media through streaming services, high-speed internet is becoming increasingly important for consumers. While the number of fixed broadband subscriptions continues to inch upwards, growing by just over 3% in 2023, MCA reports that there is an ever-growing demand for high-speed connections of at least 100 megabytes per second (Mbps) and, in many cases, 500Mbps. 2023 saw almost 18,000 more subscribers logging on to broadband connections of over 100Mbps, compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of subscribers with a connection of at least 500Mbps has now risen to almost 39% of all subscribers.

Population grew by more than a quarter in 10 years - NSO,James Cummings,"Malta’s population grew by more than a quarter in ten years, according to official statistics published on Friday.   From 2012 to 2022, the population grew from over 421,000 to around 542,000, an increase of almost 29%, data from the National Statistics Office (NSO) shows.  The rise was mainly attributed to the increase in foreign nationals, which rose to account for a quarter of the population by 2022.    The NSO noted that while the Maltese population grew by only 1.7%, the foreign population grew five-fold from 6% in 2012 to 25% a decade later.  The male population also grew during the same period, rising to overtake the female population by five percentage points. In 2012, men accounted for 49.8% of the population, while by 2022 they represented 52.5%.  The rise in the proportion of men was a change for the country, which historically has been predominantly populated by women.   And with more than 35,000 residents, St Paul’s Bay overtook Birkirkara as the locality with the largest population.    Migration and where people live  The data shows St Paul’s Bay became much more popular over the 10 years, with its population more than doubling during that time.   While in 2012 Birkirkara had the largest population with almost 22,000 inhabitants, a decade later St Paul’s Bay led with more than 35,000 residents.  By contrast, Mdina was the locality with the smallest population in 2022, with only 202 residents living in the country’s old capital.  St Paul’s Bay was also popular with foreign nationals, hosting the second-highest number of non-Maltese in the country. The greatest number lived in Msida, where three out of five people were foreigners.   Meanwhile, Dingli had the least number of foreign residents, with less than three per cent of the population made up of non-Maltese.   The Northern Harbour district, which includes busy localities such as Birkirkara, Sliema and St Julian’s was the part of the country with the highest population density, which is measured by the number of people in a given area.    “The Northern Harbour district was the most densely populated district, at 7,019 resident population per square kilometre. Conversely, Gozo and Comino was the least densely populated district at 585 residents per square kilometre,” the NSO said.  And while Senglea was the most densely populated locality in 2012, a decade later it had been overtaken by Sliema, the data showed.   Birth and death  While the death rate remained “relatively stable” over the 10 years, the birth rate saw a slight drop from around 10 births per 1,000 people to eight in 2022. The number of deaths for the same population sample stayed consistent at around eight over the same period.   The fertility rate – which is measured by the number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age – also fell from 1.43 to 1.08, the NSO noted.   “This decline is partly attributed to the fact that while the number of annual resident live births has remained relatively stable over the period, the number of females of reproductive age in the population has increased,” it said.   Meanwhile, life expectancy increased by around one-and-a-half years over the decade, rising from 80.9 to 82.3 years. And while women continue to enjoy a better life expectancy both at birth and by the age of 65, the NSO said the gap had narrowed since 2012.

Gozo submits bid book to be European Region of Gastronomy 2026,Times of Malta,"The Gozo Regional Council has submitted a 60-page document highlighting Gozitan cuisine and food culture in its bid for the island to be named European Region of Gastronomy 2026. The document details Gozitan food traditions, staples such as ftira, ġbejniet and olive oil and the people who make them, as well as gastronomical events that are held in Gozo.  Gozo is one of three regions in Europe bidding to named the 2026 region of gastronomy, competing against Crete and a region in Croatia, Kvarner.  Work on the bid started in late 2022 and the island formally launched its candidacy in April last year.  The winning bid will be decided by the International Institute of Gastronomy Culture, Arts and Tourism, based on the bid books submitted by the three candidates and an in-person evaluation in February.  Gozo's bid book was prepared by the ARC team and Ponder & Pitch with assistance and coordination from the Gozo Regional Manager in charge of culture. Aside from promoting Gozitan food culture, the bid book also lists 23 different projects submitted by NGOs that the Gozo Regional Council intends to implement, should the island win the 2026 title.  Gozo Region president Samuel Azzopardi said: “Gozo has a rich gastronomical and cultural identity. We are looking at ensuring the prevalent authenticity for years to come.""

"Too many children are waiting for LSEs, PN says",Daniel Ellul,"Too many children are waiting to be appointed a learning support educator, PN MP Graziella Attard Previ said on Friday as she criticised the ""unacceptable"" situation.    “It is even more unacceptable that one child has been waiting for a year and a half,” Attard Previ said.   The PN MP was addressing the media on the doorstep of the education ministry, following answers to parliamentary questions on the topic. She was flanked by education shadow minister Justin Schembri.   On Monday, Education Minister Clifton Grima said that there are 180 pending applications by children requesting an LSE, with the oldest application dating to October 2022.  A parliamentary question answered earlier this month also shows that 1,473 students have a full-time LSE and 2,729 have a shared LSE.   LSEs are assigned to children with specific educational needs, to ensure they can be integrated into mainstream classrooms.  “The period when students are waiting for an LSE is a formative time for students when they are forming their mental and psychological skills,” Attard Previ said on Friday. “There is a lack of will to fix the situation, and it seems that the authorities have given up,” Attard Previ said.   She noted that Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon had failed to provide any solutions apart from saying that not enough people are interested in applying for LSE jobs and that there was an open call for applicants.  Education shadow minister Schembri said that educators' working conditions must improve if candidates are to be attracted to the sector and existing staff retained.  He urged the government to conclude ongoing negotiations with the Malta Union of Teachers over a new collective deal for teachers.  In reaction to the press conference, the Education Ministry said that while the PN MPs claim to have alternatives to better the education system, they did not present any solutions as to how this can be achieved.  The Ministry said not only has it taken action when it comes to addressing the growing number of requests for LSEs but it has strengthened the way LSEs are employed and authorised a second Statementing Board to process applications without delay, among other measures.  The government said that in 2022 some 808 students were approved to receive LSE services, with another 840 being approved in 2023, for a total of 1,648 students. As of the end of 2023, the Ministry said that it has 2,862 LSEs employed in state schools, with the number of new LSEs being hired growing every year. In terms of pending cases, the earliest case dates back to 2022 and does not involve a student with disabilities or a severe condition.  There are a total of 108 students who are still waiting for an LSE, some of which have been fully processed by the Ministry but for which the parents or guardian of the child did not reply to requests to meet from the statementing board.

Minister brushes off Iklin residents' complaints about noise from school,Giulia Magri,"The Education Ministry has brushed aside complaints by Iklin residents about unbearable noise from a local school making their lives miserable.  Residents have pleaded with authorities to lower the volume of loudspeakers at Maria Regina School, saying the ""sheer screeching voice"" that makes announcements runs from 8am into the afternoon. But Education Minister Clifton Grima sees no reason to act.  “This school is doing nothing different from other schools in Malta and Gozo,” he said.  About 50 Iklin residents have signed a petition to stop the music and announcements. The petition was sent to Education authorities, the school itself, Iklin and Naxxar local councils, the police and the Environment and Resources Authority.    Yet speaking on parliament on Monday, minister Grima said the school is doing nothing different from other schools in Malta and Gozo. Grima was replying to a parliamentary question asked by PN MP Julie Zahra on Monday. In the petition, the residents wrote:  “Despite our complaints, the school management has preferred to ignore them. To add insult to injury, the volume has increased over the past months.” When Times of Malta previously contacted the school, its head said questions had to be sent through the education ministry.  Questions sent to the education ministry last November remained unanswered.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

New collective agreement for HSBC Bank Malta staff,Times of Malta,"HSBC Bank Malta p.l.c. and the Malta Union of Bank Employees (MUBE) have signed a new collective agreement until 2026, described in a statement as “ground-breaking”. The bank said that through the new agreement, the bank was signalling its strong commitment to its people as a cornerstone of customer service excellence and its goal to innovate and improve. The “ambitious” agreement is characterised by significant enhancements to employee pay, benefits and retirement pension plans. The agreement was signed this week in Malta, and then validated at HSBC Continental Europe’s HQ in Paris by its CEO, Andrew Wild, and the CEO of HSBC Bank Malta.  HSBC Continental Europe is the majority shareholder of HSBC Bank Malta. The collaborative and professional negotiation process between HSBC Bank Malta and MUBE underscores a shared commitment to the bank’s strategy that focuses on fostering an environment of excellence in customer service and supporting the growth and development of every employee, the bank said in a statement on Friday. Geoffrey Fichte, CEO of HSBC Bank Malta said: “I am pleased to confirm the signing of this new collective agreement with MUBE, reflecting our commitment to our people as they are our key competitive advantage. ""This agreement is a key part of our transformation journey, laying the foundation for innovation, transformation, customer service excellence and business growth. I am personally very motivated by the bright future ahead and look forward to working together with our colleagues to achieve success not only for them personally, but also for our stakeholders.” MUBE President William Portelli added: “The Collective Agreement signed between MUBE and HSBC Bank Malta will take collaboration to another level whilst enhancing daily practice at the workplace as the business progresses with the digital transformation process.” Portelli said the agreement enhances efficiency, flexibility and a feel-good factor around the working environment to the benefit of the employees’ wellbeing and customers alike.  HSBC Bank Malta said it was committed to its role as a leading financial institution in Malta, continually striving for innovation and excellence in all facets of its operations. Last December, HSBC UK announced its plans to close its global call centre in Swatar by June, with a loss of around 200 jobs. The bank informed workers that it intended to close the centre as part of a wider restructuring exercise to streamline its operations. The workers of HSBC Global Services (UK) Limited Malta Branch (HSMB), locally known as HSBC Swatar Contact Centre, were informed of the company’s decision during a specially convened meeting. HSMB is a separate legal entity from HSBC Bank Malta plc so the bank's operations in Malta will not be affected by the decision. It serves HSBC UK Bank plc exclusively and primarily provides customer service and customer due diligence to UK customers.

PN should 'go to police' if they have match-fixing evidence - Sports Minister,Daniel Ellul,"Sports Minister Clifton Grima has challenged the Nationalist party to go to the police with any evidence of match-fixing after an MP told parliament it was widespread in Maltese football. David Agius told parliament on Tuesday that the results of many local matches are pre-determined and that people in the know are already aware of who will win the Malta Premier League.  The shadow sports minister referred to a specific, undated match when he claimed a goalkeeper was offered "" a bag full of cash"" to let in four goals, and when he refused, a reserve goalkeeper let the goals in any way.  Asked about the claims, Grima said the comments were ""unacceptable"". He said: ""If they know about anything, they should report everything to the police.""    RELATED STORIES  The sports minister's comments reflect those made by the Malta Football Association on Wednesday, who said claims of corruption in the local sport were ""mere speculation"" and a ""slap in the face"" to footballers and fans.  Speaking about his time as a committee member with Sliema Wanderers, Grima said that he had gone to the police when he had evidence of match fixing.   ""I went to the police commissioner back in 2010 or 2011. Action was taken, and there were even procedures in court,"" he said.   ""If they (members of the opposition) know anything, they should go to the police. That's what I did when I had information, and others should do the same"".   There have been cases of match-fixing in Maltese football. In 2021, Rudgear Scerri was handed a suspended sentence and a €50,000 fine after admitting to match-fixing charges relating to Attard FC.     And in 2018, Uchenna Anyanwu, manager of the Pembroke Athleta football team, was handed a one-year suspended jail term, and fined €1,000.  Two former members of the Under-21 Maltese national football team, Kyle Cesare, and Emanuel Briffa, were also found guilty of match-fixing after a court of appeal overturned the original judgment that had cleared them. Grima said the Authority for Integrity in Maltese Sport was created to battle corruption and that amendments to the Sports Governance and Integrity Act will strengthen powers in the fight against corruption.

Epic restores services after road works damage cable,James Cummings,"Updated 4.50pm with Epic announcement of restoration of most services Communications company Epic said on Thursday that it will be compensating customers after an outage lasting several hours left thousands without internet, TV and mobile services. The outage was caused by damage to a cable during road works in Gudja on Thursday morning. Epic sent a photo showing a section of excavated road works which revealed a severed underground cable.  In a statement just before 5pm the company said home internet and TV services had been restored and that it would contact customers in the coming days with details of how they would be compensated for the outage. Earlier in the day, the company said the outage was “intermittent” and mostly restricted to southern localities but social media users were quick to comment they had been without service continuously, and in other areas as well. The outage impacted home internet and TV clients and those using the company’s mobile network, including mobile phone and ‘plug and play’ users. The Plug & Play service offers home internet through wifi routers that connect to the company’s mobile network rather than telephone lines. Customers were informed of the outage by SMS text message, which said mobile service interruptions had been “caused by a third-party contractor doing road works not related to Epic's operations.” “Kindly note that customers on home internet and TV packages below 1GB [gigabytes] are affected in all areas across Malta and Gozo. The southern part of Malta is affected for Mobile connectivity and Plug & Play,” Epic said.   It said mobile and Plug & Play customers in southern areas including Vittoriosa, Luqa, Marsaxlokk and Żabbar had been affected, among others. Epic pledged to restore the service by the end of the day.  Social media users said the outage had been more widespread, with users indicating that San Ġwann, Msida, Gzira, Sliema and parts of Gozo had also been affected. Responding to questions, Epic told Times of Malta that ""mobile connectivity and Plug & Play fixed services were impacted in the South, whilst home internet services for some packages affected all customers.""

"PA meeting postponed, board members resign in 'normal practice' after reshuffle",Matthew Xuereb,"A Planning Authority board meeting had to be postponed on Thursday after the members resigned, as is normal practice upon a change of minister. Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi's planning portfolio was transferred to Gozo minister Clint Camilleri in the recent cabinet reshuffle and the PA board has not been confirmed or reconstituted since.   The board was meant to decide on several applications, one of which was about the new Institute for Tourism Studies campus planned for Smart City in Kalkara. The Planning Authority informed objectors that the application could not be discussed on Thursday but did not give a reason.  A spokesperson for the PA said when questioned that following a change in ministerial roles, all planning board members tendered their resignation as per normal procedure. The composition of the planning board will be announced in the coming days.     The PA  unanimously approved the permit for the construction of the new ITS campus in August 2022. However, it still needed to discuss part of the permit that had been marked as a reserved matter. The new campus will include a gymnasium, an indoor pool and spa and two levels of underground parking. The ITS has been operating from a temporary campus in Luqa since 2018 after the site of its campus in Pembroke was controversially handed to the db Group which intends to build a hotel, residences and an entertainment and retail complex. The new campus will be located to the southwest of Smart City in an area of just under 9,200 square metres. The PA board was also set to decide on an application to extend a building in Battery Street, Valletta by three floors and to divide it into five residential units. The application was recommended for refusal. The board was also due to decide on an application to sanction the General Soft Drinks Ltd Marsa factory as built including an extension to guard rooms, shifting of internal and external walls, an extension to part of the warehouse, a canopy, and changes to the external parking layout. The application, which was slated for approval, also proposed a new parking layout.   The final application on the agenda was the proposed demolition of an agricultural shed, a block of apartments and a restaurant in Triq il-Palma, Mellieha, to be replaced by six dwellings with pools. The project is proposed by CF Developers Ltd. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Sedqa joins calls for downward revision of drug amounts proposed in white paper,Times of Malta,"The drug limits indicated in a recently published white paper on the revision of the drug laws should be revised downwards, the Sedqa agency said on Thursday. The white paper proposed to change the limits set in two already-existing laws which offer guidelines on how people caught in possession of drugs are treated.  The guidelines are intended to help courts decide how harshly the accused is to be treated. One consideration would be the amount of drugs that a person was caught carrying, setting out separate limits for different types of drugs. The Nationalist Party was among critics of the white paper who warned that the new proposals could lead to a situation where traffickers were treated as if they were victims.  Sedqa is the government's own agency which deals with dependency issues. It said in a statement it was consulted about the white paper at an early stage before its publication and had submitted its preliminary views. While it agreed with most of what was suggested, it was now formally submitting its own views. On the controversial issue of how those found in possession of drugs are to be treated, based on the amount of drugs they carried, Sedqa said the amounts indicated in the white paper should be reduced so as to strike a balance between judicial flexibility in genuine cases (where the person concerned is also a victim) and firm action against those who might otherwise try to go around the system with a pseudo drugs problem. The agency said it agreed with the penalties for those convicted of drug trafficking who did not themselves have a drug problem.  The Chamber of Advocates earlier this week objected to the possibility of life imprisonment for traffickers, saying this concept was draconian and had been removed by most democratic countries.

"Patients crowding in hospital corridors due to bed shortage, Delia claims",Jessica Arena,"Patients at Mater Dei hospital are being forced into “undignified” situations as they wait for beds to free up, the shadow minister for health, Adrian Delia, said on Thursday.  Speaking at a press conference, he highlighted persistent issues with long waiting lists at the country’s main hospital and warned that a staff shortage and staff burnout were close to leading Malta’s healthcare into a “critical emergency”.  Delia produced photos from inside Mater Dei showing patients being treated “like a number” with beds crammed into corridors and canteens due to a lack of space in the wards.  A shortage of beds is also forcing some patients to remain on stretchers until a suitable bed can be found for them, Delia said.  “We are stripping our patients of all of their dignity,"" he said.    PN MP Stephen Spiteri said that the emergency department in particular was facing huge pressures, with some patients only being seen by a doctor a day after their admission.  “This is too big of a delay for treatment and reflects inefficiency and a lack of quality in our hospital,” he said.  “Patients are suffering and workers are burnt out because they are being overburdened. Some people are being seen by a doctor a day after they go to emergency, which in turn delays diagnosis and treatment. On top of that, if you need to be admitted after being seen, you’ll have to wait even longer to get to a bed in a ward.”  Delia said that the country was suffering the consequences of the government’s lack of investment in healthcare - a consequence of the “world-class fraud” that was spent on the Vitals and Steward deal.  Showing video footage of a dirty and unkept stairwell, which Delia said was shot from within the emergency department, he added that the upkeep of infrastructure at Mater Dei was also faltering.    Echoing Bernard Grech’s comments on Wednesday evening, Delia said that the government’s lack of planning and foresight in the healthcare sector was creating a caste of haves and have-nots in healthcare by forcing those who could not wait for an appointment amid long waiting lists to seek private care.  “This is becoming a social problem because there are people who can resort to private healthcare and others who cannot,” he said.  “As the Opposition we will continue to fight these injustices and offer immediate and long-term solutions,” Delia continued.  “We are not going to treat health issues like political football, because where health is concerned, there is no red or blue, only making sure that people are getting the treatment that they deserve,” he said.

Sandra Ramirez murder case delayed as defence challenges femicide law,Diana Cacciottolo,"The compilation of evidence against a man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend in Sliema has been delayed after the defence challenged Malta's new femicide law.  Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada denies the aggravated crime of femicide, which was introduced in the Criminal Code in 2022 and makes him liable to a harsher punishment. His case was due to begin on Thursday but was deferred until next month after his defence said the new law was discriminatory and breached his fundamental rights. Colombian national Sandra Ramirez, 43, was found dead with stab wounds on her body in an apartment on Sir George Borg Street on January 13. Her ex-boyfriend, also from Colombia, turned himself in to police and told them through a translation app: ""I murdered my ex-partner in an argument inside my home."" The accused, 39, is the second person to be charged with the aggravated crime of femicide.  Roderick Cassar, who stands accused of the femicide of his estranged wife, Bernice, is also challenging the new law before the constitutional courts.  According to the criminal code, a homicide can be considered a femicide if a woman is killed as a result of domestic violence, honour killings, misogynistic intentions, religious practices such as genital mutilation, and sexual abuse. Under the reform, the ‘crime of passion’ defence, which has been used in the past to secure softer sentencing, will no longer be considered an extenuating factor when the judge decides on any punishment in the case of femicide.   RELATED STORIES  Defence lawyers José Herrera and Matthew Xuereb argued that the accused should not be denied this line of defence outright. ""There is discrimination,"" Herrera told the court, ""because persons accused of murder end up in a different position if the victim is a woman. In case of femicide, the accused is placed at a disadvantage."" The defence asked for the court to refer the case to the constitutional court to decide on the ""human rights issue"". Herrera argued that if the defence were to file a separate constitutional case, the criminal case would still continue. But if they asked the court for a reference, the criminal case would be suspended. Jacob Magri, lawyer for the victim's family, who were not present in court, argued that the excuse of sudden passion is not excluded outright as femicide is an aggravating factor to homicide so the circumstances for that aggravation need to be proved. The court accepted the prosecution's call for some time to file a written reply to the ""unexpected and unusual request"" and the case was deferred until February 6. 1.18pm The court defers the case to February 6. But it’s not over yet. Defence lawyer Bugeja tells the court that the accused was being denied all his personal possessions.  ""He’s going to end up with the same clothes, underwear and shoes for life!” remarks Herrera. The court minutes that the accused was not being given access to his belongings, including money, and so he had to depend on third parties. The defence said that if necessary the accused should be escorted to his Sliema home so that he could collect his personal belongings. He has no one to do that for him. The court ordered notification of this minute to the Corradino authorities and ordered that the accused be given his belongings and all necessary assistance to collect his belongings from the residence where he lived before the incident. 1.15pm There’s some debate at the moment because the Attorney General lawyer questions whether the court will start to hear evidence today. And obviously that is not what the defence wants today. Attorney General lawyers say that the defence should have raised this constitutional issue in a written application before the hearing. The defence hits back saying that such a request may be raised in open court.   1.10pm The court grants the prosecution time to file a written reply to the defence's request. Jacob Magri, lawyer for the victim's family, argues that the justification is not excluded outright and is still available to the defence.  This is because femicide is not a separate crime but an aggravating factor to homicide. So the circumstances for that aggravation need to be proved. Herrera disagrees and wants the criminal case to be suspended for now. He says that if the defence were to file a separate constitutional case, the criminal case would still continue. But if they asked the court for a reference, the criminal case would be suspended. 1.06pm The defence lawyer explains his concern that sudden passion cannot be claimed as defence in this case. “We are not saying that this is our only defence,” says Herrera but asks why the defence should be denied this line of defence outright. He says it's important at this very early stage for the defence to know what the constitutional position is today. His colleague Matthew Xuereb steps in.  ""The law denying this legal plea outright militates against leniency,"" he says ""This is a diligent move by the accused, even if upholding it would suspend this case.""  1.03pm A quick explainer here. The concept of femicide was only introduced in to Maltese law in 2022. According to the criminal code, a homicide can be considered a femicide if a woman is killed as a result of domestic violence, honour killings, misogynistic intentions, religious practices such as genital mutilation, and sexual abuse. The key issue is that the ‘crime of passion’ justification – something used often by defences to get a softer punishment for the perpetrator - is no longer considered an acceptable factor when the judge comes to decide on any punishment in the case of a femicide. 12.53pm Within ten minutes of the compilation of evidence beginning, lawyers for the defence raise a challenge to the relatively new femicide law. Herrera argues that the accused has been discriminated against because of the aggravating charge of femicide. It impinges upon his right to a fair hearing, the defence lawyer says. The defence wants the constitutional court to settle the issue and for the time limits on the compilation of evidence to be suspended in the meantime. 12.49pm We need an interpreter for this case. While she comes over from another hall, court is informed that lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri and Frank Anthony Tabone will represent the victim’s family who today are not present in court. Lawyer Yanika Bugeja is also joining the defence team. 12.45pm The accused, Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada, has just been escorted into court along with his lawyers, José Herrera and Matthew Xuereb. Inspector Wayne Camilleri is prosecuting together with Attorney General lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Ramon Bonett Sladden.

"Man stopped by police over brake lights, charged with drug possession",Edwina Brincat,"A driver, flagged down by community police over malfunctioning brake lights, ended up in greater trouble when officers sensed a ""strong smell of cannabis"" coming from the vehicle.  Omar Alhamdoalgorsh, a 26-year-old Syrian gypsum worker from Buġibba, was escorted to court on Thursday after being arrested two days ago.  Court was told that on Tuesday, community police patrolling the St Paul's Bay area spotted a vehicle with malfunctioning rear brake lights. They flagged down the driver and when they approached the vehicle they smelt ""a strong scent of cannabis"", prosecuting inspector Francesco Mizzi told court on Thursday.  A search of the vehicle yielded two sachets of cannabis on the dashboard. The officers found another bag of cannabis and a sachet containing eight ecstasy pills.  The driver was escorted to the Qawra police station, given his legal rights and told the reason for the arrest.  Asked by defence lawyer Noel Bianco, the prosecutor said that the accused had cooperated all along.  The man's family lived in Malta and he had a stable job, argued the lawyer when pushing for bail.  Moreover, he had cooperated fully, telling police how he acquired the drug.  As for the amounts, the accused had bought the drugs to share with a friend who was on holiday in Malta and staying at a hotel, pointed out the prosecutor, objecting to the request for bail.  The defence countered that the accused had admitted to police that he needed help to quit drugs and even cried under interrogation.  After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, upheld the request under various conditions, including a treatment order.  The accused would be monitored by a probation officer who was to report to court every two months.  ""One negative report will spell repercussions,"" warned the magistrate.  The accused was to pay a deposit of €500, bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000, sign the bail book twice weekly and be home between 10pm and 6am. Inspector Francesco Mizzi prosecuted.

MCAST directives to be suspended on Tuesday following negotiations breakthrough,Times of Malta,"The teachers' union will be suspending directives at MCAST following progress in its discussions about the college educators' collective agreement. In recent weeks the MUT registered a trade dispute with MCAST over a delayed collective agreement that left students without exam results for two months. Last week MCAST students walked out of their lectures, protesting the action. Hours before the students' protest, the Education Ministry had said it would ""intervene"" to help conclude negotiations. The protests went ahead. On Thursday, the MUT said that through the intervention of the Education Ministry, the union and the college had reached a way forward to continue and conclude negotiations. ""There were intense meetings to iron out differences and to expedite negotiations of a new agreement. ""Significant progress has now been registered and the MUT shall be meeting lecturing grades next Tuesday to update them about the progress in negotiations. Meetings with other grades will follow,"" the union said. MUT added it will be suspending the directive on student marks on Tuesday. In a statement MCAST welcomed the MUT’s decision. It said talks on staff working conditions had been constructive, and significant progress has been made.   The Nationalist Party in a reaction said the government should not have waited two years after the collective agreement expired to intervene to get the talks moving.    The Robert Abela government should not have delayed talks with the lecturers while Mcast students suffered months of uncertainty during which they did not get marks or feedback on their assignments, shadow minister Justin Schembri said.

"Patient, doctors report out-of-stock scabies meds, ministry denies shortage",Giulia Magri,"Updated 1.30pm A woman suffering from scabies has described her feeling of helplessness as one of the medications to treat the highly infectious skin condition is currently out of stock. Dermatologists confirmed with Times of Malta that tablets needed by those suffering from scabies were out of stock. However, on Thursday a spokesperson for the Health Ministry said the medication was available from Mater Dei.  Scabies is a contagious skin infection caused by tiny burrowing mites called sarcoptes scabiei. The mites burrow into the skin and lay their eggs, which causes a rash and intense itching. The woman has had scabies since December and reached out to Times of Malta after she tried to get her hands on ivermectin tablets, which are used to treat the condition. The infection can easily be treated through medication that can be applied to the skin or taken orally. A person can be infected with scabies through prolonged skin-to-skin contact or even by sharing personal items such as clothing or bedding. After using perimetrin cream for a month and not witnessing any progress, the woman decided to go to St James Hospital and was prescribed ivermectin on Saturday. She said she tried to purchase the medication at several pharmacies but said all of them informed her this was out of stock. “I called Mater Dei Hospital, and they did not have any stock of the medication either,” she said. “This is outrageous. I don’t know what to do and my quality of life has been affected.” The Maltese Association of Dermatology and Venerology (MADV) confirmed that ivermectin is out of stock at the Mater Dei Hospital pharmacy. A MADV spokesperson said this is a ‘continuous issue’ and it was not the first time such a shortage has taken place. Last April, the MADV and the Malta Association of Public Health Medicine complained that an outbreak of scabies was being untreated because the country lacked the required medication. The medication was back in stock after nine weeks. “It’s a disgrace that we keep facing this shortage, and in reality, such medication should never be out of stock,” the spokesperson said. “This has happened before, and the problem has not been solved.” The spokesperson said MADV members and other dermatologists have seen a slight increase in scabies cases, and it was flagged to their attention that ivermectin tablets were out of stock. Answering questions by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry said the ivermectin tablets were back in stock. He said despite an international sourcing issue, the Central Procurement and Supplies Unit had managed to ""increase the supply"". The supply, he added, was ""being monitored continuously"".   ""Permethrin is used for the same indication as ivermectin and supply has been continuous to MDH pharmacy too"". He added there was currently no alert of any outbreak of scabies. A total of 240 people were reported to have scabies throughout 2023. Of these, 142 were sporadic cases while 66 were outbreaks. So far this year, the authorities have been notified of eight cases.

Ian Borg to head to Kyiv as chair of world’s largest regional security body,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Ian Borg is to visit Kyiv next week as the chair of the world’s largest regional security body in a show of “unwavering support” to Ukraine while demanding that Russia withdraws unconditionally and immediately from the territory. He announced the visit to a room full of diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, the United States and more than 50 other countries across North America, Europe and Central Asia on Thursday, as he takes the helm of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) amid heightened tensions in the region and within the organisation. “Next week I will visit Kyiv to demonstrate our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “I, and the Maltese Chairpersonship will continue to demand Russia’s full, unconditional and immediate withdrawal from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.  “I reiterate my strongest condemnation of the intensified attacks witnessed in the last weeks.”   It was an inaugural address that officially launched Malta’s last-minute takeover of the significantly organisation, which has lately been grappling with finding common ground between the West and Russia and its allies. In the presence of Russian and Ukrainian diplomats, Borg made it clear that Malta’s primary priority for the OSCE is the “unequivocal commitment to keeping Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine at the top of the OSCE agenda”. “Let us do everything possible to break the chain of relentless violence, anguish, and suffering we are witnessing, not only in this war but in conflicts around the world. Let us halt all deliberate destruction of vital infrastructure and all civilian deaths. Let us reverse the normalisation of this callous indifference to human life,” he said.  “What we do for peace today will help determine whether we live in war tomorrow.”   The OSCE was founded in the 1970s to ease tensions between the East and the West during the Cold War and to this day remains one of the only remaining political communication platforms between the West and Russia and its allies. Borg said Malta’s leadership will work tirelessly to safeguard and uphold the principles and commitments set out when the OSCE was founded in 1975. “Let me remind you that these are not optional – they are shared obligations to which we have all collectively agreed,” he told diplomats. The OSCE brings together 57 states from the global north to discuss and take action on conflict prevention and arms control and to foster economic development in the region, ensure sustainable use of natural resources, promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, freedom of the press and free and fair elections.  They represent around one billion people and the decisions they take are politically, but not legally binding. Moscow, however, has been increasingly accusing the bloc of turning away from its founding principles. This complicates things further, as the OSCE works with unanimity. No decision can be made, no action can be taken and no successor can be chosen unless all countries agree to it. This is essentially why late last year Malta was unexpectedly chosen to lead the OSCE throughout 2024, after Russia vetoed Estonia’s bid for the chairpersonship. The presidency rotates annually and Malta was the only country all participating states – including the US and Russia – could agree on, despite its clear stand in favour of Ukraine in the ongoing war. On Thursday Borg said Malta’s other “overarching priority” for this presidency is to secure a budget and future leadership for the OSCE. The states’ unanimous agreement to appoint Malta as head “was a glimmer of hope, but we are not out of the woods”. Borg also called for a more secure Mediterranean region, reiterating that “there could be no European security without Mediterranean security”. The OSCE will also strengthen resilience against cyber threats, promote compliance with conventional arms control commitments, pursue closer cooperation on climate resilience and mitigation, combat corruption, violence against women and human trafficking, enhance food security, and push initiatives on media literacy and the safety of journalists online and offline, particularly female journalists, he said. “Our engagement is governed by our conviction in the imperative need of restoring our planet to a state of peace,” he said. “Our engagement is governed by our sense of purpose to serve as a bridge in the world around us, inspired by Malta’s unique position at the crossroads of East and West, of Europe and Africa.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

State Advocate's effort to reverse judge recusal in hospitals case abhorrent: PN,Edwina Brincat,"The State Advocate was exerting “undue pressure” when requesting a judge to revoke his decision to abstain from hearing the Opposition’s case concerning the hospitals' privatisation deal, and such an attitude was “abhorrent”, the PN's lawyers are claiming.  That was the line of argument pushed by the Opposition in its reply to an application filed on Tuesday by the State Advocate who has called upon Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti to revoke a decree through which he abstained from presiding over the case filed by PN leader Bernard Grech and MP Adrian Delia. That lawsuit, following up on the appeal judgment confirming the annulment of the fraudulent Vitals privatisation deal, is aimed at getting the State Advocate to recover funds swindled out of the public coffers in that concession which the court held to be vitiated by collusion.  On Monday, the judge was expected to deliver a decree on a request by the government and the cabinet to intervene in the case.  But instead, shortly before the early morning sitting, Mr Justice Grixti delivered a decree saying he was abstaining because his partner - lawyer Yanika Bugeja - had been appointed to act as curator representing Steward Assets Management Malta on the deed of rescission of ground rent on the lands concerning the public hospitals.  The judge came to know about that appointment on January 18, a day ahead of the signing of the contract of rescission.  And since Steward was among the people named by the Opposition to be sued for the recovery of the funds, that situation gave rise to a conflict of interest that meant that the judge “did not feel at all serene” in continuing to preside over the case.  However, that recusal was challenged the next day by the State Advocate who argued that the judge had failed to follow correct legal procedure. On Thursday, the Opposition rebutted the State Advocate’s arguments through a reply filed in the records of the case.  A decision to abstain or for recusal could not be appealed, nor could it be challenged by any of the parties.  Mr Justice Grixti was “correct” in stepping back when his conscience told him that there was a conflict and all the parties, as well as their lawyers, were to respect that decision, rather than exert “moral pressure” on the judge, the Opposition said in its reply. This was in line with the principle that justice must not only done but must be seen to be done. The State Advocate could not expect to pressure the judge when there was no change in circumstances giving rise to the conflict perceived by the judge, it added. And that was even more so when it was Judge Grixti himself who raised the issue of his own free will.  Such “undue pressure” was abhorrent and deserved reprimand because it amounted to tampering with the judge’s freedom in deciding to abstain. The irony of it all was that when during the first hearing the Opposition’s lawyer had flagged the judge’s familial ties to a medical professor who had been involved in the due diligence process greenlighting Vitals as the original concessionaire, the State Advocate and the Cabinet representatives claimed that the Opposition was exerting pressure on the court.  Moreover, it was not true that the judge had not followed proper procedure.  According to the case minute dated January 22, the recusal decree was delivered in open court.  The judge may deliver such a decree in writing and in that case, his declaration is to be inserted in the case register before the date of hearing and the parties must be served notice.  In this case, the parties were informed of that decision earlier via email. One cannot understand why the State Advocate should object to the judge’s decision taken freely and according to law, argued the Opposition.  The State Advocate was “trying to force [the Judge] to hear and decide a case where, to his knowledge, the judge feels he cannot deliver justice” because of the conflict triggered by his partner’s appointment as curator.  The State Advocate’s request was frivolous, vexatious, abusive and unlawful, tampering with the judge’s freedom to make decisions in the best interests of justice, it added. It also demonstrated “blatant disrespect” towards the sitting judge by subjecting his integrity to such “pathetic discussion,” said the Opposition, wrapping up its reply.

"'Claims that Lowell is racist, xenophobic based on facts': journalists, authors",Times of Malta,"Journalists and authors have slammed the Broadcasting Authority's decision to fine RTK 103 when a presenter said he would refuse airtime to ""racist"" Norman Lowell. The Institute of Maltese Journalists also expressed concern that the secretary of the Broadcasting Authority's board is a former member of the far-right party led by Lowell himself. On Tuesday, RTK 103 was ordered to pay €1,750 after show host Andrew Azzopardi said he would never allow Lowell on his show. Lowell is the leader of Imperium Europa. In 2013, an appeals court confirmed a Magistrates' Court judgment finding Lowell guilty of three charges of inciting racial hatred. Azzopardi's description of Lowell was made as he interviewed the CEO of the Broadcasting Authority, Joanna Spiteri, about the BA's rules on fairness last October. Reacting, RTK 103 said the Broadcasting Authority was “indirectly defending” a person convicted of inciting racial hatred, when it fined the Church-owned radio station. The station is appealing for funds to support the programme and the station to consider further legal action.  On Thursday, PEN Malta called the BA's decision ""disgraceful"" while referring to Lowell as a “racialist” and a ""notorious Nazi sympathiser"". The decision, it said was ""nothing short of an egregious display of absurdity and an assault on the presenter's freedom of speech"". Penalising a station for rejecting a purveyor of hate speech and racial animosity like Lowell was a slap in the face to common decency and journalistic integrity, PEN Malta said. ""Racism should never be legitimised as a political view, and the authority's failure to recognise this is shameful."" The courts had found Lowell guilty of inciting hatred and therefore, Azzopardi’s term was not used frivolously or as an insult, it said, adding that irrespective of that, Azzopardi had the fundamental right to free speech in declaring himself against hosting a ""Nazi sympathiser"" on his programme and could not be penalised for saying so. ""This spineless move exposes the institution's blatant detachment from contemporary values and its alarming lack of commitment to combating hate. ""It is a shameful testament to the BA's irrelevance and moral bankruptcy. It has now set a worrying precedent for Maltese broadcasters. Malta has enough racism as it is. The last thing we need is to institutionalise it."" In a separate statement, the Institute of Maltese Journalists (IĠM) said Azzopardi's comments that Lowell was racist and xenophobic were ""based on facts that emerged from court judgments"". IĠM expressed solidarity with Azzopardi and RTK103, saying it disagreed with the BA's decision.  ""Azzopardi had the right to argue that people who are racist are not invited to his programme as this remains the station’s editorial discretion. ""It also falls within the parameters of freedom of speech. We also understand that a person who is mentioned in a programme should have the right of reply if their intentions or actions are misrepresented or are subject to defamation, as the Media and Defamation Act says after all."" The IĠM said it felt that the host had based his argument on facts that emerged from court judgments and therefore there was no obligation for Lowell to be heard necessarily. Despite this, the station offered the right of reply on which there was no agreement. ""If Lowell felt defamed, he could seek redress in court and not ask for a decision from the BA, which, in this case, acted as accuser and judge at the same time. The IĠM said it is also concerned that the secretary of the authority's board, Dr Adriano Spiteri, was an active member of Imperium Europa until a few years ago. This is a situation that casts doubt on the impartiality of the board, as much as it is worrying that the appointment of the board depends only on people nominated by the two political parties represented in the parliament. The IĠM therefore could not agree with the ""unjust decision"" which, it said, opened the door to ""a dangerous precedent"" where anyone who thinks they have suffered unfair treatment seeks satisfaction from the authority.

Watch: ‘Malta is not being pressured to join NATO’ – Ian Borg,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Malta is not being pressured to join NATO, Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg said on the eve of the official launch of Malta’s take-over of the world’s largest regional security body. The vast majority of the Maltese people support Malta’s military neutrality and have no intention of changing that position, he told Times of Malta in Vienna. He was fielding questions on whether he fears the Ukraine war could spread across Europe.   “Malta cannot join military alliances and we expect all countries to act responsibly and refrain from invading other territories without reason,” he said. “Russia started the war and if it stops it, then most other problems will stop with it.” Late last year Malta was unexpectedly chosen to lead the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) throughout 2024, after Russia vetoed Estonia’s bid for the chairpersonship. The presidency rotates annually and Malta was the only country all participating states – including the US and Russia – could agree on. This is even though Malta has taken a clear stand in favour of Ukraine in the war and Borg, has, as OSCE chair, reiterated that Russia must withdraw immediately from the entire territory of Ukraine. On Wednesday Borg told Times of Malta Russia is demanding that the OSCE refrains from focusing solely on the Ukraine war and that it condemns the killing of innocent civilians in Russia. “If Russia stops the war no soldiers or civilians will die. That is our message, while we continue to condemn civilian killings,” he said. “I am not ready to compromise on our principles. We respect international laws and expect that all states do the same. You cannot wake up one morning and decide to invade your neighbour, just because you’re more powerful than them.” Borg, who is serving as chair-in-office on behalf of Malta, is expected to highlight Russia’s war in Ukraine as one of Malta’s overarching priorities in his address at the official inauguration of Malta’s presidency in Vienna on Thursday morning. The OSCE was founded in the 1970s to ease tensions between the East and the West during the Cold War and to this day remains one of the only remaining political communication platforms between the West and Russia and its allies. The body brings together 57 states from North America to Europe and Asia to discuss and take action on conflict prevention and arms control and to foster economic development in the region, ensure sustainable use of natural resources, promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, freedom of the press and free and fair elections. Borg is expecting a tough year. He must bring together mammoth political powers and seek unanimous consensus at a time when two of them – Russia and Ukraine – continue to fight a raging war and during a volatile period when there will be elections in the US, in Russia and across the whole of Europe. “This is an organisation in which countries who are at war sit down together to find common solutions, and no decision can go ahead unless all countries agree on it,” he said. “We must even have consensus on the aid countries send to Ukraine.” Borg must constantly bridge deep political divisions while running an organisation that has not had an approved budget since 2021 and which risks falling apart if there is no consensus on which countries should run it in the coming years. As Borg strives to see that the organisation has a healthy future, Russia is insisting it must know who the contenders to lead the OSCE in the coming years are because it has no faith in some of them, he said. This is essentially what happened late last year when Malta was chosen to take over the chairpersonship at the last minute. “The decision to put Malta at the helm saved the OSCE,” Borg said. All countries have already agreed Finland should take the lead next year, commemorating 50 years since the organisation was founded in Helsinki in 1975. But Borg must secure consensus on the country that will take the lead in 2026. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Wondering where the għ goes in a Maltese verb? New website to the rescue,Sarah Carabott,"Have you ever helped a child with their Maltese homework and been unsure how to conjugate a verb or where the għ and h go? Did you resort to referring to the voluminous dictionary by Prof Joseph Aquilina or asking the online community on Facebook how best to conjugate a verb, risking misspelling the word? A new website – www.verb.mt – has come to the rescue with over 6,000 conjugated verbs accessible from any online device. And the reference website – that took Reuben Degiorgio two years to compile – is set to remain free for users after the National Literacy Agency stepped in to sponsor it. Degiorgio, who worked as a translator, reviser and terminologist in the Maltese translation unit at the Council of the European Union for some nine years, set about compiling the verbs after noticing people would ask online forums the same questions about verb conjugations over and over again. “They would ask which model to use and how to actually use it, where to put the għ or h, to which form does a certain verb belong to... I told myself this just won’t do, especially at a time when everyone instinctively consults the internet for anything. “It was glaringly obvious that we were missing an essential digital resource, so I decided to create one myself from scratch,” he said. Inspired by the Bescherelle guide, considered the French verb conjugation bible, Degiorgio spent two years painstakingly conjugating every single verb, consulting with language experts when he was unsure. “I wanted this to be a very complete source of information, so all the Maltese verbs that I could find are in there – even rare or archaic ones. When people think about Maltese verbs, for some reason the only ones that come to mind are those of Arabic origin. I made sure to also include those verbs originating from Italian such as (i)kkonċentra (concentrate), awgura (augur) or sforza (force) and English such as (i)ttajpja (type), (i)pparkja (park), (i)ċċarġja (charge) because they are part and parcel of our language and should be treated as such.” Degiorgio says verb.mt has also become popular overseas with those learning Maltese but living in Australia, Canada and the US, among others. While there are other references and guides on Maltese verb conjugations, some are limited to just some examples while others are not reliable. Verb.mt is also the only website solely dedicated to Maltese verbs. Degiorgio is also the man behind Għidha bil-Malti (Say it in Maltese), which kicked off in 2017 as a small Facebook page to promote a renewed sense of appreciation of the Maltese language and to encourage Maltese speakers to use the language properly. On Għidha bil-Malti, Degiorgio shares with thousands of users anything from common orthographic mistakes to examples of Maltese names for newborns. Għidha bil-Malti, which is also on Instagram and Threads, has since branched off to other side projects such verb.mt, qawl.mt (website dedicated to Maltese sayings, a work in progress ), Ismijiet Maltin (an extensive list of every Maltese name) and a website featuring some of the content posted on social media.

Ian Borg’s Russia-West balancing act as Malta takes on OSCE chair,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Updated 1.40pm Russia’s war in Ukraine will be one of Malta’s “overarching priorities” as it takes on the chair of the world’s largest regional security body in Vienna on Thursday morning and launches its priorities for the OSCE presidency. As Foreign Minister Ian Borg prepares to preside over the permanent council meeting of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), sources close to government and the OSCE said the situation in Ukraine and its impact on the rest of Europe is expected to top the agenda, amid heightened tensions in the region. Borg is only weeks into his chairmanship, after Malta was unexpectedly chosen to lead the organisation instead of Estonia, as Russia vetoed the idea of an Estonian presidency. “The overarching priorities will be mainly the safeguarding of the organisation and addressing conflicts in the region, particularly Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” senior sources told Times of Malta in Vienna. As Borg prepares to bring together politicians, diplomats, and policymakers from 57 states across Europe, North America, and Asia, he faces tough, unprecedented challenges to create meaningful dialogue between all sides in a way that leads to more peace and security in the region. Malta was the only country all OSCE member states could agree on to preside over the organisation.  This is even though Malta has taken a clear stand in favour of Ukraine in the war and Borg, has, as OSCE chair, reiterated that that Russia must withdraw immediately from the entire territory of Ukraine. He also made it clear that Malta remains committed to providing Ukraine with aid and support programmes. Ukraine, meanwhile, wants the OSCE to expel Russia, as the Council of Europe has done, warning the body faced a “slow death” if Moscow remains a member. Critics of that reasoning, however, argue that allowing Russia to remain a participating member of the body is one of the best and only shots at bringing it to the discussion table in a bid to find diplomatic solutions. The OSCE was founded in the 1970s to ease tensions between the East and the West during the Cold War. It was a remarkably successful effort at the time to bring together the world’s powers in a bid to avoid further conflict, and to this day it remains one of the only remaining political communication platforms between the West and Russia and its allies. The body brings together states to discuss and take action on conflict prevention and arms control and to foster economic development in the region, ensure sustainable use of natural resources, promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, freedom of the press and free and fair elections. Moscow, however, has been increasingly accusing the bloc of turning away from its founding principles. This complicates things further for Borg, as the OSCE is a consensus-driven body – meaning its major and most crucial decisions are taken unanimously by all the participating states. Russia, or any one state, can block any major decision by refusing to support it. Fielding reporters’ questions at a press conference following the permanent council meeting, Borg said he intends to primarily listen to the Ukrainian authorities to better understand their challenges and needs when he is in Kyiv, and find useful ways to support them through the OSCE’s several multi-million euro projects. “In Kyiv, the most important thing is to listen. I don’t want to send out the message that I know it all, or that I know what they need,” he said. “I will visit Kyiv and will do whatever it takes to keep the organisation alive and functional.” Asked whether he excludes also visiting Russia during his tenure, he was non-committal. OSCE diplomats were already collaborating “daily and weekly” on a technical level with all member states, including with Russia, he said. He also did not say whether Russia had yet reacted to his address and whether the OSCE would explore ways to expel it in case it failed to cooperate and continued to create deadlocks.

"Watch: ‘I’m afraid. I don’t want to fall again’, 82-year-old Sliema woman says",Claudia Calleja,"Up until December 4, Carmelina Borg was an independent and active 82-year-old woman who went on her daily walks in Sliema and even went for morning swims in the summer. But an incident that day put a stop to that and Carmelina now fears venturing outside her apartment in High Street, Sliema.   As she made her way to the hairdresser that morning, she tripped over an uneven, cobbled pavement, a few metres up the road from her home, fracturing her left hip. The trip led to more than a month of pain and rehabilitation, and she now has to use a Zimmer frame to walk. The elderly woman also missed out on a planned trip to London to visit her youngest daughter over Christmas.  RELATED STORIES  But while her hip is slowly healing, Carmelina lives in fear of falling again. “I’m afraid. I don’t want to fall again. It was so painful. I’m still doing physiotherapy. All this has cost me and my children lots of money – medical bills and the loss of my paid flight to London – and I live on a pension,” she says, sitting at her home. After spending 10 days in a private hospital and two weeks in a private care home undergoing physiotherapy and rehabilitation, Carmelina has not left her apartment except to attend medical appointments accompanied by her children.   Carmelina’s daughter Laura Vassallo, the eldest of her three children, reached out to Times of Malta to raise awareness about the dangerous state of the pavements in High Street and several other parts of Sliema. “They are a health hazard. A pavement is there for people to walk on and not to trip on. My mother was a very active 82-year-old. Now she is no longer an active 82-year-old. We hope that she returns to the way she was because the fear is making her housebound. She is terrified of going out,” she says. Carmelina’s story is not unique. Over the years many have spoken about the hazardous state of pavements around the island. The dire need to repair Malta’s pavements was flagged recently in a report, compiled by the Faculty for Social Well-being, that laid out recommendations to address loneliness – that is impacting more than half the population. Among its 100 diverse recommendations, the report flagged the need to further encourage people to leave the solitude of their homes by pedestrianising more areas in city and village centres and drawing up a national plan to fix pavements to allow people safe access to places where they can mingle.

From 'do you still love me?' to 'I’ll kill you' - man admits threatening mother,Edwina Brincat,"A young man admitted in court on Wednesday that he had sent his mother a threatening message after she ignored his earlier messages asking whether she still loved him. The incident took place on Monday when the 22-year old courier from Qrendi, sent his mother a text message asking: “do you still love me?” The mother apparently did not reply, prompting other messages along the same line from her son. Feeling scorned and wanting to grab his mother’s attention, the youth texted one last time. “I’ll kill you,” he wrote. That message prompted his mother to report the matter to the police, triggering investigations which resulted in the son’s arraignment on Wednesday. The young man, whose name is banned under court order, admitted to causing his mother to fear violence, insulting and threatening her as well as misusing electronic communications equipment. His lawyer, Jason Azzopardi, explained that the accused suffered from ADHD. Although he lived with his father, he had the support of relatives who were all present in court. Sentencing was put off pending a pre-sentencing report as requested by his lawyer. A request for bail was upheld by the court against a minimal deposit of €200, a personal guarantee of €3800, once weekly signing of the bail book and a curfew. “You only have one mother. Cherish her,” advised Magistrate Joseph Mifsud, as the young man nodded in understanding. Inspector Audrey Micallef prosecuted. Lawyer Jason Azzopardi was defence counsel.

Benefit fraudster becomes first person jailed for role in scam,Edwina Brincat,"A man has become the first person to be sentenced to jail in connection with a disability benefits scam that involved hundreds of people.  Brian Aber, 46, defrauded the Department of Social Security out of some €18,000 for roughly four-and-a-half years stretching from 2019 to 2023. He admitted to the fraud and also pleaded guilty to recidivism, using falsified documents and breaching probation.   On Wednesday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello sentenced him to two years in prison, noting that the fraud was committed “repeatedly and systematically” between January 2019 and July 2023. The court did not punish him for the offences for which he was placed under probation last March. The magistrate acknowledged that Aber had issues related to a previous breakup and needed help to address those issues, but ruled that he could not be let off with a community service sentence, given that he had continued to commit the fraud while under probation. Aber’s lawyer Jose Herrera informed the court that he intends to appeal the prison sentence. Aber has agreed to refund the amount defrauded and has signed an agreement with the Department of Social Security to that effect. He has already refunded some €2,000 and the pending balance is €16,358.74, the court heard. The disability fraud racket saw hundreds of people receive monthly benefit payments after they used falsified documents to be certified as severely disabled. Applicants were guided by fixers who obtained the false documents for them and guided them through the application process. In many cases, applicants claimed to be severely epileptic. Former Labour MP Silvio Grixti, a family doctor, is suspected of being at the heart of the scam. He resigned in late 2020 when police began investigating the claims. The scam, however, remained hidden from public view until Times of Malta exposed it last year. Police have since accelerated prosecutions of suspected benefit fraudsters, who until Aber had all been ordered to pay back money defrauded and handed suspended sentences or community service orders.  Grixti has not been charged with any crime. Replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Albert Buttigieg, Social Welfare Minister Michael Falzon said on Wednesday that the fraud is estimated to amount to €2.4 million in total. Around €1 million has been reimbursed so far. The minister said an internal board was continuing to investigate the processes for the granting of social benefits but, he stressed the board was not investigating individual cases. The plan was for the report of the board to be eventually tabled in parliament. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

MFA slams David Agius 'speculation' about corruption in Maltese football,Valhmor Camilleri,"The Malta Football Association has shot down PN MP David Agius’ claims of corruption in the local sport as “mere speculation” and a “slap in the face” to footballers and fans. “It is extremely disappointing for the Association to note that discussion in the country’s highest political institution is reduced to conjecture and speculation when debating a matter of such importance for sport in general,” the MFA said. ""So many people dedicate time, effort, and resources daily to contribute towards the game. Some of the reported claims are nothing short of a slap in the face for all those athletes, volunteers, and most of all fans.” Agius claimed in a parliamentary speech on Tuesday evening that many local matches are fixed and that people in the know are already aware of who will win the Malta Premier League. He said bets running into several thousand euro were being placed on fixed matches, and cited a specific example from a match. ""How can it be that a goalkeeper is asked to let in four goals in return for a bag full of cash, and after he refuses, the reserve goalkeeper plays instead and lets four goals in any way,"" Agius, who is the PN’s spokesperson for sports and also running as an MEP candidate, said. ""In this country, no one does anything."" Agius, however, stopped short of naming players, teams or specific matches he believes are tainted. In its statement, the MFA said it was dismayed by Agius’ claims, which it said damaged the reputation of the local sport. “While the Malta FA welcomes any constructive discussion on integrity issues in Maltese sport and proposals to strengthen the tools in the fight against corruption, the Association solicits all parties involved to exercise caution not to generate unfounded speculation, tarnishing the image of local football in the process,” it said. “Such speculation hardly does justice to the efforts of football administrators who dedicate their time and energy, mostly voluntarily, to serve their clubs and communities.” The MFA also noted that anyone with information about corruption in football has a duty to report that to the police.  Times of Malta has asked the police if it is investigating claims related to corruption in local football. The MFA said that it remained “steadfast in its commitment to uphold integrity and fight corruption in football” and that its Anti-Corruption Task Force had played a leading role in the process leading to the Sports Governance and Integrity Bill currently being debated in parliament. The bill seeks to update laws concerning corruption in sport, to make it harder for cheats and streamline processes to ensure integrity in sport.

Heavy discount for local councils on devolution of properties,Matthew Xuereb,"Local councils can benefit from heavily discounted rates on the rental of government properties given to them to manage. Local government Parliamentary Secretary Alison Zerafa Civelli announced on Wednesday that councils will see a capping of the rental fees due for these properties.  She said this would allow councils to spend their budgets on other projects, in a better and more effective way. ""More funds for local councils means more investment in favor of improving residents' quality of life,"" she said. The fee will be capped at €500 a year and will apply retroactively to all public land handed to councils in the past when agreements are renewed.   Minister for Lands Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi said the government was always seeking ways of allowing councils more breathing space to operate and invest in projects that make a difference for the community.  He told the media this measure reaffirmed the government’s commitment to allow councils to spend their funds on other projects. Councils currently pay an amount based on the size of the property that is given to them to administer.  Both Zrinzo Azzopardi and Zerafa Civelli urged councils to come forward with their ideas and proposals.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Children 'exploited, treated as commodities' by football clubs: lobby group",Daniel Ellul,"Children as young as 12 are being “exploited” and “treated as financial commodities” by football clubs that can tie down players for years even if the young players are unhappy playing for them, a lobby group is claiming. “A recent incident involved the parents of a 16-year-old who were asked to pay €5,000 for their son to be able to move to another club even if his playing opportunities were limited,” The Malta Football Players Association said in a statement.   “In another case, the parents of three players aged between 16 and 17 had to fork out €1,500 each, over and above the €400 annual membership fee and €180 annual kit fee,” the statement reads.  The association has filed a complaint with the children's commissioner over the matter.  According to the Malta Football Association’s (MFA) rules on the transfer of players, 12-year-olds must commit themselves to a club for an “obligatory period of service” of three years.     Once that period lapses, they must recommit themselves till after they turn 18 if they want to continue playing.   The MFA rules say it is up to the club to decide if it wants to release a player. That means children cannot move to another team unless the club they belong to accepts.    The MFPA said that as a result, clubs often ask parents to pay a transfer fee to grant a release.  “Unfortunately, this system creates situations where minor amateurs are practically at the mercy of their clubs and treated as commodities,” MFPA added.   This practice has become the norm over the years, the association said, adding that local rules breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children, it claimed were being “exploited for economic gain”, and denied the right to leisure and their ability to participate in cultural life freely.   “The MFPA has taken action by filing a claim with the Office of the Commissioner for Children on behalf of numerous parents who have approached the association over the years”.

"Over 900,000 cruise passengers in 2023 - up by 65% over 2022",Jessica Arena,"Over 900,000 cruise passengers visited Malta through the Grand Harbour last year - a 65 per cent increase from 2022. In a press conference on Wednesday, Valletta Cruise Port CEO Stephen Xuereb said Malta’s sought-after natural harbour was a unique gem that drew in travellers seeking to experience the country’s natural beauty. Cruise passengers are estimated to have left some €85 million in the economy last year, with €32 million coming from tourists’ direct spending in Malta and €53 million from the cruise lines themselves. Some 23% of all cruise passengers last year were from home ports, meaning that their cruise started and ended in Malta, with Xuereb saying that work is ongoing to attract more vessels to have Malta serve as their home port. By 2028, the Maltese cruise industry is on track to having 50 new ships entering the industry, with 11 set to begin operating this year. Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said that the cruise industry can serve as a catalyst for tourism to Malta because a first-hand taste of the country is more effective than any marketing, and may encourage cruise passengers to choose Malta as their next holiday destination based on their cruise experience. Bartolo said the MTA was working towards attracting more companies to have Malta serve as their home port for cruising and attract more people to the island for the fly and cruise experience.“ In this initiative we are looking to strengthen our presence in markets outside of Europe in the interest of seeking higher quality tourists who can have a bigger impact on our economy,” he said.

"Meet Lewis Pugh, the man described as a 'human polar bear'",James Cummings,"When endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh was standing on the edge of the ice at the North Pole about to dive in, there was only one thing going through his mind. Pugh’s environmental concerns had driven him to one of the coldest places in the world for a symbolic one-kilometre swim he hoped would galvanise world leaders into action. “I wanted to show world leaders and the public that the Arctic had melted so much you could even swim across the North Pole,” he said. He explained that without that to get him through, it would have been all too easy to be overwhelmed by fear. “When you’re standing on the edge of the ice and the water is minus 1.7 degrees, you’ve got to be really focused. Because in that moment, fear can cripple you,” said Pugh, also known as the ‘human polar bear’. “You’ve got to have made your mind up that you’re going to get in and finish the swim, and you’ve got to have a reason for doing it.” Calling the area a “high-consequence environment”, with the nearest port a seven-day sail away, Pugh said the 18-minute and 50-second swim “felt like 18 hours”. But his efforts didn’t go unnoticed. As Pugh and his team began the long sail back, his satellite phone started lighting up with calls from media organisations around the world, including US talk show giant Jay Leno. All of them wanted to speak to the man who had just become the first person to complete a long-distance swim at the North Pole. Pugh was recounting the events of 2007 while visiting Malta to give a keynote speech at Deloitte’s annual forum on Friday, where he spoke about his efforts to combat climate change and “believing in something greater than yourself”. This was not his first time in the country, however, having spent some time in Malta as a young child. Pugh’s mother and father met in Malta while working as medical staff in the Royal Navy, with the family later being stationed at the old naval hospital in Mtarfa when Pugh was around five years old. At Friday’s conference, he was welcomed on stage by Maltese Olympian swimmer Neil Agius, someone Pugh describes as special. “There are very few swimmers in the world who can even imagine what he goes through. What Neil is doing now is discovering the outer edge of human capability,” he said. “There are literally only two or three swimmers in the world who can do the type of distances he can do... it’s truly astonishing what he’s been doing. Neil is special.” Pugh explained that although he and Agius had been communicating over the phone for several years, this visit was the first time they had met in person, adding their rapport had been instant. “It was like meeting an old friend,” he said. On Saturday morning, Pugh and Agius swam together for the first time at Mellieħa Bay, joined by 50 members of the public and those from Agius’s Ocean Festival and Waves of Change Malta communities.   Afterwards, Pugh spoke to the public about the importance of ocean conservation and tackling global climate change, two things close to his heart. “About a million species of plant and animal now are at real risk of going extinct. So, I try to do swims in places that are really threatened and then afterwards get them protected,” he explained. Pugh’s swim across the Ross Sea in Antarctica in 2015 helped lead to the creation of a protected marine area around 1.5 million square kilometres by convincing Russia to sign up to protect the fragile ecosystem. Since then, however, international efforts appear to have stalled, with The Guardian reporting in December that not a single G20 country was on track to achieve the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Is Pugh disheartened by this? “There is a lot of talk happening. But real systemic change which is required to actually tackle the climate crisis? I’m not seeing that at the moment. And yes, of course, I’m frustrated,” he said. “We’re running out of time. And we can’t keep saying we’re running out of time, because we really are running out of time.” Aside from its role in Pugh’s efforts to combat climate change, exercise is something he is passionate about more generally, explaining that in addition to swimming he also trains by running, kayaking and lifting weights to “keep things interesting”. “Exercise is so important for your mental health, not just your physical health. And I know that I’m not centred as a person unless I’ve done some exercise... It’s really important,” he said. But with obesity on the rise in Malta according to a National Audit Office report last year, does Pugh have any advice for people struggling to start exercising? “Start. Just start.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Maltese football games are fixed and the culprits are known - David Agius,Daniel Ellul,"Maltese football is corrupt, match results are pre-determined and league winners known ahead of time, PN MP David Agius has claimed. ""Here in Malta, people know who is going to win before the game is even played, and it's almost sure who will win the league this year,"" the PN's new sports shadow minister said on Tuesday. He said the people making sports dirty are known.  ""Is it possible we don't know who is corrupt in sport? Malta is small, and I think those people are known,"" he said.  Agius was speaking during a parliamentary debate on changes to the Sports Governance and Integrity Act. The changes will allow the formation of platforms and entities in the fight against sports corruption.  The Opposition backs the amendments, but Agius said more needs to be done to tackle corruption.  ""What are we really doing to catch those who are corrupt in sport?"" Agius asked, adding that action against corruption in sports was rare. Without providing evidence or naming names, Agius said results in football and other sports were fixed, with perpetrators then wagering large amounts on the outcome.  Bets going into ""many thousands of euros,""  were placed, with bets often including predictions on the outcome of other sports matches fixed overseas, he said.  ""How can it be that a goalkeeper is asked to let in four goals in return for a bag full of cash, and after he refuses, the reserve goalkeeper plays instead and lets four goals in any way,"" the sports shadow minister said.  ""In this country, no one does anything,"" he said.  He said new legal structures are welcome, but they alone will only remove corruption in sports if drastic action is taken.  The Malta Football Association seeks to keep a lid on corruption through its Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts Task Force, established in 2015.

Fact-check: Does a new drug reform mean that you can carry 500 ecstasy pills?,Neville Borg,"Claim: The new reform will allow a person to carry up to 500 ecstasy pills for personal use. Verdict: The reform does not relate to personal use, but will change guidelines that courts use when deciding whether a person caught trafficking is to be tried criminally or sent to rehabilitation. A magistrate can still charge a person criminally if they do not believe that their actions were driven by their drug habit. A recent white paper proposing reforms to Malta’s drug laws caused controversy and political bickering, with some claiming that it is proposing an increase in the quantity of drugs a person can carry for personal use. In one widely-shared video, a recovering drug addict spoke about the quantities addicts consume on a daily basis – which are only a fraction of the limits being proposed – using confectionery items in place of drugs to illustrate his point. Several current and former political figures also entered the fray. Opposition leader Bernard Grech made a similar argument in a video posted to his Facebook page, saying that “the government is pushing a white paper which allows you to carry 500 ecstasy pills”, a quantity that he argues is “surely not for personal use”.   Several others, including PN MPs Beppe Fenech Adami, Claudette Buttigieg and Ivan Castillo and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi also criticised the reforms, saying that anyone caught with those amounts would no longer be considered a drug trafficker but instead come to be seen as a victim. The white paper proposes several changes to drug laws, ranging from how drug courts are set up to how people who were caught with drugs in prison are treated. But it’s the proposed increase in drug limits that has sparked the debate. In practice, the white paper is proposing changes to the limits set in two already-existing laws (Chapters 31 and 101) which offer guidelines on how people caught in possession of drugs are treated.   These guidelines are intended to help courts decide how harshly the accused is to be treated, depending on several factors, such as whether they had a leading, significant or lesser role in the crime. So, for instance, a person caught trafficking drugs would be treated less harshly if they are believed to have been acting under the direction of others or selling drugs to finance their own drug habit. One of the factors that should be taken into consideration according to the guidelines (in fact, “a principal consideration”) is the amount of drugs that a person is caught carrying, setting out separate limits for different types of drugs. This means that people caught with amounts below these limits should not be tried in criminal court (often to be tried by a jury), but should instead be directed towards the magistrates' court.  No, not automatically. Even in cases where a person is caught with a quantity of drugs that is under the new limits, they could still be charged and sentenced as traffickers if the courts believe that they were acting on their own steam or played a central role in the crime. However, on the other hand, the magistrate may decide to set up a drug court if they believe that the person’s actions were driven by their addiction or that they were simply a small cog in a larger operation. In essence, being tried through a drug court means that a person is being directed towards rehabilitation services, rather than the criminal justice system. If found guilty through a drug court, a person can be ordered to follow a rehabilitation programme in one of Malta’s drug rehabilitation centres, rather than being sent to prison.   No, in reality, none of this applies in cases where a person is caught carrying a minimal amount of drugs for personal use (under two grams of ecstasy pills, for instance). A 2015 bill called the Drug Dependence (Treatment Not Imprisonment) Act sets out the punishment to be dealt in these cases. However, the new drug reform is not set to change this in any way. The reforms only apply to cases where a person is believed to be trafficking drugs or stands to be accused of aggravated possession. Just as has been the case for several years, the newly-proposed laws place the onus on the magistrate to decide which of the two routes – criminal court or drugs court – a person should face. This decision depends on whether the magistrate believes that the accused’s actions were driven by their addiction and that they can genuinely benefit from rehabilitation. If, on the other hand, the magistrate believes that the accused is trafficking drugs for reasons other than their own addiction, they may still be tried as drug traffickers in the same way as they are today. The punishment for trafficking and possession with intent is also not set to change under these new provisions.   More broadly, the proposed changes appear to follow a global trend away from the much-vaunted war on drugs policies that dominated the world’s approach to drugs throughout the end of the 20th century. A seminal 2011 report by the Global Commission for Drug Policy argued that “the global war on drugs has failed”, calling on governments to focus on rehabilitation strategies rather than criminalisation of drug users. United Nations and the World Health Organisation soon followed tack, saying that drug policy should be based on prevention and treatment, rather than criminal action. Malta's national drug policy for the next decade argues that the government has been “assisting” rather than punishing users in cases “related to possession of small amounts of illicit drugs for personal use”. Drug experts’ reactions to the proposed reforms have been mixed so far. Caritas director Anthony Gatt told Times of Malta that the introduction of drug courts in past years has been a positive step, but expressed concern that the reform could give rise to abuse. Meanwhile, Noel Xerri, CEO of Oasi Foundation, said that courts need to adopt a case-by-case approach, saying ““We don’t believe that the limits should go up, per se, but there should be more leeway for addicts who deal in drugs to be processed and get help first”. The proposed reform does not increase the quantity of drugs that a person can carry for personal use. The reforms will amend guidelines that the court uses to decide whether a person should be tried criminally or through a drug court (which typically leads to a person undergoing rehabilitation). The decision will remain in the magistrate’s hands. Even a person caught with quantities within the new limits can be tried criminally if the magistrate does not believe that their actions were driven by their drug habit. The reform is not proposing any change to the way a person believed to be maliciously trafficking drugs is handled.

"Office supply outpacing demand, property experts warn",James Cummings,"The supply of offices in the country is showing signs of outpacing demand, experts have warned. Rising inflation, higher interest rates and a lack of market transparency were all blamed for Malta’s commercial property market showing signs of faltering. And a surge in employees wanting to work from home against a property landscape dominated by undesirable office environments was not helping, they said. Speaking at panel discussion organised by the Malta Business Network on Monday evening, experts warned that despite the market’s healthy growth in previous years, questions were now being asked about its future. Hili Properties managing director George Kakouras said: “We should worry a lot about the office space... the pressure is here.” Speaking about the quality of office offerings, he stressed that those properties not able to “offer something special” would suffer more, potentially impacting their financial sustainability. “If they cannot offer something unique, then what are they doing there? Because, even if they are occupied, then the leases will be so cheap that the investment put into those properties will never pay off,” Kakouras said. PwC Malta director Angelique Spina said that despite “exponential” growth in Malta’s commercial property market in recent years, driven by the gaming and financial services sectors, high inflation and interest rates had led to stakeholders questioning the future of the market. She also highlighted a “lack of transparency in the market” with an absence of available data leading to foreign investors questioning the yield of commercial properties. “Unfortunately, it’s not as transparent as one would like it to be,” she said. Spina said that, though the market was faring well so far, there was “a lot of supply” combined with signs of the market slowing down, leading to a likely “gap” between the number of available properties and demand for them. This, she said, was driving a “flight towards quality” with companies increasingly shopping around for better offerings that more suit their needs. However, Spina noted that, with around only 250 commercial property transactions taking place each year, Malta’s office market remained relatively small.   Lara Camilleri, COO of HR solutions firm Expedition42, said employees wanted to carry through working from home arrangements, rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic, something most important to the younger generations. “It’s certainly a reality,” she said but noted it wasn’t appropriate to all sectors, identifying human resources and manufacturing as examples of industries incompatible with remote working. The HR expert also highlighted occasions when working from home was not convenient or realistically possible, identifying those who share an apartment with friends – a common occurrence among foreign nationals – as one example. “The likelihood they’re going to be able to work from home is very limited and often they will tell you that themselves,” she said. Catherine Hurley, head of global accounts at AIS Interiors, stressed that creating better commercial property offerings revolved around creating “serendipitous opportunities and meetings”. She said games rooms, collaborative spaces and access to technology were all things that could help encourage workers to want to return to the office, with moderator and Belair Property managing director Ian Casolani remarking such features had been popularised in Malta by the gaming industry. However, Hurley said it was important these offer experiences workers can’t get at home, rather than simply being “gimmicks”.

RTK fined after radio host says he'll never allow 'racist' Lowell on air,Times of Malta,"Church-owned radio station RTK has been ordered to pay €6,410 after show host Andrew Azzopardi said he would never allow ""racist"" Norman Lowell on his show. Lowell is the leader of the right-wing Imperium Europa political party. In 2013 an appeals court confirmed a Magistrates' Court judgement finding Lowell guilty of three charges of inciting racial hatred. Azzopardi's description of Lowell was made as he interviewed the CEO of the Broadcasting Authority, Joanna Spiteri, about the BA's rules on fairness last October.   Azzopardi, a university professor, had questioned how the BA could order him to invite candidates such as Lowell onto his show. He said he would never give Lowell air time. Josiah Vella, Secretary of Imperium Europa, immediately filed a complaint against Azzopardi, complaining that Azzopardi had breached impartiality rules and was censoring Lowell. He also argued that Azzopardi's comments amounted to a threat against the BA.  Communications between both sides failed to reach a settlement and the matter was discussed within the Broadcasting Authority.  The BA's CEO, Joanna Spiteri, told the board that she believed some of the comments made by Azzopardi breached the authority's rules. She described Azzopardi's comments about refusing to allow Lowell on the programme even if ordered to by the regulator as threatening. Spiteri also noted that Azzopardi had already previously breached a BA directive before the 2022 elections.  The BA board heard all the parties in the matter, including Lowell himself, who said he was after justice, not fines. RTK's legal representative said that despite the presenter's declaration, the radio station's doors were not closed to Imperium Europa and it was not censoring the party. He pointed to instances where its representatives were invited to programmes. He also presented court judgements involving Norman Lowell. The BA board ruled that Azzopardi had overstepped the limit and breached article 34 (1) of the Broadcasting Act, which forbids ""unjust or unfair treatment."" The radio show host could have made his point without mentioning any names, it noted. Furthermore, RTK had not distanced itself from those comments, even though it ultimately remained responsible for all content.  As a result, the board fined RTK €1,750 for the offence, which also triggered a previously suspended fine of €4,660.  The latter fine was issued in 2022 after Azzopardi aired comments by PN leader Bernard Grech on air on election day, in breach of broadcasting rules.  As a result, the radio station was ordered to pay a total fine of €6,410.  Correction January 24, 2024: A previous version stated that RTK was fined because of Azzopardi's description of Lowell as racist, rather than because he said he would not be allowed on air.

Plans to reform NGO laws to be opened to consultation next month,Times of Malta,"A plan to reform laws governing voluntary organisations will be presented for public consultation next month, the prime minister said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Robert Abela met with his cabinet of ministers at Dar tal-Providenza in Siġġiewi to discuss the plan and hear first-hand accounts of the challenges non-profits and voluntary organisations face. NGOs that work in the environmental, sports, cultural and youth sectors were among those that met with Malta’s cabinet. “We wanted to hear from those directly involved in the sector before discussing the plan in cabinet,” Abela told those who attended. Abela said the government wants to slash red tape and simplify bureaucratic processes for voluntary organisations. He described voluntary organisations as “strategic partners in the country’s socio-economic development” and said the reform plan would positively impact thousands of people who use such organisations or their services. Abela also used the occasion to announce that the government will soon be opening a fourth support centre for voluntary organisations in Gozo. Such organisations can make use of such centres to host meetings or activities. There are currently three such centres – one in Birkirkara, one in Rabat and a third in Valletta.   Earlier on Tuesday and before the cabinet meeting, Abela toured Dar tal-Providenza and met various residents at the home. Inclusion Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli accompanied him. The home’s director, Fr Martin Micallef, showed the prime minister around the home for people with a disability including a music room used for music therapy, an area where residents are preparing for carnival celebrations and an agricultural centre where residents grow their own crops to sell. Abela was also shown an exhibition by Dun Mikiel Azzopardi, the home’s founder, as well as ongoing works on an apartment that will be used to house additional residents.

Ramona Frendo nominated to the European Court of Justice,Times of Malta,"Ramona Frendo, who serves as a judge on the General Court of the European Union, is being nominated by the government as Malta's representative on the European Court of Justice.  The nomination follows a public call issued in October last year and a selection process, after which the selection committee recommended Frendo for the post, the Justice Ministry said.   Justice Minister Jonathan Attard congratulated Frendo and said he was confident that her experience in the general court would serve her in good stead and she would also be a worthy representative of Malta.  Ramona Frendo graduated as a lawyer 26 years ago, her experience covering civil, insurance, industrial, family and criminal law, as well as consultancy and drafting services to commercial entities and public authorities. She served as a member on the Justice Reform Commission 2013, responsible for a critical and comprehensive analysis of procedural and substantive law. She also served as chair of the Visa Working Party during the Maltese Presidency of the Council in 2017 and was nominated to the EU General Court in 2018. Dr Frendo endorsed the Labour Party in the 2013 general election and appeared on the PL's billboards. She will take up her post in October, subject to approval by EU organs. She succeeds Peter J. Xuereb who served as judge on the court for six years.  He too previously served on the European Union's General Court.

Malta Life Sciences Park restaurant operated without a licence and paid no rent,Neville Borg,"A restaurant at the Malta Life Sciences Park operated without a licence for years, paid no rent and carried out renovations without planning permission, the National Audit Office has found. Zenzero, a restaurant run by Cook & Co Ltd, opened in January 2017 and never obtained a valid MTA licence until it was forced to close in March 2020 as part of Malta’s first COVID-19 lockdown. At the time of its opening, the restaurant had obtained a temporary three-month licence allowing it to operate as a food establishment until March 2017. However, the restaurant continued to serve customers for a further three years after this temporary licence expired, without ever being granted a full licence as required by law. The auditor general’s report places much of the blame at the door of Cook & Co Ltd, highlighting how the company was responsible for obtaining the necessary permits and licences according to the site’s lease agreement. Nonetheless, the report says there is “an element of concern” in the fact that both MTA and Malta Enterprise knew that the restaurant was unlicensed all along. The issue emerged from an ongoing dispute between Cook & Co Ltd and Malta Digital Hub Ltd, the Malta Enterprise-led body that runs the Malta Life Sciences Park. In 2016 the company had won a tender to run a restaurant within the park on a site that was previously used as a childcare centre. In his report, the auditor general highlighted several “shortcomings” in the tender, the most serious of which was the failure to adequately describe the site that was being leased out.   Malta Enterprise also failed to offer bidders the opportunity to visit the site and see the property they were leasing first-hand. This, the auditor says, “detracted from the transparency of the tendering process”. Despite having never actually visited the site and only viewing it “from the outside”, Cook & Co took on the lease, only to find that the site was in a worse condition than they expected. This, they say, means that the agreement was “fraudulent” since the conditions of the site did not match what was described in the tender. The NAO report says that neither side is blameless, arguing on the one hand that Malta Enterprise had the duty to grant access to the site before the agreement was signed and, on the other, that Cook & Co shouldn’t have entered into the agreement blindly. In their submissions to the auditor, Cook & Co argued that they were unable to start operating the restaurant on September 1, 2016, as stipulated in the agreement, because the premises were inadequate and significant works were required to bring them up to scratch. The auditor notes that when works were eventually carried out, they were done without the necessary planning permits. This, in turn, meant that they were unable to obtain a licence to operate from MTA, since having planning permission in order is a prerequisite for a licence. Cook & Co also failed to pay rent throughout the years, arguing that it incurred higher costs than expected to fix the site’s “latent defects”. In total, Malta Digital Hub is claiming that they are owed €107,000 in unpaid rental and electricity fees. Malta Digital Hub eventually filed court action to evict Cook & Co from the premises in late 2020. Meanwhile, Cook & Co, which is owned by Brian Bondin and Joseph Brincat, reported Malta Digital Hub to the Rent Regulation Board, saying that it had breached the terms of the lease agreement.

'Grossly misled' PA asked to revoke permit for flats near Ġgantija Temples,Giulia Magri,"Three Gozo NGOs have applied to the Planning Board to revoke permission for a block of flats less than 200 metres away from the protected  Ġgantija temples.  The group - Din l-Art Ħelwa Għawdex, Għawdix and Wirt Għawdex - said the Planning Board was ""grossly misled"" over whether the site was in a UNESCO buffer zone. In November, the Planning Authority approved the 22-apartment block of flats and 20 basement garages in Xagħra despite a request from UNESCO for a heritage impact assessment.  During that hearing, applicants for Ġgantija Heights successfully argued that the development lies outside a buffer zone established by UNESCO to protect heritage sites. The decision meant that there was no need for a heritage impact assessment. But in the legal letter submitted to the Planning Board on Tuesday, the three NGOs said there was ""clear and unequivocal evidence"" that the development falls within the buffer zone.     RELATED STORIES  They cited Article 80 of the Development Planning Act, which gives the Planning Board the authority to revoke permission in cases of fraud, incorrect information, an error on the record or in cases of public safety. The application to revoke permission comes days before a planned Environment and Planning Review Tribunal (ERPT) hearing due on Thursday on the proposed development. Since the decision to greenlight the block of flats, the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage asked the PA to freeze the permit for the apartment block pending the outcome of a heritage impact assessment. Shortly afterward, six architects were also placed under investigation by the profession’s regulatory body for their work on projects in the area surrounding the Ġgantija temples.     RELATED STORIES  The NGOs previously warned they would fight for the revocation, as they argue the project poses a serious threat to the integrity of the temple complex and its buffer zone.
