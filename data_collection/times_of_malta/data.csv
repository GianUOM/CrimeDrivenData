Opposition wants Vitals charges included in its civil case about hospitals' deal,Edwina Brincat,"The Opposition wants criminal charges recently filed against people targeted by the Vitals inquiry to be included - as evidence - in its civil case over the state’s inaction to recover funds defrauded in the annulled hospitals’ deal. PN leader Bernard Grech filed an application on Wednesday in proceedings wherein the Opposition is claiming the State Advocate - as “the last man standing in our constitutional system” - is empowered and duty-bound to take action against present and past government officials involved in the deal. During the previous sitting, the government - as an intervenor in the suit - was granted six days to indicate any witnesses it intended to summon after requesting more time to produce evidence.  But the Opposition is now seeking the court’s permission to produce even more evidence.  News that the Vitals inquiry has been concluded emerged last week during constitutional proceedings in which former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is claiming his fundamental rights were breached through the handling of that inquiry by Magistrate Gabriella Vella.  The Registrar of the Criminal Courts testified that 78 boxes of evidence had been deposited at the court registry and handed over to the Attorney General.  Since then, prosecutors have filed criminal charges against a number of top politicians, including Muscat and others allegedly linked to the fraudulent deal.  The Opposition is now claiming that those charges - as well as an attachment and investigation order allegedly issued against a number of suspects linked to the deal - would be “useful” to the judge presiding over its case concerning the state’s inaction in recovering the defrauded funds.  Those criminal court documents were “intimately connected” to the merits of their case and not only were to be acknowledged by the judge but were also to be exhibited in evidence. Since recent developments took place after the Opposition wrapped up its evidence, the court’s authorisation was necessary for that documentation to be allowed in evidence. The Opposition therefore asked Mr Justice Toni Abela to grant it permission to summon the Registrar of the Criminal Courts to present the relative criminal charges,attachment and investigation order.  Lawyers Edward Debono and Nicholas Debono signed the application.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Man accused of trying to bite police officer after nightclub drug bust,Jessica Arena,"A 29-year-old man was remanded in custody on Wednesday after a court heard how he tried to bite the police officer who was trying to arrest him after allegedly catching him with drugs in a Ta' Qali nightclub.  Sebastian Fiedler, an oil rig worker from Żabbar, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Joseph Gatt accused of possessing cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine that was not for his personal use, violently resisting arrest and breaching bail conditions set out in a previous case, amongst others.  He pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Police inspector Francesca Calleja told the court that the incident occurred in May at a nightclub where police doing an inspection spotted the accused acting suspiciously.  As he noticed the officers approaching him, the accused dropped a sachet with traces of white powder and a €50 note from his hands to the floor, she continued.  This prompted the police to search and arrest Fiedler, during which he allegedly violently resisted the officers and attempted to bite one of them.  He was subsequently taken to the Birkirkara police station where a search of his person revealed four sachets of a substance thought to be cocaine, one sachet full of pink powder suspected to be ketamine and 24 pills of suspected ecstasy. Some €460 in cash was also found on his person. Calleja said she was subsequently informed that Fiedler is restricted under bail conditions in a separate case and police decided to search his home in Żabbar.  There, police found a butterfly knife and a switchblade, which are illegal to own in Malta.  As the police and the defence went over the circumstances of the arrest, some confusion arose as to whether the drugs retrieved from the accused were found on his person or not.  Lawyer Franco Debono said that according to his Fiedler, the sachets and pills were found on the floor of the nightclub, where many other people were.  But Calleja vehemently denied this version of events, insisting that the substances found had been pulled out of Fiedler’s pockets by the police.  “He dropped the first sachet, which only contained traces, to the ground and started to push it with his foot,” she said.  “It was when he was escorted to the police station that he was searched properly and the drugs were found on him,” Calleja added, as Fiedler shook his head in the negative.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution, who said that the seriousness of the charges was underscored by the fact it was committed at a place frequented by youths. Furthermore, the man had been accused of a crime while under separate bail conditions, proving he was not trustworthy or able to abide by set conditions, particularly when he tried to injure a police officer, Calleja said.  Debono countered by saying that, while the defence was still contesting the manner in which the drugs were found, the amounts were nonetheless small and Fiedler had not been accused of trafficking.  He also pointed out that between his arrest and arraignment on Wednesday, the police had seen fit to grant the accused police bail while they continued to investigate and he had no problem abiding by conditions set during this time.  “Here the court has concrete proof that when he was trusted by the police inspector with police bail, he obeyed,” Debono said.  Fiedler, he said, has successfully completed drug court after getting into trouble with the law a few years ago. Since then he had completely turned his life around, having a job a stable relationship and a child, Debono said. The knives found in his possession, Debono continued, once belonged to the accused’s Swiss father, who collected Swiss knives. They had been found under Fiedler’s bed where they had been for many years.  Debono also pointed out there were no civilian witnesses to testify in this case and all evidence had already been captured by police body cams.  After hearing submissions, the court decided that, due to the nature of the crimes, it would be too early to grant Fiedler bail. He rejected the request and remanded him in custody.  He also granted a protection order in favour of the police officer involved in the arrest.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Man accused of raping former partner, tracking her car denied bail",Jessica Arena,"A man was charged with raping his former partner on Wednesday after the woman disclosed that she had been assaulted while reporting a campaign of harassment to the police.  Technician Mathihul Akmal Mohamed Jabir, 32, who is a Sri Lankan national residing in Gżira, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Joseph Gatt and accused of raping his partner while they were in a relationship as well as harassing her, spying on her and causing her to fear violence, among other charges.  Jabir pleaded not guilty.  Police inspector John Spiteri told court that on March 19 the woman reported her ex-boyfriend for harassment and stalking.  While speaking to police officers and describing the behaviour that she had allegedly suffered at the hands of the accused, she disclosed that on one occasion, on February 24, she had been “forced to engage in sexual conduct against her will”.  Subsequently, police attempted to arrest the accused, but it turned out that Jabir was already airborne, having boarded a flight to his native Sri Lanka.  Upon discovering that the accused was due to fly back to Malta on Wednesday morning, he was apprehended at the airport upon arrival.  Objecting to a request for bail, Spiteri said that, aside from the gravity of the charges and civilian witnesses having yet to testify, Jabir posed a real threat of absconding not only because he has minimal ties to Malta but because the country also has no bilateral agreements with Sri Lanka. Should he leave the island for good, the court has no assurance that justice will be done, he said.  Additionally, Spiteri said there was still a fear that he could interfere with witnesses, particularly as the alleged victim herself is still to testify, and Jabir has been accused of installing a tracking device in her car.  Making a case for bail, defence lawyer Joseph Calleja Parnis said that while the most serious crime of rape is being used in the charges as being grave enough to deny bail, the victim herself had not approached police about the incident in question and it had only come up as a “side note”.  While the alleged rape had occurred on February 24, she only went to the police on March 19, he pointed out.  “If she was really serious about reporting this rape, it's something you go and report there and then or the next day and not a month later,” he said.  Other than that, the most serious concern to be considered was harassment and Jabir should not be denied bail on a harassment charge, his lawyer argued.  The accused has adequate ties to Malta, a steady job and a residence card and should not be denied bail for being a foreigner, Calleja Parnis added.  He had gone to Sri Lanka to visit his family and also because he was going through a rough time with his partner, the lawyer said, adding that he had returned to Malta of his own volition because he was due in court this morning in a district sitting related to the same circumstances.  Spiteri countered the defence’s claims, saying the situation was already very difficult for the alleged victim to deal with.  “Marital rape or rape within a relationship is already very hard to report from the onset,” he said adding that she had been driven to file a report because she was “fed up” and could no longer handle the accused’s behaviour towards her.  After hearing submissions, Magistrate Gatt ruled that it would be “unwise” to grant bail at this stage given the gravity of the charges and because the court was not convinced that Jabir was capable of adhering to bail conditions.  He also granted a protection order in favour of the alleged victim.  AG Lawyer Cynthia Tomasuolo and police inspectors Sherona Buhagiar and John Spiteri prosecuted.  Lawyer Joseph Calleja Parnis appeared for the accused. Lawyers Jacob Magri and Arthur Azzopardi appeared parte civile on behalf of the alleged victim.

"Fearne, Scicluna and others to be charged with fraud over hospitals scandal",Bertrand Borg,"Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna, three top civil servants and nine others are to face charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain in connection with the hospitals' deal, Times of Malta can reveal. Malta’s deputy prime minister and central bank governor are among a group of 14 people and two companies listed in a second charge sheet related to the Vitals deal that was filed in court on Monday. The second group of people charged in connection with the deal do not stand accused of having taken bribes or trading in influence, though they still face serious charges.  The list – which is separate to one that features Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri and others – includes lawyers, civil servants and people who served on the adjudication committee that awarded the lucrative deal to run three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare. It lists two former permanent secretaries, Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, and a current one in Ronald Mizzi, adjudication committee members James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna and Robert Borg, financial controller Kenneth Deguara and five lawyers: Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, Deborah Anne Chappell and Bradley Gatt. Also cited is law firm DF Advocates, which is led by Kevin Deguara and Farrugia with Kenneth Deguara as its Chief Financial Officer, and its sister firm DF Corporate Advisory. The firm served as legal advisers to Vitals as well its medical supplier Technoline and was raided by police in 2021. The charge sheet adds to a political earthquake that has rocked Malta's political establishment.  Suspicions about the deal to privatise three state hospitals led to multiple investigations and court cases.  In 2020, the National Audit Office concluded that Vitals should have been disqualified from the deal altogether. In 2023, a civil court annulled the entire deal following a case filed by then-Opposition leader Adrian Delia.  Now, a years-long magisterial inquiry into ministerial crimes has culminated in criminal charges for some of Malta’s highest-profile politicians. It remains unclear on what basis prosecutors have charged all those cited, as that inquiry remains under wraps. Prime Minister Robert Abela has sought to dismiss the inquiry that triggered the charges as politically motivated.  But while he has implied that he has full faith in Fearne and will not be sacking him, the criminal charges are likely to derail the deputy prime minister's plans of becoming an EU Commissioner later this year. Similarly, it is unclear how central bank governor Scicluna will be able to sit on the European Central Bank’s governing council while also defending himself from criminal charges of fraud. All those cited are to be charged with fraud amounting to over €5,000 and having made fraudulent gains. Fearne, Scicluna, Camilleri, Mizzi, Rapa and Chappell will also face charges of misappropriation. The three top civil servants will also face charges of having committed crimes they were duty-bound to prevent. Chappell, who served as Vitals' in-house legal counsel, the Deguaras and Jean Carl Farrugia will also face money laundering charges. Kevin Deguara, Farrugia, Chappell, Castagna and Mifsud Bonnici, who is close to Konrad Mizzi, face charges of having actively participated in a criminal activity and criminal association. Chappell and Kenneth Deguara will answer to charges of document fraud, including documents related to VAT. Those accused will be arraigned before Magistrate Rachel Montebello at an as-yet unspecified date.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

From preliminary searches, the police said the man’s face was covered and allegedly was armed with a knife. The thief demanded cash from the 36-year-old Albanian employee. The alleged thief fled the scene after stealing an amount of cash. The employee was not injured. Magistrate Joseph Mifsud has been informed about the case and an inquiry has been launched.

Man facing 700g heroin charge granted bail,Times of Malta,"A man facing charges in connection with a 700g heroin bust has been granted bail. Pierre Cremona, 56, was driving a car that was searched by police and found to contain sachets of heroin. Officers then searched a Mosta house where they found Cremona’s 24-year-old son and a bag containing 700g of the drug. Cremona, his son and a man who was accompanying him in the car were all arrested and charged with heroin possession not intended for their personal use. Late last month, the car’s passenger, Stefano Montebello, walked away a free man after a court declared his arrest null and void. Montebello’s lawyers proved that prosecutors had failed to obtain a warrant for his arrest and failed to inform him about the reason he was being arrested. Cremona's son, Owen, was also granted bail upon arraignment.  This week, a court heard the testimony of various police officers involved in the drug bust. At the end of the hearing and following a request by his lawyers, magistrate Elaine Rizzo agreed to grant Cremona bail against a €5,000 deposit and €10,000 personal guarantee. He must also sign a bail book daily at Qormi police station and remain indoors between 9pm and 6am, the court decreed. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit are representing Cremona.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Muscat on the warpath: ‘Those who did not fix this injustice will be judged',Times of Malta,"Joseph Muscat lashed out on Monday following news that he is to face criminal charges, saying the police and attorney general had breached his right to a fair hearing. Muscat noted that he had not been questioned by investigators before charges against him and others were filed in court. He described that as an “obscenity and abomination”.  “Those who dirtied themselves with this injustice or looked the other way instead of fixing it will be judged harshly by the people in the short-term, justice in the long run and by history forever,” Muscat wrote on Facebook.   Several Labour insiders told Times of Malta those words appeared to be a veiled attack on Prime Minister Robert Abela and his ministers. It is unusual for prosecutors to file criminal charges against suspects without having first questioned them, criminal lawyers told Times of Malta. They said it is also unusual for people charged with crimes related to fraud or money laundering to be arraigned through a court summons, rather than under arrest. Suspects arraigned under summons are free to return home after they plead not guilty and do not have to request bail. Times of Malta reported on Monday that prosecutors from the office of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg have filed criminal charges against Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri and more than a dozen other individuals and companies. They are suspected of having committed crimes in connection with the now-annulled deal to privatise three state hospitals. That deal was negotiated and signed by the Muscat government and annulled by a civil court last year, which found that it was tainted by fraud and that top government officials had colluded against the national interest in the way they handled it. A magisterial inquiry that was tasked with assessing whether Muscat, his ministers and top officials committed crimes in connection with the deal was concluded last week. Muscat has spent the past year battling the inquiry process, saying the magistrate that led it is biased and out to get him. Last week, he said the state’s institutions “are working against Labourites”. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Vitals inquiry: AG files charges against Muscat, Mizzi, Schembri and others",Times of Malta,"Updated 4.05pm Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri are among roughly 19 individuals and companies named in criminal charges filed on Monday concerning the scandal-racked deal to privatise three state hospitals. Times of Malta understands the former prime minister, his chief staff and ex-senior minister are to be arraigned under summons, not arrest – meaning they will be expected to appear in court on the date of their arraignment and that they will be able to return home following their arraignment.  Sources said the charges were filed in court on Monday afternoon by three lawyers from the office of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg.  Individuals and companies to be charged have been divided into three lots, though it remains unclear which crimes have been cited on each of those lots. Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri are understood to feature in the first of those three charge sheets, along with a number of others.  Repubblika’s honorary president Robert Aquilina told Times of Malta that he received confirmation from Buttigieg’s office via email that all the people mentioned by the inquiring magistrate will be charged. The inquiry, which was led by Magistrate Gabriella Vella and tasked with determining whether Muscat, his ministers or top officials committed crimes in connection with the deal to hand three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, was completed 10 days ago. Muscat immediately said the inquiry was a “political vendetta” and that he expected to be charged. Others believed to have been involved, including Mizzi, Schembri and Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, have not commented. Chris Fearne, Malta's nominee to the European Commission and who is also believed to be among  those cited in the inquiry, has insisted he had nothing to hide.  Vitals was a company with no history of business and exited the privatisation deal after a few years, handing over operations to US healthcare giants Steward Health Care.  But Steward also did not honour contractual obligations, and last year a court annulled the deal on the basis of fraud. Steward - which is locked in a dispute with the government over a €100m exit fee it says it is owed - filed for bankruptcy in the US earlier on Monday. In a Facebook post, Joseph Muscat noted that police had not questioned him before charges were filed.   ""This is no longer just a vendetta, it is disgusting and an abomination. Tens of people's lives are being tossed into a bureaucratic dump for years, just to suit others,"" he wrote.  ""Anyone who is involved in this injustice or who looked the other way instead of trying to fix it will be judged harshly by the people, justice and history,"" Muscat said.    With the attorney general having now filed criminal charges in court, it is up to the judiciary to manage the next steps in the process.   The criminal charges that have been filed will be handled by the court registrar, who will allocate them to a magistrate at random, by lot.  RELATED STORIES  Whichever magistrate is assigned the case will then set a date for arraignment and notify the accused of the charges they face, and the date when the arraignments will take place. The inquiry that triggered the AG to file criminal charges remains secret, though Opposition leader Bernard Grech has said that it is clear that Prime Minister Robert Abela has a copy and is using it for his own political ends.

Wanted Romanian prince claims extradition would breach his rights,Edwina Brincat,"Lawyers for a Romanian prince battling extradition before the Maltese courts claimed on Monday the request by the Romanian authorities was based on a corrupt decision which, if executed, would result in a breach of fundamental rights.  Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei, the 75-year-old member of the Romanian royal family, fled Romania in 2020 following his conviction for corruption related to the illegal restitution of real estate near Bucharest, to which authorities said he falsely claimed ownership.  He was sentenced to a prison term of three years and four months.  The prince was taken into police custody just over a week ago while attending an event in Malta.  Upon arraignment last Monday, he did not consent to the extradition and was remanded in custody. A former French prosecutor and academic who was also actively involved in several EU anti-corruption missions testified via videoconference at the extradition proceedings. Describing the matter as “scandalous,” retired magistrate Serge Mackowiak said that he had met the prince a couple of times in the presence of his legal advisors. Following a detailed overview of the historical, political and legal saga surrounding the prince, the witness concluded that the European Arrest Warrant was null. The reasons were threefold.  That warrant was a result of political persecution, while the whole dispute stemmed from a Nazi edict dated 1941 which ordered the illegal confiscation of the royal family’s property. Moreover, the Romanian court that ordered the prince’s extradition was not lawfully constituted because two of the judges who ordered the extradition did not take the oath of allegiance.  A US attorney who assisted the prince for the past 12 years and who is also following the extradition case in Malta, also testified on Monday.  Besides seeking to overturn the prince’s 2020 conviction, lawyer Edward Griffin had also filed a case before the European Court of Human Rights. That case was still pending.  The prince’s conviction in Romania violated his right to a fair trial, due process and family rights, Griffin said. “They [Romanian authorities] say he is not the legitimate heir of Carol II. That’s ridiculous because so far all courts all over Europe held that he is the legitimate heir,” said Griffin. After the fall of the Communist regime, Prince Paul and his father returned to Romania to reclaim family property.  But they were met with the argument that even if entitled to the property, that property was not confiscated by the communist state but by the Nazis.  While the property feud continued, in 2022 Prince Paul was targeted by an EAW in Paris.  The Paris Court of Appeal turned down the request, citing “systematic deficiencies” in the Romanian judicial system.  That conclusion was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation. The French courts refused to hand over the wanted person, pointing out a “real risk” that his fundamental rights would be violated.  The original official texts of those French judgments were presented in evidence by a lawyer from the Attorney General’s Office and a court expert was tasked to compare the originals to their English translation. When the hearing resumed after a few hours break, the expert reported that “on the whole, it [the translation] was very faithful, save for some typing mistakes, not semantic errors"". There was, however, one significant factor that was subsequently highlighted by the defence.  The judgment of the Romanian court stated the prince was “present” before that court on December 18, 2020.  “Do you remember where you were on that date,” asked defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, as the prince briefly took the witness stand.  “I was in Portugal in front of a Portuguese judge to be declared administrator of my grandfather’s succession,” testified Prince Paul.  That meant that the Romantian court had “lied” when declaring that the prince was “present” and the EAW was then based on that lie, argued Azzopardi.  Moreover, the Romanian court was not lawfully constituted.  The French courts had refused to surrender the prince and a similar “diffusion” request channelled through Interpol, also failed.  Last year, retention of data about the prince was stated to be not legal because it did not comply with Interpol’s rules and was consequently to be “purged” from Interpol’s system.  A report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture within the Council of Europe concluded that the situation in any Romanian prison “is definitely inhuman and degrading treatment”, added Azzopardi, citing a number of cases to support that argument. Defence lawyer Jose’ Herrera observed further that a court deciding an extradition request is endowed with “special powers” in terms of article 4 of the Framework Decision on European Arrest Warrants. Such a court has the power to go beyond ordinary legislation and also consider fundamental rights issues. The court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, deferred the case for judgment next week.  Meanwhile, a separate application for bail was still pending.  The defence had filed a request at 9.15am on the day before the hearing. But their application reached the Magistrate’s chamber at 3.16pm.  That delay, attributed by the prince’s lawyers to the courts’ administrative system, was “unacceptable”.  It meant that the AG had not yet filed a reply about bail by the time the hearing got underway. The wanted person was “reliable and trustworthy”, had fully cooperated with investigators and could offer a fixed address for bail purposes.  “If need be he can sign [the bail book] every three hours,” argued Azzopardi, appealing to “justice and humanity”. “He has been hounded for many years” and was in preventive custody since his arrest last week.  The court directed the defence to indicate by means of a note a third party who could step in as surety for bail purposes, before deciding upon the matter. Inspector Roderick Spiteri prosecuted. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Jose’ Herrera, Kris Busietta and Martina Herrera were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Teenager who assaulted German MEP turns himself in,AFP,"A 17-year-old has turned himself in to police in Germany after an attack on a lawmaker that the country's leaders decried as a threat to democracy.   The teenager reported to police in the eastern city of Dresden early Sunday morning and said he was ""the perpetrator who had knocked down the SPD politician"", police said in a statement. Matthias Ecke, 41, European parliament lawmaker for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was set upon by four attackers as he put up EU election posters in Dresden on Friday night, according to police. Ecke was ""seriously injured"" and required an operation after the attack, his party said. Scholz on Saturday condemned the attack as a threat to democracy. ""We must never accept such acts of violence,"" he said. Ecke, who is head of the SPD's European election list in the Saxony region, was just the latest political target to be attacked in Germany. Police said a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been ""punched"" and ""kicked"" earlier in the evening on the same Dresden street.  Last week two Greens deputies were abused while campaigning in Essen in western Germany and another was surrounded by dozens of demonstrators in her car in the east of the country.  According to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023, up from 1,806 the previous year, but less than the 2,840 recorded in 2021, when legislative elections took place. A group of activists against the far right has called for demonstrations against the attack on Ecke in Dresden and Berlin on Sunday, Der Spiegel magazine said. According to the Tagesspiegel newspaper, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser is planning to call a special conference with Germany's regional interior ministers next week to address violence against politicians.

Banners for two separate MEP candidates removed without explanation,Times of Malta,"Updated 9.50am Banners promoting two separate MEP candidates were taken down and stolen this weekend, the candidates said.  Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola said banners he had installed in Mġarr, Gozo and Xewkija both vanished between Friday and Saturday.  Banners promoting Nationalist Party MEP candidate Peter Agius in Marsascala and Xemxija also mysteriously disappeared, Agius said separately.  Cassola said that he had filed a police report in Victoria about the banners' removal. “Apart from revealing that certain cowards still exist in our country, this episode fills me with great courage,” Cassola said in a statement.   “There are those who are in strong fear that, on June 8 next, the 58-year PNPL duopoly is going to implode and a third Maltese voice is going to enter the European Parliament for the first time.” The two banners were hung in Mġarr and Xewkija and encouraged voters to “cast a vote for integrity” by voting for Cassola.  In a police report he filed on Saturday evening, Cassola told Victoria police that he knew the banners were still in place on Friday. He encouraged officers to use footage from CCTV cameras in their vicinity to identify the culprits.  Cassola told Times of Malta that a fellow MEP candidate alerted him to the banners' sudden disappearance. He discovered that his banners were missing shortly after Peter Agius reported the disappearance of his own banners.    ""These banners were installed legally and are an important way for us to be able to reach voters, given that PBS is controlled by the Labour Party and the government is dishing out cheques on the eve of an election,"" Agius wrote.  ""I will not be intimidated by vandals and will continue to work day and night to be there for you.""  Cassola, an academic and activist who has been involved in local politics for decades, is campaigning on a platform focused on environmental issues, good governance and social justice. Among the 39 candidates running for MEP in the June 8 elections, he is the most experienced, having contested every MEP election in Maltese history. In 2004 – Malta’s first-ever MEP elections – Cassola won almost 25,000 votes, representing Alternattiva Demokratika. He would go on to contest two more MEP elections as an AD candidate before quitting the party and running as an independent in 2019.  Agius, who is a lawyer by profession, served as head of the European Parliament office in Malta and then within the secretariat of then-EP president Antonio Tajani. He first ran for an MEP seat in 2019. Polls suggest he is well-placed to obtain a seat in the June 8 elections.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Benefits racket fraudsters eligible for pardon only if money is paid back,Times of Malta,"Only people who have paid back their ill-gotten gains related to the benefits racket will be considered for a presidential pardon, the Government clarified in a statement on Saturday.  This comes after the case against many of the people implicated in the scandal had to be adjourned on Thursday after several lawyers expressed they felt they did not have enough information to advise their clients on the way forward in light of the announcement of the pardon.  Criminal cases have been brought against hundreds of people who received a monetary benefit intended for people with severe disabilities which they did not suffer from.  It has since been announced that a presidential pardon will be granted to such people after it came to light that many who had become tangled up in the racket were genuinely sick, poor or needed the money.  Prime Minister Robert Abela has appealed to the public not the downplay the trauma of people involved some of whom are vulnerable and facing other social problems. However, the pardon does come with caveats, namely that those accused will have to pay back all of the money they weren't entitled to and will have to testify in court in order to get the crime struck off their police conduct.  The government said that the people implicated in the racket would be eligible for a presidential pardon if they were found guilty of crimes related to the fraudulent scheme as of January 1, 2022, if they are currently facing criminal charges or if it is possible for them to be charged criminally based on these same circumstances, that is having received this benefit while not being entitled to it.  RELATED STORIES  Anyone suspected of masterminding the scheme or instigating and promoting it in any way will not be eligible to be pardoned, they stressed.  For one to be considered for the pardon, they must first make a request to the director of Social Security through their legal representative. The person must also confirm that they intend to pay back the money or provide information about how they plan to make repayments.  After it is verified that the money has been paid, or the person enters into a written agreement to return the money through a repayment plan, then the request for a pardon can be passed on the the Police Commissioner and the Justice Ministry. The latter will then be able to confirm the issuance of the pardon to the applicant. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Man wanted by FBI for selling malware 'appeared normal', prosecutors tell court",Edwina Brincat,"A Maltese man who says he should not be extradited to the United States because he was in a mentally poor state when he was first charged appeared to behave “normally”, police prosecutors have testified.  Daniel Meli, 27, is wanted by the FBI for allegedly selling illegal malware on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022.  He was arrested in February at his home and initially agreed to be extradited to the US to face criminal charges there.  But he subsequently appealed the decision, claiming that the court did not assure that he was in a sufficiently sound state of mind when expressing consent.  His lawyers are arguing before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction that his right to a fair hearing was breached. A number of medical professionals were summoned to testify about his mental health issues throughout the years.  A documented history of mental health struggles emerged, with doctors describing Meli as a “very bright 26-year old” who had long suffered “great social anxiety.” He had a past history of drug abuse and more recently, had turned to abuse of prescription drugs.  When the case resumed this week, two police officers testified about Meli’s behaviour in the hours preceding his arraignment.  Superintendent and lawyer Mario Cuschieri from the police International Relations Unit first spoke to Meli on the day of his arraignment at around 11:15am.  His involvement was limited to executing the arrest warrant issued by a magistrate for extradition purposes.  “He appeared normal. Quiet. When asked several times if he understood, he said ‘yes’,” said Cuschieri, when asked to describe Meli’s behaviour.  When police explained to him the implications of the US international arrest warrant “ he never flagged any problem in understanding what we were saying.” He spoke to his lawyer before facing charges and upon arraignment, indicated more than once that he was consenting to the extradition.  “He [Meli] appeared to understand what was going on,” said Cuschieri.  Questioned by Meli’s new lawyer lawyers, Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono, Cuschieri clarified that he was not involved in tracking down and arresting the suspect. He had only executed the arrest warrant at police headquarters.  Meli was given his legal rights both verbally and in writing and was given documentation sent by the US competent authorities.  The wanted man was arrested on February 7, but Cuschieri spoke to him the following day.  “What did you do to make sure that he was not under shock and conscious?” asked Azzopardi.  “I didn’t interrogate Meli,” replied Cuschieri, pointing out that cybercrime officers had arrested and interrogated the suspect.  “At no point did he express doubt about not understanding. We spoke Maltese,” said Inspector Robinson Mifsud, Interpol liaising officer who also executed the international arrest warrant. “We assured that he understood why he was wanted in the US.”  Meli’s behaviour was “basically normal” even during his arraignment. “The court gave him time to reconsider but at no point did he appear anxious or tearful….he was clear.” Asked by Meli’s lawyer whether he was specialized in psychology or psychiatry or any other medical field, the inspector’s reply was, “no.” Logs of Meli’s ‘movements’ while in police custody were exhibited in court.  He was arrested on February 7 at 7:45am and taken to the custody centre at 5:00pm. According to routine procedure, his personal details were recorded and he was given all rights, including the right to see a doctor and a lawyer.  Meli declined the right to medical assistance but told officers that he was due for a visit at the detox centre. He expressed the wish to speak to a close relative and later spoke to his personal lawyer on the phone between 8:02pm and 8:32pm. Later that evening, he was accompanied to the Floriana health centre. The next day, he paid another visit to detox and then faced interrogation between 9:00am and noon.  Meli was released for arraignment at 2:25pm, said inspector Antoine Cilia who gave an overview of the police logs which were presented in evidence.  State Advocate lawyer Julian Farrugia drew attention to a story published by MaltaToday on February 10, titled, ‘FBI wanted Maltese hacker extradited over sale of Pegasus, Warzone Trojans.’ Meli’s former lawyer was reported as stating that the wanted person “was motivated by a mindset of cooperation and facing down the charges…,” summing up his client’s attitude as “‘since we’re going to have to face it, let’s get it done.’” The author of that story was summoned by the State Advocate.  He could not recall whether Meli's former lawyer had sought his client's permission before giving them those comments to the media. The case, presided over by Madam Justice Doreen Clarke, continues. State Advocate lawyer Julian Farrugia represented the respondents. Lawyers Franco Debono and Arthur Azzopardi are assisting Meli.

"Thief who stole gold medals had no idea they were worth €400,000, lawyer says",Edwina Brincat,"A man who stole two gold medals valued at €400,000 from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa, “never imagined what they were worth,” his lawyer argued in court this week after his client admitted to the crime.  Justin Mallia, the 25-year-old Cospicua resident, was arrested in March, hours after two very rare 19th-century medals went missing from the museum. He had only been out on bail for a few days when he was targeted as the prime suspect behind the theft.  Mallia, who was well known among police circles, was clearly identified on CCTV footage linking him to the theft of the precious artifacts.  Police said he managed to slip into the museum by posing as an education official delivering documents while an event for schoolchildren was taking place. According to Heritage Malta, the medals or coins were awarded between 1800 and 1801 to leaders and distinguished members of the National Congress battalions who fought to liberate Malta from French rule. The suspected thief was tracked down within hours and arrested at his home. He handed over a pouch containing the stolen medals when police knocked at his door. When questioned, he told officers that he had stolen the medals to settle some pending debts.  On March 19, Mallia was charged with aggravated theft, unlawful possession of the medals which were government property as well as defrauding the Maritime Museum. He was also charged with allegedly breaching three previous bail decrees.  Mallia initially pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody.  Prosecuting Inspector Paul Camilleri told the court that the medals had suffered “irreversible damage” because they brushed against other items inside the pouch where Mallia had placed them.  When the case continued this week, Mallia changed his plea and registered an admission. Since proceedings were still at an early stage and Mallia had cooperated with investigators, AG lawyer Etienne Savona explained that the prosecution would not insist on a maximum punishment.   RELATED STORIES  A five-year effective jail term would be appropriate, argued the prosecution. That punishment did not appear to be contested by defence lawyer Joseph Brincat who pointed out further that the stolen medals had been retrieved on the day of the accused’s arrest.  “Never did he imagine what they were worth,”[Qatt ma kien jobsor x’valur għandħom] the lawyer said when making submissions on punishment. The court, presided by Magistrate Nadine Lia, deferred the case for judgment.  AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Alessia Schembri prosecuted together with Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Antonello Magri.

"Tile layer charged with attacking man in Paola released, arrest declared invalid",Edwina Brincat,"A tile layer charged with attacking a man at a Paola residence on Thursday was released from custody on Friday after his arrest was declared invalid.  Mohammed Hamza, a 37-year-old Libyan national, was charged with attempting to place the life of his alleged victim in manifest danger but willingly stopped the attack.  He was also charged with causing grievous bodily harm and wilfully breaching the public peace.  Before he pleaded to the charges, his lawyers contested the validity of the arrest.  Court was told that at around 9.30am on Thursday, a man entered the Paola police station wearing a blood-stained top and with blood on his hands and face. He sat down in a chair and an officer asked whether he needed medical help.  But the man - later identified as Mohammed - replied: ""not me. Someone else"". The blood was not his but someone else's with whom he had just argued, the man added.  Meanwhile, a second report came in about a man who needed help.  He had been assaulted with a sledgehammer and a sharp tile layer's tool.  The victim told the police that he had been attacked by a ""certain Mohammed"". The constable at the police station, acting under instructions of a sergeant, informed Mohammed that he was under arrest, explained prosecuting Inspector Keith Rizzo.  The duty magistrate was informed of the arrest at 11am. The defence pounced on that information to challenge the validity of the arrest citing article 355AD(i) of the Criminal Code. ""The law speaks clearly,"" argued lawyer Jacob Magri.  In case of voluntary attendance at a police station, the arrest must be authorised by an inspector and the duty magistrate must be informed ""immediately"", he added. The prosecuting inspector said he had been told of the arrest ""within minutes"". But after hearing further submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declared that the arrest was not in line with the law.  The accused was released from arrest.  He then pleaded not guilty.  The court upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the victim.  In view of the gravity of the charges, the fact that the victim was still to testify and the risk of absconding, the court upheld the prosecution's request for conditions to be imposed on the accused, although there was no bail. The court ordered the accused not to approach any prosecution witnesses, to attend all court sittings, not to abscond and to bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000. AG lawyer Kaylie Bonnet and Inspector Keith Rizzo prosecuted.  Lawyers Alfred Abela, Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri and Rebecca Mercieca were defence counsel.

Man denied bail after grievously injuring partner at their Birkirkara home,Edwina Brincat,"A man was charged with grievously injuring his partner, assaulting her, insulting and threatening her.  He was further charged with harassment, causing her to fear violence and wilfully breaching the public peace.  The assault allegedly took place in the couple's Birkirkara home on Wednesday.  On Thursday morning the woman went for an errand at a nearby pet shop and later stopped at a bar to buy cigarettes. People at the shop and at the bar noticed her facial injuries and alerted the police.  Officers went to the bar and the woman was taken to hospital by ambulance while her partner was arrested.  Upon arraignment on Friday, the 35-year-old pleaded not guilty.  His lawyer Martin Fenech rebutted the allegations, saying that the alleged victim had injured herself in a fall. ""It was her fault,"" he said. A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution because the victim was still to testify. They said there was great fear of tampering with evidence, while the nature of the offences was serious.  In light of those submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request for bail and upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the victim.  The court also upheld a request for a ban on the victim's name to avoid re-victimisation.  AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli and Inspector Colin Sheldon prosecuted.

Iklin pawnbroker admits handling stolen Grand Master's Palace artefacts,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 10.30am A pensioner running a pawnbroker's shop was on Friday charged with possession of antique vases and a clock stolen from Valletta's Grand Master's Palace. Anthony, also known as Tony Stivala, 67, from Iklin, admitted to handling stolen property, knowing that the items were cultural property belonging to the government of Malta. Police traced the items to his home on Thursday. They were found wrapped in towels and in ""perfect condition"", court was told. Stivala said that he was not aware they were stolen.  On Friday he pleaded guilty, confirming his plea after being given ample time to reconsider. He was declared guilty and handed a two-year jail term suspended for four years.  His defence lawyer declared that there would be no appeal.  Stivala is the second person to be charged over the theft and is expected to testify against an architect involved in the restoration of the palace and who is believed to have stolen the artefacts.  Last month, Ljubica Zivkovic, 52, from Serbia, denied charges of aggravated theft, unlawful possession of the cultural artefacts acquired illegally and breaching probation for similar offences. The architect, who also lives in Iklin, was a project manager who worked for a restoration company involved in works at the palace, according to sources. She joined in the last six months of the project, handling last-minute civil works.  Prosecuting Inspector Christina Delia informed the court that of the four items allegedly stolen from the palace only three had been retrieved. The fourth item - a 20th-century vase worth some €300 - was still missing.  When making submissions on punishment, his lawyer Roberto Spiteri, explained that the crime was only committed when Stivala heard about the theft in the media and failed to step forward.  Perhaps because he never had a brush with the law, Stivala erred on the side of caution, choosing not to disclose the items to police “so as not to inflate the matter”.  But he had now learnt his lesson.  Court was told that Stivala’s children had prepared some forms to be filled in by customers taking items to the pawn shop, declaring that they were not stolen property.  Unfortunately, their father had been “negligent” in using those forms, remarked the lawyer.  It was not the first time people took antiques to his shop for a valuation or as pawns. The alleged author of the theft - Zivkovic - had been to his shop several times.  The prosecutor said that the total value of the stolen items was €13,000 less some €350 of the still missing vase.  But AG lawyer Nicholas Degaetano argued that since that value was calculated by Heritage Malta and not court experts, the value was “doubtful”.  Prosecuting Inspector Delia pointed out that the value was forwarded in Heritage Malta’s report.  After hearing submissions on punishment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declared the accused guilty. Upon delivery of judgment, the court warned the accused to be careful because “it’s obvious that you’re not understanding what you are facing”. “I'll just close shop and stay at home in peace,” the soft-spoken man said, nodding in understanding.  AG lawyer Nicholas Degaetano, together with Inspectors Christina Delia, Jeffrey Rizzo and Debra Camilleri for the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage prosecuted.

Simshar survivor cleared after his brother forgives him for assault,Matthew Xuereb,"The sole survivor of the 2008 Simshar tragedy has been spared jail over a domestic violence incident with his brother who refused to testify against him in court, stalling criminal proceedings. Simon Bugeja, 50, from Marsaxlokk, was cleared of seriously injuring his brother during an altercation in December 2022 after the prosecution’s main witness refused to testify against his brother. Bugeja made headlines in July 2008 when he survived seven days at sea without food and water after an explosion on his fishing vessel, Simshar. The tragedy left four people dead: Bugeja’s father, Karmenu, 61; Noel Carabott, 33; Somali Abdulrahman Abdala Gedi, 21, while the body of Bugeja’s 11-year-old son, Theo, was never found.   Bugeja was arrested in December 2022 shortly after a physical altercation with his brother, Marvin, outside their shared block of flats in Marsaxlokk. Police Inspector Sherona Buhagiar told the court that Marvin was the first to file a police report against his brother, telling the police that Simon had assaulted him with floor tiles. He claimed that he had to use a wooden pallet he found on the ground to defend himself from the attack. He suffered serious injuries to his hand in the assault.  He told the police that his mother had demolished her house and built a block of apartments, with the mother, the two brothers, and the mason taking one apartment each. On the day of the incident, while workers were on site, Simon Bugeja turned up and was angry at him because he usually took care of these things himself. He wanted to send the workers away. According to Marvin Bugeja, his brother suddenly aggressively turned towards him with floor tiles in his hand, telling him that he was not intimidated by him, and assaulted him with the tiles. The physical fight continued until workers and passers-by separated the two brothers. When an arrest warrant was obtained and Simon Bugeja was arrested, he told police it was his brother who had assaulted him, hurling the wooden pallet at him. He too had suffered injuries, which were classified as being of a slight nature.  RELATED STORIES  When proceedings continued last week before Magistrate Nadine Lia, Marvin Bugeja refused to testify against his brother, telling the court that it was an isolated incident that never happened again since and that he had forgiven his brother. The court declared the proceedings extinguished due to lack of evidence and Simon Bugeja not guilty of the charges brought against him.

Twins back in court for threatening elderly parents over drug money,Edwina Brincat,"Twin brothers were remanded in custody on Wednesday after pleading not guilty to violence against their elderly parents, just over a month since being granted bail over similar charges.  The two 39-year old siblings, whose names are not being published to protect the identity of their alleged victims, landed back in court after police received fresh information that the brothers were once again pestering their parents for money.  The pair, who told the court that they were currently unemployed, allegedly wanted the money to fuel their drug addiction. When their parents refused to hand over money, their sons allegedly turned violent.  Both siblings had been arraigned over domestic violence charges in March and were subsequently granted bail later that month.  But since then, they allegedly returned to bad ways, constantly asking their parents for money and using violence against the elderly couple when their requests were turned down.  On Wednesday the brothers were charged with violence against their parents, causing the elderly victims to fear violence, insults and threats as well as breaching bail conditions.  They pleaded not guilty.  Their legal aid lawyer said that the father had filed a false report and argued that this was a case of revenge.  But the prosecution strongly objected to the request for bail, rebutting the defence’s claim that this was a false report.  After hearing submissions by both parties the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request and remanded the twins in custody.  The court also issued a Protection Order in favour of the accused’s parents.  Inspectors Omar Zammit and Christian Cauchi prosecuted.

Three injured in apparent stabbing at UK school: police,AFP,"A 17-year-old boy was arrested on Wednesday for attempted murder after three people were injured in an apparent stabbing at a school in northern England, police said, days after a similar incident in Wales. The boy was detained following reports of three people being injured at Birley Community College in Sheffield, South Yorkshire Police said. Officers responded to reports of an incident ""involving a sharp object"" at around 8.50 am. Two adults were checked at the scene after suffering minor injuries, the force said in a statement. A child was also checked over after being assaulted, it added. None of them required hospital treatment. The school later said that it went into lockdown following the violence, before closing for the day. ""The safety of students and staff is paramount and all students and staff are safe,"" said a spokesperson for the school. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that she was ""disturbed"" by the incident. ""We're in touch with the school and my thoughts are with those injured and all the school community affected by this frightening situation,"" she wrote. A 13-year-old girl made her first appearance in court on Friday in Wales on three counts of attempted murder after two teachers and a pupil were stabbed at a secondary school. The attack occurred at the Amman Valley School in Ammanford, north of Swansea, just after 11.00 am on April 24. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man jailed for seven-and-a-half years for violent 2005 robbery,Edwina Brincat,"A man who violently robbed an elderly woman at her St Julian’s home 19 years ago has been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison. Keith Cremona, now 36, was 17 years old when he robbed the woman in July 2005. He was convicted by a criminal court on Tuesday evening, following a two-day trial. Cremona’s 69-year-old victim has since passed away but her testimony earlier on in the proceedings before the Magistrates’ Court was read out at the first day of the trial. Benedetta Meilaq recounted how that morning around 9:30am she was quietly cooking in her kitchen when the doorbell rang. She went to the front door. That was the start of her ordeal. Three strangers, faces uncovered, stood outside. They barged in, pushing her aside and causing her to fall. The aggressors told her to hand over her money, but the woman said that she had none. She offered them her gold valuables instead but one of the robbers insisted on cash, saying that he had “two kids” and needed the money. While two of the intruders rummaged through her possessions, the third suspect, later identified as Cremona, allegedly dragged the woman along the corridor floor, right up to the kitchen where he grabbed a cordless phone and hit her on the head. He also twisted her right arm so roughly that she suffered a dislocated shoulder. The pain was “agonizing,” the victim later testified. She also told police the men were armed with a hunting shotgun. Meilaq told her aggressors about a purse with some money she used to keep at home. They found that purse with some Lm200 (€460) inside. The robbers took the money and fled the scene. Dazed and in pain, blood dripping from the cut on her head, the victim managed to make it to the front door but collapsed on the porch. A neighbour heard her cries for help. He went outside and found Meilaq lying on the floor, blood dripping from her head. Another woman who lived nearby was cleaning her balcony that morning when she heard Meilaq’s cries for help. The neighbour later told police that she had found the elderly victim with “a lot of blood” on her head and torn clothes. Other neighbours who were questioned by the police shortly after the incident said they heard nothing. None of those neighbours were summoned as witnesses at Cremona’s trial, and nor was the officer in charge of criminal investigations at the time. Those shortcomings were pointed out by Madam Justice Scerri Herrera when delivering  judgment on Tuesday evening. Cremona’s trial was assigned to the judge in 2019, but the accused subsequently filed constitutional proceedings. Health issues he suffered further delayed the trial. The judge noted that attorney general lawyers who were leading the prosecution during the trial were not to blame for “blatant shortcomings”, as they had stepped into the shoes of their predecessors when the bill of indictment had already been issued. Not summoning the victim’s neighbours and the investigating officer was a “serious shortcoming” in police work, supervised by the AG during the compilation of evidence. Photos of potential suspects that were shown to the victim years ago were not included in evidence. Nor did police ask the inquiring magistrate for an identification parade. At the time of the incident, the victim was unable to identify her aggressors, simply describing one of them as “thin.” No eyewitnesses were produced as witnesses to shed more light on the events of that July morning. Lacking such evidence, the Criminal Court had to examine the victim’s testimonies given shortly after her ordeal, then at the magisterial inquiry and seven years later during Cremona’s compilation of evidence. Although there were some divergences, she was consistent in all three versions. Meilaq also identified Cremona in court and said that she still suffered a painful shoulder, a reminder of her ordeal seven years before. Other forensic evidence, namely four fingerprints lifted from a wooden chest inside Meilaq’s home, were later found to match those of the accused. Criminal investigations kicked off immediately after the incident but it was years later that police received confidential information about Cremona’s alleged involvement in the crime. Cremona was subsequently charged in 2012 with aggravated theft, unlawfully holding his victim against her will as well as grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty, denying the allegations and insisting that he had never been to that St Julian’s residence. Based on the evidence put forward, the court was convinced that Cremona was one of the three aggressors who assaulted and robbed the victim. He was declared guilty and condemned to an effective jail term of seven and a half years, after the court also took note of his voluminous record. The prosecution had requested a maximum sentence of 30 years. He was also ordered to pay €1,255.29 in court expert expenses within six months. AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, David Gatt and Ishmael Psaila were defence counsel.

13-year-old boy killed in London sword attack,AFP,"A teenage boy died on Tuesday after a man wielding a sword stabbed the youth, two police and two other people, in a street attack in east London, police said. The man used what appeared to be a Samurai-type sword in the Hainault district shortly before 7 am. Police said they arrested a 36-year-old man using Taser stun weapons and took him into custody. The incident is not believed to be terror-related, they said. Chief Superintendent Stuart Bell, from London's Metropolitan Police, said all five victims were taken to hospital. The two police officers were awaiting surgery for ""significant"" injuries, he added. But they, and those sustained by the two members of the public, were not believed to be life-threatening. ""It's with great sadness that one of those injured in this incident, a 13-year-old boy, has died from their injuries,"" he told reporters at the scene. ""He was taken to hospital after being stabbed and sadly died a short while after."" Bell called the incident ""truly horrific"" and said specialist officers were supporting the boy's family. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the stabbings ""shocking"". ""Such violence has no place on our streets,"" he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. ""I'd like to thank the emergency services for their ongoing response, and pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery shown by police on the scene."" Video footage and photographs posted on social media appeared to show a man in a yellow jumper on the streets near houses with the weapon.  Emergency service vehicles, including police, fire and ambulances, were seen behind cordons, including near the town's underground railway station. One resident, who asked not to be named, said she hid behind a window while the suspect was outside her home shouting ""Do you believe in God?"" at police. ""We were very scared and trying to hide and not show ourselves through the window because he was standing right next to our house and he could have seen us if he looked up,"" she added. ""We were very scared and we didn't know what to do."" Another witness said he saw two police chasing the man, shouting at him to put down the weapon. Police in England, Scotland and Wales are not routinely armed but do carry Taser weapons to disable suspects. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by the incident and was in close contact with the city police commissioner. ""The police officers and emergency services showed the best of our city -- running towards danger to protect others and I thank them from the bottom of my heart,"" he said. Last week, Sunak criticised the mayor's record on knife crime in the British capital. According to official statistics, knife crime increased in London by 20 per cent in 2023, with 14,577 offences - one per cent lower than pre-pandemic levels in the year to March 2020. In England and Wales as a whole, there was a seven per cent increase in knife crime to 49,489 offences, with most (29 per cent) in metropolitan areas, the Official for National Statistics said.

"Woman, 69, was dragged, hit on the head, during robbery, court hears",Edwina Brincat,"An elderly woman quietly cooking in her kitchen ended up being dragged across her home and hit on the head by three men who barged in when she opened the door for her, a trial has heard. The hold-up took place 19 years ago and the woman, who was 69 at the time, has since died. But her testimony before a magistrate was read out in court during the trial of one of the three men on Monday. Keith Cremona, 36, who was seventeen years old when the alleged violent robbery took place in July 2005, stands accused of involvement in a violent armed robbery, holding the woman against her will and seriously injuring her. He has pleaded not guilty.   The trial, presided by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera, started on Monday and is expected to end later on Tuesday.  Recalling her ordeal, the woman, Bernardetta Meilaq, had testified how that July morning, around 9.30am, she was cooking in the kitchen of her home in Ta' Giorni Road, St Julian's, when the doorbell rang. Wrapping a towel around her chest, she headed to the front door. Three strangers were standing outside and immediately barged in, pushing her aside, causing her to fall. They demanded money but she told them she had none, pleading with them to take her gold valuables instead. But one of the robbers insisted that he wanted cash, saying that he had “two kids” and needed money. While two of the intruders rummaged through her possessions, the third, later identified as Cremona, dragged her along the corridor floor, right up to the kitchen where he grabbed a cordless phone and hit her on the head, the woman had testified. He also twisted her right arm so roughly that she suffered a dislocated shoulder. The pain was “agonizing,” she said. She also told police the men were armed with a hunting shotgun. The robbers fled the scene after they managed to find some Lm200 (460 euro) tucked inside a purse. Dazed and in pain, blood dripping from the cut on her head, the victim managed to make it to the front door but collapsed on the porch. The court was told that investigations kicked off but it was years later that police received confidential information which pointed at Cremona’s alleged involvement in the crime. Four of his fingerprints allegedly matched those found on a wooden chest inside the residence where the violent robbery had taken place. Cremona was subsequently charged in 2012 with aggravated theft, unlawfully holding his victim against her will as well as grievous bodily harm. After hearing a number of witnesses, the court heard submissions by both parties, with final arguments by the defence wrapped up on Tuesday. Judgment is expected later this evening. AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Ramon Bonett Sladden are prosecuting. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, David Gatt and Ishmael Psaila are defence counsel.

Police: Accused in attempted double murder said he loved ex’s kids like his own,Edwina Brincat,"A man who stands accused of attempting to murder his ex-partner’s daughters told investigators that he loved the girls “like his own children” and he remembered nothing of the assault. He was also unable to explain two Facebook photos he posted hours before the knife attack, one of them captioned with the word “vendetta.” Nazzareno Dalli, 43, is charged with attempted murder of the girls, aged 12 and 15 years old, in their home in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on March 9. The younger one was stabbed in the heart and lost up to 40 per cent of her blood, but is now recovering. The other was slightly injured. Dalli is pleading not guilty. Inspector Wayne Camilleri testified in the compilation of evidence about the two photos posted by the accused hours before the assault. The caption under one of them read: “Bonġu minn Zaren….lili ma jċekkinni ħadd…mhux se ċċekkinni int…Min jidħaq l-aħħar, jidħaq l-aħjar,” [Good morning from Zaren….No one will humiliate me….You won’t be the one to do so….He who laughs last, laughs best]. The picture showed Dalli, shirt unbuttoned, revealing a knife tucked at the waist. The vendetta-captioned picture showed Dalli standing against a darkish background at a nightclub, wearing a buttoned-up shirt that was possibly the same one worn at the time of the assault.  When confronted by those photos, Dalli told the police that he could not recall who had taken them. Nor could he explain the presence of that knife. A blood-smeared hunting knife, wrapped in a cloth, was found just behind the front door of the Marsa residence by scene of crime officers. Dalli had no recollection of that knife, even when it was unwrapped and shown to him during interrogation. The inspector also described the scene in the house after the assault saying the 12-year-old girl was in imminent danger of dying. Her 15-year-old sister was also injured. Doctors had told the police that the 12-year-old had suffered some 17 blows which damaged her vital organs and resulted in heavy bleeding. She was rushed, unconscious, to emergency surgery. Meanwhile her sister spoke to the inquiring magistrate and inspector, recounting how she was jolted out of her sleep at around 1pm by the screams of her younger sibling. She rushed to see what was happening and was met with a “scary scene.” She said her mother’s ex-partner, “Ronald tal-Muga,” (a family nickname) was stabbing her sister with a knife and there was a lot of blood all over the place. Although still drowsy, her immediate reaction was to try to stop the assault. But the aggressor turned upon her too, hitting her with the knife on her hand. Luckily she managed to get away, hiding in a room on the roof.   When the police arrived, there was blood splattered all over the place, mostly in the living room, with more traces on the stairs leading up to the roof and beyond, the inspector said.  He said the accused had walked into his ex’s home and out again in three minutes. Footage from various CCTV cameras along the street outside the residence where the alleged assault took place showed him walking up to the front door at 1:06pm-camera time not real time- testified the inspector. The suspect arrived from the direction of the Marsa bridge, drawing out a bunch of keys. Acting normally, he tried different keys and was successful on the third attempt, stepping inside and shutting the gate behind him.   Soon, his ex’s 14-year old son rushed outside. He later described the aggression, saying that it was Dalli who stabbed his sisters. Dalli himself left the residence three minutes later, running in the direction of the Marsa bridge. He later turned himself in at Cospicua police station, asking whether police were searching for him. He was read out his rights and arrested. The process was filmed on police bodycams. The suspect’s jeans and t-shirt - apparently the same ones worn during the crime - were handed to the DNA expert. The shirt he wore in the two photos posted on Facebook, was never retrieved, explained the investigator. The inspector said Dalli spoke at length under interrogation about his relationship with the girls’ mother, referring to her as “his ex.” They had been together for three years and he “loved her a lot.” According to him “he would do anything for her……He could not understand why she did what she did, leading to break up. He never gave a specific reason for their breakup,” the inspector said. The accused said he had moved in with the girls’ mother for some time and regarded her children “as his own.” He claimed to have helped her as best as he could, even paying for her car insurance policy. But when shown the photos he had posted on Facebook hours before the incident, he could not recall who had taken them, although he identified the background as the Red Stars bar at Zejtun. Nor could he explain the presence of the knife visible in one of the photos. That night he was working as an unlicensed security guard at the Osiris nightclub, heading to the Red Stars in Żejtun when he clocked off around 5am. That was where he allegedly paid for some drugs which he took with a drink. He had also previously consumed cocaine. “He didn’t know what it was. He didn’t even remember who he bought it from, simply saying that it was a man from Serbia,” the inspector said. “After that it was total blackout. He insisted he could not remember anything. He went to the police station when he heard that the police were looking for him. He recalled nothing about the attack, not even that he was in Marsa,” testified Camilleri. Dalli himself requested police gather CCTV footage from the nightclub and Żejtun bar. He also offered to give a urine sample to support his intoxication claims. Shown footage from the crime scene, Dalli identified himself and recognised the street where his ex lived. “But he didn’t know how he had the key to the place. He never had the key when he lived there. He just could not explain how the key ended up in his possession,” the inspector said.  The inspector also pointed out that Dalli had been charged under arrest after his ex partner filed a domestic violence report in which she was slightly injured.  He was cleared after the alleged victim chose not to testify against him. In January, the woman filed another report claiming that this time round she was suffering psychological abuse. Her claims were assessed by Appoġġ who classified the case as “standard” and “no risk.” The police nonetheless prosecuted Dalli under summons. The case, presided over by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, continues. AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech prosecuted together with Inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Ian Vella. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Franco Debono, Mario Mifsud, Nicholas Mifsud and Jacob Magri are defence counsel. Lawyer Roberta Spiteri appeared parte civile.

Man accused of raping his ex when she called for her ring,Edwina Brincat,"A man who allegedly raped his ex-partner when she went to his apartment to collect her engagement ring after their break-up, was denied bail on Monday.  The woman turned up at St Julian’s police station on Saturday, claiming that her former fiancé had raped her.  The two had been engaged for a couple of years and ever since breaking up they remained in an “on-and-off relationship” for the past six months or so, occasionally also having consensual sex.  But that was not the case last Friday, the prosecution explained when charging the man in court.  The alleged victim went to the St Julian’s apartment at around 6am to collect her engagement ring, having forwarded the agreed amount of some €400 beforehand.  When she told him she wanted to leave, he allegedly grabbed her and raped her. The man, a 27-year-old Norwegian i-gaming employee, pleaded not guilty to non-consensual sex, holding his ex against her will, slightly injuring her, attempting to use force against her, insulting and threatening her as well as causing her to fear violence.  The prosecution objected to bail because of the early stage of the proceedings, the serious nature of the charges, the fact that the main witness is still to testify and also the risk of tampering.  His lawyer, Franco Debono, countered that not only was the accused gainfully occupied and living in Malta but the case presented conflicting versions. The accused claimed that the woman did what she did after he refused to see her any longer because she was “seeing other men”. Moreover, she had testified before the inquiring magistrate and could not testify again unless authorised by the court.  Throughout the hearing the man was seen in tears, turning round to make eye contact with a woman seated behind him, occasionally taking her hand until the magistrate ordered him to sit properly.  Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo turned down the bail request and issued a ban on the names of both parties, because of the sensitivity of the case.

Arrest connected to 700g heroin bust declared invalid by court,Jessica Arena,"A 39-year-old man who was arrested in connection with a 700g heroin bust has had his detention by the police declared null after a court determined that police had not met the sufficient requirements to arrest him.  Stefano Montebello was one of three men arraigned on Sunday over a drug bust the police made after stopping a car in Buġibba that turned out to be full of sachets that looked like they had been packaged ready to be sold.  The car was being driven by 50-year-old Pierre Cremona. Montebello was in the car with him at the time.  The vehicle was searched and yielded what was suspected to be cocaine and heroin.  With Cremona and Montebello in tow, police went on to search a residence in Mosta, where they also found the older man’s 24-year-old son, Owen Cremona.  At the Mosta home police discovered a bag thought to contain some 700g of heroin, a Les Baer pistol, bullets and other drug-related paraphernalia.  All three men were charged with heroin possession not intended for their personal use, unlicensed possession of a firearm and recidivism.  Pierre Cremona and Montebello were also charged with cocaine possession, while Pierre was separately charged with breaching previous bail conditions.  All three pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit objected to Montebello’s arrest, because, they argued, his arrest at the time did not adequately satisfy all the requirements as stipulated by the law.  While police had obtained a warrant for the arrest of the father and son, one had not been obtained for Montebello, they said. Additionally, Montebello claimed that police had not informed him of the reason why he was being arrested, something that is also evident from the police body cam footage that was exhibited in the disclosure.  The criminal code, they added, stipulates that a person must be explicitly informed that they are being arrested and why they have been placed under arrest in order for the detainment to be considered valid.  After hearing arguments from both sides, Magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled in favour of the defence and declared that by virtue of not disclosing the reasons for the arrest, then Montebello’s arrest must be declared illegitimate. She ordered his immediate release.  Requesting bail for Owen Cremona, the defence said that while the heroin had been found at the Mosta residence, the police had yet to sufficiently prove whom it belonged to.  Save for a couple of traffic fines, the young man had an otherwise clean criminal record, they said, adding he was willing to live at a separate address with his mother.  The prosecution objected to bail due to the nature of the crime and because Owen Cremona was also charged with recidivism.  The court granted Owen bail against a deposit of € 2,000 and a personal guarantee of € 10,000. He was also ordered to observe a curfew and not approach civilian witnesses.  A bail request for Pierre Cremona was summarily rejected by the court, which cited his criminal record as the primary reason why.  Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.

Watch: ‘Today you will die’ – receptionist recounts Sliema hold-up ordeal,Claudia Calleja,"A young hotel receptionist has spoken about how he was scared for his life when a robber pressed a gun to his head during a hold-up at a Sliema hotel on Monday night. Despite his terror, Nissan Singh Thapa, 29, managed to remain calm enough to think clearly – before fleeing from his captor and entering a guest room where he could call for help. “Today you will die… If you make any sudden movement you will die on the spot,” – were the words the armed robber kept telling Nissan as he pressed the silver gun against his head and into his back and stomach. In a blow-by-blow account, two days after the hold-up, Nissan spoke about how he kept replaying the scene in his mind once the ordeal was over. Two men wearing black helmets charged into The Windsor Hotel in the heart of Sliema at night.   “When the gun was pointed to my head, my back… I was scared for my life. Really scared. In 29 years, this is the first time anything like this happened to me or anyone in my family. After seeing the gun, my mind went blank for a second. I didn’t know what to do. But I knew I had to stay calm in this situation because one wrong decision would cost me my life. I knew I had to do whatever they were telling me to do and look for any opportunity to escape,” he said. Nissan came to Malta in September 2022 to study hospitality at MCAST, graduating with a diploma just last February. On Monday, he had the night shift at the hotel where he works part time. At around 11.30pm he was inside the small office leading to the reception area when he heard a knock at the reception desk. He saw two men wearing helmets, with balaclavas covering their faces.   The men, who the receptionist initially mistook as food deliverymen, asked for a room. But seconds later all of that changed.: “One of them got out a gun and put it on the reception desk and said: ‘Give me all your f** money’ and jumped over the counter,” he said. The robber started searching the area, frantically opening drawers and cupboards and demanding to know where the money was kept.   Nissan explained to him there was no money because most people paid by card. He handed over €200 which one guest paid in cash as well as his mobile phone and wallet. The robber then pushed Nissan into the office and told his accomplice to jump over into the reception area to continue searching. Once inside the office the thief smashed the security camera.   “He then told me to kneel in the corner and put my hands on my head. He looked around the office. Every couple of seconds he would come to me and put the gun against my head, my back or stomach and say: ‘Where’s the money, where’s the money?’ He told me: ‘You’re gonna die. I’ll kill you if you don’t give me the money’.” Nissan’s cry that there was no money was in vain. The robber asked for a safe and the manager’s main office. “It was on the sixth floor. He asked for the key to the offices, but I explained I don’t have them. He insisted. ""He started looking through drawers and found a lanyard with a master keycard and a key. He decided that was the key he needed.” They walked up six flights of stairs. Through the whole time the gun was planted on Nissan’s back with the robbers threatening to kill him if he stepped out of line.   When they arrived on the sixth floor the key did not fit the glass door that led to the office area. There was a guest room next door, and the robber opened it with the master keycard. Thankfully, there was no one inside. He then broke the glass and jumped into the office area and ordered Nissan not to move. When the receptionist heard him rummaging through an office down the corridor, he knew it was now or never. “I knew he would not find anything here and would take the frustration out on me. I knew I had five seconds. I always keep a master card in my pocket in case a guest needed something. I knew I could not run downstairs as there was the other guy and I would get sandwiched between them. ""As soon as I saw the opportunity, I just ran. I knew there were three rooms on the floor and which were not occupied. I ran and went in one room and waited. I heard him run down the stairs. I stayed in the room for about 10 minutes,” he said. Nissan then emerged slowly and quietly from the room and headed to another room on the fifth floor where he knew a guest was staying. “I knocked at the door. I told him what was happening and that I needed his phone to call the police. I told police they had a gun. We stayed in the room until we heard the police arrive,” he said. When the police arrived he called his boss who turned up immediately. The two unidentified robbers had fled the scene. Nissan was taken to Mater Dei Hospital to get certified, according to procedure, but his ordeal was protracted further – he waited in the emergency department alone for about seven hours. “I was about to faint. My body was breaking down slowly. I started replaying things in my head. I was making decisions every second. So many things could have gone wrong. By God’s grace, not even a bruise,” said Nissan.

Man wanted since 2018 arrested at police station after reporting lost wallet,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who failed to attend court sittings since December 2018 over his alleged involvement in a hold-up, was arrested at a police station where he had gone to file a report over a lost wallet, the court heard on Friday. Police inspector Joseph Mercieca told Magistrate Victor Axiak that Christopher El Shoushani, 48, from Sliema, was on the police wanted list after disappearing just three months after he was granted bail in September 2018 during proceedings over his alleged involvement in a hold-up. Mercieca said the police were informed that the accused was residing in the UK and were in the process of issuing a European Arrest Warrant and an extradition order for him to be extradited to Malta. However, it emerged that El Shoushani managed to pass through the airport upon his arrival in Malta and was finally apprehended by police when he went to the Sliema police station to report a lost wallet. The police alert system flagged the man who was immediately arrested. El Shoushani was charged with breaching his bail conditions and with relapsing. He pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Axiak refused a request for bail because the man did not have a fixed address, with the court demanding a copy of his rent contract as evidence of residency. Lawyers Jose Herrera and Martina Herrera were defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Father and two teen sons denied bail after drug bust,Matthew Xuereb,"A father and his two teenage sons were escorted to jail on Friday after being denied bail over their alleged involvement in a drug bust of over 100 sachets containing different drugs. The 39-year-old father and his two sons, aged 19 and 17, were stopped by the police in Cospicua who were acting on a report by community police officers about potential drug trafficking taking place in the village square. Police Inspectors Alfredo Mangion and Mark Cremona explained that after the Drugs Squad and the Community Police had received these reports, an arrest warrant was obtained and the 39-year-old was stopped yesterday while driving his Toyota Vitz, in the company of his two teenage sons. During a search, the police found some 80 sachets containing a substance suspected to be cocaine, together with 16 sachets of suspected heroin and five bags of suspected cannabis. All three were arrested and arraigned in court on Friday where they pleaded not guilty to aggravated drug possession. The court imposed a ban on the publication of their names since the youngest defendant is only 17 years old and therefore still a minor. They denied possession of the substances in circumstances indicating they were not solely for their personal consumption. Inspector Mangion objected to a request for bail, arguing that almost 100 sachets of drugs had been seized by the police. He said these were ready packaged and clearly intended for sale to other drug victims, with all the harm that this caused to them and their families. He said there was a strong risk of further crimes being committed should the defendants be released from arrest. Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting the defendants together with lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Mark Mifsud Cutajar, argued that despite the number of sachets found by the police, the three were not charged with drug trafficking but with aggravated possession. The total weight of the drugs was around 20 grams, Debono said, adding that the intention behind the Drug (Treatment not Imprisonment) Act was to recommend treatment instead of imprisonment. Mifsud Cutajar pointed out that the arrest warrant had only been obtained for the father’s arrest and that his sons just “happened to be in the car with him.” Defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi submitted that the prosecution’s arguments were trying to instil “a fear of the bogeyman,” by referring to possible future crimes. Any potential risk must be substantiated with relevant evidence, he insisted. The court, however, denied bail at this stage, ruling that it felt the defendants did not provide the court with peace of mind that they could respect the bail conditions, one of which was that of not committing other crimes while on bail. They were therefore remanded in custody. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Baggies thrown out of car during police chase turn out to be heroin, court hears",Matthew Xuereb,"Items chucked out of the window of a moving car during a police chase later turned out to be 30 sachets of heroin, a court heard on Friday. Patrick Borg, 49, from Birkirkara, was apprehended by the police who were following him and another two people after a tip-off that they were involved in drug trafficking. During the chase, he was seen throwing items outside his car. When he was stopped, the other two fled. The three bags he was seen throwing out of the car each contained ten sachets of small doses of heroin, police inspector Clayton Camilleri told Magistrate Victor Axiak. Borg pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him, which included trafficking within 100 metres of a place frequented by youths and relapsing. Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit argued that the total amount of heroin involved was “not an exaggerated amount” and asked for bail which was upheld by the court, against a €500 deposit and a €10,000 personal guarantee. He was ordered to sign the bail book twice a week and not to speak to any of the prosecution’s witnesses.     You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Alleged medal thief jailed for stealing cash in another incident,Matthew Xuereb,"The man who is facing charges over the theft of gold medals from the Maritime Museum last month was back in court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to stealing almost €1,000 from a Valletta establishment. Justin Mallia, 26, from Cospicua, admitted to the theft of €960 from a room where money was stored at the back of the Valletta Food Market. The theft occurred on March 14, a few days before the gold medals were stolen. Before Magistrate Victor Axiak, Mallia pleaded guilty and offered to pay back the amount he had stolen. He also pleaded guilty to being a relapse. The magistrate gave him time to reconsider his plea and once confirmed, jailed him for a year. He also ordered him to pay back the amount stolen within six months of his release from jail. The court heard how Mallia was arrested in jail after CCTV footage confirmed that he had stolen the cash from two cashboxes in a back room of the Valletta establishment. Inspector Gabriel Micallef told the court that Mallia immediately admitted to the theft upon his arrest. Lawyer Tilden Tabone, from the office of the Attorney General also prosecuted while lawyer Martina Herrera appeared for the man as legal aid.    Mallia is currently being held in preventive custody over the theft of gold medals from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa. He allegedly posed as an official from the education department, visiting the museum to deliver documents, when he allegedly stole the gold medals to settle debts. He was arrested before he had time to sell the items worth €400,000 but the medals were placed inside a pouch and were subsequently damaged. The case is still pending.

Tabloid head wanted to 'protect' Trump from salacious stories,AFP,"A key witness in the criminal trial of Donald Trump detailed Thursday how he worked with the former president's personal lawyer to kill a Playboy model's story about a sexual relationship with the Republican. It's the third day of testimony in the criminal trial of Trump, whom prosecutors accuse of falsifying business records to pay off adult film actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign. He is the first former US head of state to face criminal charges. The high-stakes trial demands Trump report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden. Prosecutors say Trump engaged in ""election fraud"" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a $130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election. The latest testimony from David Pecker - the 72-year-old former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid - points to a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, that was a precursor to the Daniels saga. ""I wanted to protect my company, I wanted to protect myself and I wanted also to protect Donald Trump,"" Pecker nonchalantly told jurors, providing a clear statement that his efforts with the candidate and his lawyer were geared at influencing the presidential election -- which eventually saw the brash real estate mogul take the White House over Hillary Clinton.   The affable Pecker candidly explained how transfers to the tune of $150,000 were made to ""catch and kill"" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a ""large purchase"" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content. He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws. ""We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization,"" Pecker told jurors. ""We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."" He said Cohen had encouraged him to purchase the story, and when he asked how he would get reimbursed, Cohen said ""the boss will take care of it"". Pecker said that not only did McDougal receive payment, but that the deal also guaranteed her magazine covers and the possibility to publish fitness columns. But McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from the Wall Street Journal, which prosecutors showed jurors. Pecker said Trump called him and was ""very upset."" ""How could this happen, I thought you had this under control,"" Pecker recalled Trump telling him, before hanging up with no goodbye. And when it came to squashing Daniels's tale of her sexual affair with Trump - that hush money payment is core to the case - Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story. ""I'm not a bank,"" Pecker said, also saying he didn't want his publication, which is sold in supermarkets, to be associated with a porn star. The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did from his own home equity line of credit, wiring it through a shell company. Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds and he is forced to sit silently under the glaring fluorescent lights of the courtroom, listening to both prosecutors and Pecker deliver accounts of his alleged misdeeds. He has also borne witness to Judge Juan Merchan admonishing the former president's lead lawyer Todd Blanche, who this week blustered through his defense of the Republican as prosecutors asked to hold Trump in contempt of court. They say Trump has repeatedly violated a partial gag order barring him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors and court staff.  Merchan heard arguments over the accusation Tuesday but did not issue an immediate ruling, which he could drop at any moment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial. Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, ""sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly.""

Tunisian sex ed flyers mentioning homosexuality removed from book fair,AFP,"Booklets intended for Tunisian parents to answer their children's questions about sexuality, including same-sex relations, have been pulled out from the Tunis International Book Fair, its director said Thursday. The fair's director, Mohamed Salah Kadri, told AFP that the sex education pamphlets had been withdrawn by representatives of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which produced the material in collaboration with the Tunisian Reproductive Health Association. ""We expressed our embarrassment about the content of these pamphlets, and the UNFPA representatives were understanding and removed them from their stand,"" Kadri said. The UNFPA as well as the Tunisian association did not respond to AFP's requests for comment The pamphlets offer answers to questions frequently asked by teenagers and children around sexuality, according to media reports, including same-sex relations. Article 230 of Tunisia's penal code criminalises consensual same-sex sexual relations and sets a punishment of up to three years in prison. It also allows the authorities to conduct anal tests on individuals, a practice harshly criticised by the United Nations' Committee Against Torture. The legislation, which dates back to the French colonial era, has remained in force since Tunisia gained independence in 1956 despite calls from civil society groups to revoke it. Since Tunisia's 2011 revolution, LGBTQ activists have been able to work more publicly, but their situation remains precarious due to both legal and social norms.

Youth who sent 'indecent' messages to ex charged over drug possession,Times of Malta,"An 18-year-old who allegedly sent ""indecent"" messages to his ex was charged in court on Thursday over aggravated drug possession. Inspectors Francesco Mizzi and Nico Zarb arraigned 18-year-old Kyrese Lares, a British national from Swieqi before magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, charging him with sexual harassment and possession of ecstasy and cannabis. Court was told on Thursday that the defendant’s ex-girlfriend reported Lares to the police for sexual harassment after he allegedly sent her ""indecent"" messages as well as footage purporting to show him having sex with another woman. When officers executing a search warrant at his house seized the man’s phone, they also found an undisclosed amount of cash and cannabis, as well as weighing scales. Ecstasy was also retrieved during the search, the court was told. Lares pleaded not guilty to the charges with his lawyer, Noel Bianco, requesting bail. Objections were raised by the prosecution, primarily on the grounds that his drug abuse increased the risk of him committing further offences if released from arrest. Bianco however rebutted that the man had been in possession of just one ecstasy pill that he had split in two. He said he had bought the pill and then forgotten all about it because he had smoked too much cannabis.  Bianco said the defendant’s father was in the courtroom and was willing to help him out. While acknowledging the father’s presence in court, the court said it was still “very premature” for Lares to be released. He had a drug problem that he had not yet decided whether he wanted to address, the magistrate said. Bail was denied and at the defence’s request, the court directed the prison director to house the defendant at the Young Offenders unit.

European police smash rare book theft ring,AFP,"European police said Thursday they had busted a criminal gang suspected of snatching at least 170 rare books written by Russian literary greats such as Alexander Pushkin or Nikolai Gogol. The suspected thieves posed as researchers at libraries, distracting staff while an accomplice replaced the valuable first editions with a copy of “outstanding quality”, Europol said. “In other cases, members simply broke into libraries and took books they had already seen earlier,” said prosecutors in Lithuania. The books “of high historical and cultural value” were stolen in seven different European countries and worth around 2.5 million euros ($2.4 million), authorities said.  RELATED STORIES  Police arrested four Georgian citizens and raided 27 locations in Georgia and Latvia. One book was recovered and many others seized that are now being examined. Leading up to the raids, three suspects had been arrested in Estonia, France and Lithuania, with another two suspects under judicial supervision in France, said Europol. Prosecutors in Georgia said the suspects had been charged with offences that could result in a sentence of between six and 10 years in prison. Poland and Baltic states said last year that 19th-century Russian literature tomes were disappearing, with originals replaced by fakes and some resurfacing later in Russia.

Prime Minister open to changing laws to protect bus drivers,Matthew Xuereb,"Robert Abela said he was open to considering legislative changes to protect bus drivers, as he urged respect for those providing the invaluable service. The Prime Minister was fielding questions from Times of Malta on whether he felt laws needed to be changed to ensure better protection of bus drivers, following at least three cases of abuse by commuters in recent weeks. The law already provides higher punishments for assaults on public officers such as the police and soldiers. The government is currently considering extending this to journalists.  Last week, a bus driver was assaulted and insulted in full view of other passengers on a Valletta-bound bus. Footage shared on social media showed a male passenger yelling at the driver to open the bus door, while the bus was moving to pick up a €50 note he allegedly saw on the ground. The man could be heard swearing and insulting the driver in Maltese. He also makes derogatory comments about the driver being ""Indian"". When the driver said he would be calling the police, the passenger turned aggressive and banged on the perspex intended to protect bus drivers.  ""If you call the police, I [will] kill you,"" he can be heard saying at one point. The footage shows the man reaching out to hit the driver on multiple occasions. Earlier in the week, about 80 passengers on a packed bus had to disembark in Msida after a man wearing safety boots kicked and shattered the glass door because the bus was too full to allow him aboard. The previous day, a bus driver was slammed on social media for ""blocking an ambulance"" when in reality he had no choice because there was a concrete truck blocking the road in front of him.   “If there’s a need to revise the laws we can do it. In truth, that’s a continuous process. ""But I appeal for more respect. Bus drivers are providing a very important service to the country and they require everyone’s respect. I condemn any form of abuse on anyone, including bus drivers. The nation needs to show more respect,” Abela said. He said assaults were already covered by heavy punishments and he was satisfied with the punishments meted out by the courts.

Pembroke deputy mayor accused of threatening his mother,Claudia Calleja,"The deputy mayor of Pembroke has been charged with threatening his mother and causing her to fear him. Omar Elaref Arab, 32, pleaded not guilty to domestic violence against his mother in her Pembroke home where he lived with her. Police Inspector Omar Zammi said that on April 24 at about 6.30pm the mother of the accused filed a domestic violence report. She said her son had a drug addiction problem that had escalated, and she was scared of him. He was arrested at his girlfriend’s house in Valletta. Lawyer Etienne Calleja, for the accused, did not contest the arrest. He however questioned the way the arrest was carried out. Calleja said police “made a show” of the arrest with 20 police officers turning up at the house “to arrest a man in his pyjamas watching a movie.” The lawyer also asked Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit to issue a ban on the name of the accused saying he was a public figure as he was the deputy mayor of Pembroke. The inspector retorted that being a public figure was not a reason listed by law to ban the identity of a person from publication. The magistrate agreed saying that, if anything, a public person was more in the public domain than a private citizen unless the matter was intimately personal or involved minors. The magistrate ordered that the man be remanded in custody and recommended that the prison authorities help him address his drug addiction while in preventative custody.

"Benefits racket fraudsters to get presidential pardon, with conditions",Mark Laurence Zammit,"Hundreds of people who fraudulently received disability benefits they were not entitled to will be granted a presidential pardon against conditions, the government has announced. The crime will be struck off their police conduct on conditions that include they pay back all their ill-gotten gains – in full or through a repayment plan – and that they agree to testify in court against any individual they know was involved in running the racket. The pardon does not apply to those who allegedly masterminded the benefit fraud. It was discussed and approved by cabinet last week and has been signed by President Myriam Spiteri Debono. This means that hundreds of people who have been receiving around €450 monthly benefits for years after claiming they had a severe disability they did not actually suffer from will now be eligible to be granted the presidential pardon. One source close to government said, however, the pardon is not intended to let people off the hook. But the cabinet acknowledged that, as has been revealed in court, many of those who received benefits they were not entitled to were genuinely sick, poor and needed the money. For some of them, the benefit money was their livelihood, the source said, and others have illnesses that are so severe, that they would have probably been eligible for the benefit had they presented a genuine application with genuine medical certificates. Moreover, another source added, some of them claim they truly had no idea they were applying for money they were not entitled to. “What makes it even worse is that these people – some of whom were already in financial dire straits before being ordered to return all the money – now also risk being fired from their job if the court finds them guilty of the crime,” he said. “The pardon is also only intended for the small fish,” he added. Any person who was involved in masterminding, orchestrating or running any part of the racket will not be eligible for the presidential pardon. This means that popular doctor and former Labour MP Silvio Grixti and four other people who have already been charged over alleged involvement in the large-scale, years-long racket will not be pardoned. Neither will any other person who, in the future, may be charged with running the scam or any part of it. This is the latest development in the saga that has been dramatically unfolding over the past months, revealing the remarkable magnitude of the intricate racket that has so far detected 288 people had received thousands of euros in fraudulent benefits who were ordered to refund a combined more than €5 million. Many have been questioned by the police’s Financial Crimes Investigation Unit (FCID) and charged in court and most are admitting to the charges and agreeing to return their ill-gotten gains, thus getting off with a suspended sentence for defrauding the government. Evidence indicates that in many cases, Grixti provided false medical documents to help people receive the benefits. When questioned by police, some of his patients said they were truly suffering from other medical conditions and thought they were entitled to the benefit, claiming they had no idea they had been receiving illicit funds. Others had no illnesses or disabilities and admitted they were aware they were breaking the law, but said they were persuaded to apply when Labour canvassers assured them that they would never be caught and that the money was EU funds earmarked for PL supporters. Many others said they paid thousands of euros in kickbacks to their fixers. People who received benefits fraudulently will have to apply for the presidential pardon through a process during which they will also need to agree to its conditions. Those who have already been charged and sentenced in court will have the crime struck off their police conduct and those who are yet to be caught but come forward to apply for the pardon and return their ill-gotten gains will not be charged. In 2014, the government had similarly granted amnesty to some 1,000 people who had bribed public officers to acquire tampered electricity meters. Back then, the people could apply for the amnesty and not be taken to court, on condition they pay for their stolen electricity plus a fine. Earlier this month, Grixti and four other people were charged in court with playing a key role in the disability benefits racket that is believed to have cost taxpayers as much as €6 million. Handwritten ledgers found by police at the home of one of the suspected agents in the racket also indicated that beneficiaries paid sums which were split between Grixti and the go-betweens. Police combing through a laptop belonging to Grixti also told court they found document templates bearing other doctors’ names indicative of document forgery. A former cybercrime unit officer said he found more than 400 files that were deemed relevant to the investigation on the laptop. And a top social services department official told the court that the earliest recorded case in the racket dated back to 2016. The department had so far blocked payments to 321 recipients, he said. Some of those might not yet have been charged. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Three arrested for suspected drug-trafficking,Times of Malta,"Three men are under arrest after being found in possession of drugs on Wednesday. The police said they were tipped off about the suspicious movements of three people in Swatar near Birkirkara. On going to the spot, officers found two men waiting outside a car and a third in the driving seat. They acted suspiciously when the police arrived, with one of them walking to another car and attempting to drive off. He was blocked by a police car and arrested. Officers also arrested the other two. The arrested men were two aged 41 and 49 from Birkirkara and a 48-year-old from Msida. The police said one of the men became agitated and started resisting officers when he was about to be searched. Sachets of suspected heroin were found in his possession. The police also recovered other sachets thrown away during the arrests. A total of 30 sachets in all were found. A magisterial inquiry is underway.

"Architect, 52, charged over theft of vases, clock from Grand Master's Palace",Edwina Brincat,"Updated 5.15pm with Minister's comments in parliament An architect involved in the restoration of the Grand Master's Palace has been accused of stealing three antique vases and a clock from the historic Valletta building.  Ljubica Zivkovic, 52, from Belgrade, Serbia, denied charges of aggravated theft, unlawful possession of the cultural artefacts acquired illegally and breaching probation for similar offences when she appeared in court on Wednesday.   The architect, who lives in Iklin, was a project manager who worked for a restoration company involved in works at the palace, according to sources. She joined in the last six months of the project, handling last minute civil works.  Her role meant she had access across the palace, which was reopened to visitors in January after years of extensive restoration.  The court was told that the items she is alleged to have stolen have not been recovered. Their theft was reported on April 5.  The court heard that the accused, who was described as an architect in court filings, has a substance abuse problem and was on probation for similar offences. Lawyer Rachel Tua said she could not be identified from footage held by the police.    Bail was refused after objections from the prosecution, which pointed to the accused's criminal record and the fact that civilians including her co-workers are still to testify. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech deemed the accused untrustworthy.  Attorney General lawyer Nicholas Degaetano and Inspectors Christina Delia and Daryl Borg prosecuted together with Kurt Farrugia for superintendent of cultural heritage. Lawyer Rachel Tua was defence counsel.  A spokesperson from the Kamra tal-Periti said that Zivkovic did not have a warrant to practice as an architect or civil engineer and was not authorised to call herself an architect by law.  Times of Malta reported on Tuesday that the police had identified the suspect after examining footage from several security cameras. The three vases and the clock were valued at €13,000 in total.  Heritage Malta issued a statement just over two weeks ago to reveal the disappearance of the artefacts. The items went missing from halls within the palace, which was reopened to the public earlier this year following five years of extensive restoration. The disappearance of the vases and the clock came less than a month after two gold medals valued at €400,000 were stolen from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa. The medals were traced inside the residence of a man who was charged over their theft and granted bail. The court heard how the medals had sustained “irreversible damage” until they were recovered.  The Malta Maritime Museum has since beefed up security and launched an internal probe into the theft.  On Wednesday evening, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici assured parliament that security systems at heritage sites were working well.  ""The security systems we have at Heritage Malta sites that include CCTV at important points have worked well for the second time"".  He said the alleged thief of the vases from the palace had been caught within ""a few days"", while a man accused of stealing two gold medals from the Vittoriosa maritime museum was caught within hours. During parliament's sitting on Wednesday culture minister said security systems at Heritage sites are working well.  ""The security systems we have at Heritage Malta that include CCTV at important points have show to work well for the second time"".  He said the suspect accused of the palace theft was caught in a few days after the event, while a man accused of stealing two gold medals in the Vittoriosa maritime museum was caught within hours.

'We won't have trouble as long as Michael Falzon remains minister',Mark Laurence Zammit,"One of the men accused of involvement in the social benefits racket said a social policy ministry official had told him that as long as Michael Falzon remains minister, they wouldn't have ""trouble"". Roger Agius, one of five who stand accused in court of alleged involvement in the large-scale racket also claimed the official handed him a burner phone they used to run the racket. ""An official at the Social Security Ministry had given me a burner phone in 2019 through which we communicated about fraudulent applications,"" Roger Agius wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. ""The public official had told me: 'As long as the minister [Michael Falzon] remains there, we will never have trouble'.""   Agius said he decided to resort to Facebook after having formally written to the police and the AG to take him before a magistrate to disclose all the details under oath in a magisterial inquiry. But he has still not heard back from them. Agius was the driver and close confidant of doctor and former Labour MP Silvio Grixti, who is alleged to have played a central role in the racket by providing applicants with false medical certificates which secured them the severe disability allowance after they appeared before a medical board. Agius and three other co-accused allegedly acted as agents or go-betweens, raking in payments from the successful beneficiaries. He was also later employed as parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul's driver, despite having been receiving the benefits for claiming to have epilepsy and for claiming that he had no driving licence. In the Facebook post on Tuesday, Agius said he was still exchanging documents with the official as part of the racket till as recently as March last year. He added that the same official would also make sure the medical board was composed in such a way that would guarantee the person fraudulently posing as a patient would be approved for the benefits. Agius described the official as ""a person of trust of Michael Falzon"" but did not name him. It is believed the person could be Mark Calleja. Lawyer Jason Azzopardi told a court last week that Calleja would order reconsideration of failed applications for severe disability benefits even though normal procedure did not allow a right of appeal. Azzopardi said Calleja would get a screenshot photo of people who failed the medical board the day before and would order a reconsideration. On Tuesday, Agius also published correspondence dating back to November last year, when he informed the police and the office of the AG that he knew where the racket originated and was willing to disclose details of ""a conspiracy in which cabinet members and political officials have been complicit since 2019"". ""But I never received a reply,"" he wrote, adding that in November he had also asked the investigating inspector to take him ""in a [specific] public building in Valletta to show him traces of the crime in this racket and to show him how the public official operated"". ""The inspector had told me these were theatrics,"" Agius wrote. The published documents also detail how Agius was willing to testify that on one occasion, the ministry official had said, ""If they [the claimants] spend more than three minutes before the board you can spit at me"", indicating his certainty the operation would run smoothly. Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon refused to comment when asked on the matter. ""I don't have comments,"" he told Times of Malta as he walked into parliament on Tuesday afternoon. ""Write whatever you want, as you usually do,"" he added.   He was asked whether Mark Calleja was still working in his ministry and whether he still had faith in him as a person of trust. Times of Malta wanted to ask Falzon whether he stood by comments he made in September when he had insisted the scandal had originated from outside the ministry. But Falzon walked into the parliament building before the question could be asked. The magnitude of the racket continued to unfold last week, when police told court they found handwritten ledgers at the home of one of the suspected agents in the racket which indicated that beneficiaries paid sums which were split between Grixti and the middlemen.

Msida apartment block sees five break-ins since January,Emma Borg,"An apartment block in Msida has seen five break-ins since January, according to one resident, who said she has moved out because she feels unsafe. Christine Amaira said that one of her neighbours got the fright of her life when she saw a burglar holding a knife as she was about to open her balcony door.   Another tenant found a 30cm knife and gloves in their flat, possibly left by robbers who left in a rush.  In a Facebook post, the former journalist said she moved into her sixth floor apartment in September, hoping it would be her haven. But a few months down the line, it had become “a total nightmare.” At least three attempts were made to break into her own flat and at least one may have been successful, she said.   She became suspicious that someone might be illegally entering her flat when some money went missing in January. Her suspicions were confirmed only a few weeks later when her neighbour told her they believed someone had also stolen their money.  A month later, Amaira said she was sleeping at home when a flash of light hit her eyes, but she convinced herself it was a dream. The next day, her neighbour said their home was broken into. She believed the robbers were entering and leaving through the balconies. The residents did not want the name of the street revealed. A police report was filed in February and Amaira installed a security system. Last Wednesday was the final straw for Amaira, when the security system detected a person in the vicinity of her flat. Her home was not broken into, but her neighbour wasn’t as lucky. Police were called and arrived on the scene. But she didn't feel safe enough to remain at the property and moved in with her parents. “They drove me out of my own home... I am pretty sure there are more break-ins we just don't know about them,"" said Amaira.  Times of Malta has contacted the police for comment.

Quick-thinking receptionist raises alarm during armed robbery in Sliema hotel,Claudia Calleja,"Two armed men made off with cash after holding a receptionist at gunpoint at the Windsor Hotel in Sliema on Monday night. But their haul would have been bigger had the receptionist not managed to dart into a room as he was ordered upstairs where more money was kept, the police said.  The incident happened at 11.45pm when two men wearing crash helmets entered the hotel lobby and demanded cash. At least one of them carried a gun. After handing them cash he had in the till, the receptionist was ordered to take the robbers to another floor, where more money was kept. But on the way up the receptionist managed to dart into a room, lock the door and call for help. No one was injured but the 29-year-old receptionist, an Indian national, suffered shock.

"Police identify suspected thief of palace vases, clock",Matthew Xuereb,"Police have identified the person who they suspect stole three vases and a clock from Valletta’s Grand Master’s Palace earlier this month. Multiple sources close to the investigation said police are closing in on the mysterious theft after tracing the suspect in footage from several security cameras in the area. The three vases and the clock – valued at €13,000 in total – have not been recovered yet. It is not yet known why the suspect has not yet been arrested, with sources only saying that the case is “ongoing”. Heritage Malta issued a statement just over two weeks ago to reveal the disappearance of the artefacts. The items went missing from halls within the palace, which was reopened to the public earlier this year following five years of intense restoration that has more than doubled its accessibility to visitors. The disappearance of the vases and the clock came less than a month since two gold medals valued at €400,000 were stolen from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa. The medals were traced inside the residence of a man who was charged over their theft and granted bail. The court heard how the medals had sustained “irreversible damage” until they were recovered. Justin Mallia, 25, from Cospicua had allegedly posed as an official from the education department, visiting the museum to deliver documents when he stole the gold medals to settle debts. The Malta Maritime Museum has since beefed up security and launched an internal probe into the theft. One case involving another artefact of national heritage, however, remains unsolved, as police are yet to conclude investigations or charge anyone over a British-era stone-marker spotted inside Minister Anton Refalo’s Gozo home in 2022. The public first got to know that Refalo had the stone marker in the garden of his Qala house when a photo posted on social media by one of his family members showed the stone in the background. The marker bears the inscription VR (Victoria Regina). Stones like it used to dot Malta and Gozo to mark confines of territories and are now protected by law. The Superintendence for Cultural Heritage had confirmed it found the artefact in Refalo’s house. The stage of the investigation remains unclear and Refalo has not been charged over the case. When questioned about it, Refalo would not comment and would not even say whether the stone is still at his house. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Courts have almost 2,900 pending compilations of evidence",Mark Laurence Zammit,"There are 2,896 compilations of evidence pending in Maltese courts, figures tabled in parliament on Monday revealed. The overwhelming majority - 2,841 - are pending in the courts of Malta and the rest - 55 - remain pending in Gozo.  Last year, 850 compilations of evidence were concluded in Malta and 104 in Gozo. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard tabled the figures in a reply to a parliamentary question by PN MP Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici. Compilations of evidence are usually lengthy procedures in the criminal court that are known to stretch up to even 10 years. The process takes place at the very beginning of criminal cases. During the process, prosecutors must bring enough evidence to convince the court to accuse the charged person of a crime. New legislation proposed by the government is set to drastically shorten pre-trial proceedings. Figures published by the government show that compilations for drug cases take an average of four-and-a-half years to be concluded and those of other criminal cases stretch to an average of 10 years. Meanwhile, in a reply to a separate question by Mifsud Bonnici, Attard revealed that last year the Maltese courts handed 305 suspended sentences, 204 probation orders and 29 community service sentences. In Gozo, courts handed 14 suspended sentences, 12 probation orders and no community service sentences. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Louis Vuitton thief tracked down through stolen mobile's signal, court told",Edwina Brincat,"A woman who stole a luxury Louis Vuitton bag from an unlocked car in St Paul’s Bay was caught on camera rifling through its contents at a local hotel, a court heard on Monday. Julie Galdes, a 36-year old Qormi resident, jobless and with a drug problem, is alleged to have stolen the bag and around €4,500 worth of items inside it, including an iPhone, Omega watch, Ray Ban sunglasses and €1,300 in cash. She was identified as the woman wearing a pink jacket who crossed Triq it-Turisti on April 18 and snatched the bag from a parked car whose owner had popped into an ironmongery to buy something. When the owner returned, she found the bag missing. She immediately filed a report at the Qawra police station. Footage from the area showed the thief cross the road towards the car and then return, bag in hand. She then entered a room at the Bugibba Holiday Complex, where further footage showed her sifting through the contents of the bag and counting the cash. She took everything, leaving behind the empty bag and credit cards, explained prosecuting Inspector Warren Galea. Two days later, the woman was identified as Galdes. The suspect appeared to be staying at a St Paul’s Bay address but police did not find her there. When officers traced the mobile phone, it pinged at the detox centre. When they tried a second time, it pinged in Qormi. Officers headed to Galdes’ home and promptly arrested her. On Monday, she pleaded not guilty to the solitary charge of aggravated theft. When the court asked whether any of the stolen items had been recovered, the victim’s lawyer, Charles Mercieca, intervened. “Nothing save for the iPhone cover. This phone had a sentimental value that was far greater than the monetary value…We’ve been on a wild goose chase, from St Paul’s Bay to Qormi…We only want the phone,” Mercieca told the court. Defence lawyer Amadeus Cachia initially said his client was ready to cooperate, return the personal belongings and register an admission. He said the accused was battling an addiction issue, asked for a pre-sentencing report before the Drug Court. Magistrate Charmaine Galea said the request for the case to be heard before a Drug Court had to be made at the appropriate stage of proceedings.  The defendant ultimately pleaded not guilty and requested bail. The prosecution objected to bail, since civilian witnesses were still to testify and the accused was jobless, meaning she could commit further offences to fuel her addiction. Moreover investigations were still ongoing and there was fear of tampering with evidence, argued AG lawyer Tilden Tabone. When police asked the suspect to hand back the stolen phone, she said that that was not possible. And when police asked for her to say where it was, she replied, “You’re searching for it. You find it!,” Inspector Galea added. In light of those submissions the court, presided over by magistrate Charmaine Galea, denied bail.

‘Maltese’ Russian jailed in UK over scheme to launder €14 million,| Joanna Demarco and Jacob Borg,"The son of a Russian oil executive who bought Maltese citizenship has been imprisoned in the UK after admitting to laundering more than €14 million in “cash”, together with an associate.  Semen Kuksov, the 24-year-old son of Russian businessman Vladimir Anatolyevich Kuksov, was jailed for five years and seven months in February after admitting to his role in laundering the cash.  Both father and son feature on the latest list of people granted Maltese citizenship in 2022. The elder Kuksov has not been connected to his son’s criminal case. The Kuksovs appear to have been given Maltese citizenship weeks before Malta suspended passport sales to wealthy Russians in the wake of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  Over a year later, Semen Kuksov was charged by the UK’s crown prosecution service with laundering £12 million (around €14 million) in “cash”, together with an associate.  The prosecution accused Kuksov of playing “a leading role in running the illegal enterprise which laundered large sums of criminally derived cash for a fee”.  According to a Crown Prosecution Service’s press release, Kuksov and his associate managed couriers to collect criminal money and deliver the laundered money overseas. They helped launder a total of £12.32 million in the UK and €168,950 in Ireland.  Semen Kuksov admitted to the charges and was jailed for five years and seven months.  He did not respond to a request for comment sent to his lawyer.  A spokesperson for Community Malta Agency, the government entity responsible for administering the passports scheme, said the agency is currently reviewing the official documentation of Semen Kuksov’s case. After being contacted by Times of Malta, Joseph Mizzi, the agency’s CEO, said Community Malta is “seriously considering” advising the minister to initiate the process of revoking Kuksov’s citizenship.  The law governing the citizenship scheme allows the home affairs minister to revoke a passport if within seven years of being granted citizenship, an applicant is sentenced to a jail term that is 12 months or longer. Kuksov’s father Vladimir has been one of the key players in Russia’s oil services industry.  He is a shareholder and former chairman of AKROS, one of the leading companies in the Russian oilfield service and partner of several sanctioned Russian companies such as Lukoil and Gazprom. AKROS itself does not appear on any sanction lists checked by Times of Malta.  Public documents show that Vladimir Kuksov switched the nationality on his UK-registered companies from Russian to Maltese on January 18, 2022.  A number of high-profile Russians have been sanctioned by the EU and US in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kuksov does not appear on any sanction lists checked by Times of Malta.  When contacted for comment, a UK law firm representing Vladimir Kuksov said their client has no comment to make about his son’s case, “but notes that he and his adult son have lived separate lives for some years”.  Kuksov’s lawyers said their client applied for Maltese citizenship “as long ago as 2019, perfectly appropriately”, and underwent the normal lengthy governmental due diligence process, before becoming a Maltese citizen.  Kuksov provided “full appropriate information regarding his wish to become a Maltese citizen when applying in the standard manner to become one”.  The lawyers said their client, like anyone else, was required to update all relevant company filings when becoming a Maltese citizen.  The cash-for-passports scheme, launched in 2014, proved to be an instant hit for Russians.  During its first year of operation, 54.3 per cent of applications were submitted from Russia.  After years of brushing aside the reputational risks inherent in such a scheme, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked renewed scrutiny on who Malta chose to sell European passports to.  In March 2023, the European Commission took legal action against the Maltese government, arguing that granting European citizenship for a “predetermined payment” violates EU law.  The EU’s executive branch said in 2019 that citizenship schemes like Malta’s pose serious money-laundering, tax evasion and corruption risks.  Malta has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the citizenship scheme, which has “robust due diligence processes,” is legal. The government publishes an annual list of people granted Maltese citizenship. However, the list makes no distinction between citizens naturalised through the normal channels, and those who paid for their Maltese passport under the citizenship scheme.

Degiorgio brothers lose case over legal aid lawyers in Daphne murder trial,Matthew Xuereb,"A constitutional court has declared that the Degiorgio brothers, convicted of killing journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, did not have their right to a fair hearing breached when they had legal aid lawyers appointed after they did not manage to find trusted lawyers to represent them. George and Alfred Degiorgio filed the constitutional case complaining that they had been wronged when a legal advisor from the Legal Aid Agency was ""imposed"" on them after their lawyer had renounced the case. They also complained that the new lawyers were not given sufficient time to examine the court documentation and were therefore not in a position to assist and defend them in the best possible way. They pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them and were each sentenced to 40 years in jail. But in a detailed judgment, Madam Justice Audrey Demicoli threw out their case, ruling that it found nothing wrong with the way the criminal court dealt with them, assigning legal representation when they were finding it difficult to find a lawyer willing to represent them. This, along with extending the time for them to prepare a defence by twenty days more than the term established in the law, ensured the “overall fairness of the proceedings”, the judge ruled. In their application, the two brothers argued that they were disadvantaged because their lawyer had renounced the brief weeks before the trial, while the prosecution was fully prepared for the final leg of the case. All their attempts to find another lawyer of choice proved futile since no lawyer would take on such a feat and consequently, the Degiorgios were each given a legal aid lawyer – Simon Micallef Stafrace and Martin Farrugia. But the voluminous evidence compiled throughout the years – more than 15,000 physical and 77,000 electronic documents - made it practically impossible for any lawyer to set up an adequate defence, they claimed. The Degiorgio brothers also complained that their right to a fair hearing was also breached by the extensive media coverage given to their case, meaning that jurors were never in a position to be impartial. In her considerations, Madam Justice Demicoli noted that the criminal court had twice postponed the start of their trial, giving them time to find a lawyer who was ready to take on their case and represent them in court. She said this showed that the court had not rushed to appoint legal aid lawyers but had only done so “as a last resort” because it could not keep postponing the start of the trial in the interest of the principle that justice must be done within a reasonable time. Once the criminal court gave them time to hire a lawyer of their choice, which by their own admission they did not succeed, the court had sufficient grounds to appoint legal aid lawyers, the judge ruled. On the claim that the lawyers did not have enough time to study the case documents, the court noted that they had 40 days to do this. While this was not ideal, the court ruled that this time was sufficient and therefore turned down their claims. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man charged with repeatedly raping his partner,Times of Malta,"A 27-year-old Palestinian man is alleged to have repeatedly raped his partner over the span of several months. Mahmoud Abdelkhadir was arraigned under arrest on Friday and charged with rape, detaining the victim against her will, forcing her into non-consensual sexual acts, grievously injuring her and harassing her, among other charges. Abdelkhadir and the victim, who cannot be named under court order, have children together. The accused pleaded not guilty to all charges. The court, led by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, heard that the man is also alleged to have threatened the woman with violence on multiple occasions. The case came to the police’s attention on April 17, when the police’s Domestic Violence Unit was alerted that a woman had gone to hospital claiming that her partner had assaulted and raped her. She subsequently told police officers that he had raped her several times in the past months. After she gave the police a sworn statement to that effect, officers went to the couple’s home in Cospicua and arrested the man. Prosecutor Cynthia Tomasuolo asked the court to issue a protection order in the woman’s favour and to also protect her identity by ordering a ban on publication of her name. The court agreed to those requests, issuing a four-year protection order and prohibiting the defendant from contacting her. A request by defence lawyer Brandon Lee Muscat to also ban publication of the man’s name was however turned down by the court, after prosecutors said the two do not share the same surname. The defence did not request bail and the accused was remanded in custody. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Delays in transcription of testimonies breaching fundamental rights, judge warns",Claudia Calleja,"A judge has warned that delays in the transcription of testimonies are leading to “serious administrative shortcomings” that are breaching people’s fundamental rights to request bail. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera called on the Justice Minister and the Director of the Criminal Courts to ensure this does not continue happening.  In a written note dated April 16, the judge says that court testimonies made on March 12 – over a month earlier – before the Magistrates’ Court had not yet been transcribed. As a result, she was not in a position to give a ruling on a bail request as the court documents she had in hand were incomplete. She asked that the written note be included in the documents of the case. The case was that of Mario and Charlotte Zammit who, on March 3, were charged with stealing more than €2,300 from a residence in Żejtun. The two were charged with carrying out this robbery on March 1, causing damage during the robbery, as well as violating court rulings. During their arraignment, they were not granted bail. Since then, the compilation of evidence against them started being heard and several witnesses took the stand. The case documents were sent to the Attorney General for review.  Their lawyer, Mark Busuttil, then filed an application for bail before Madam Justice Scerri Herrera. But she could not decide on the matter due to incomplete case documents.

Pensioner admits to threatening building contractor with knife,Claudia Calleja,"A pensioner admitted to threatening a building contractor with a knife in an argument that erupted when he claimed his home was suffering damages due to construction works next door.  The 78-year-old man admitted to trying to seriously injure the contractor with a knife in Żejtun on Thursday.  Police Inspector Doriette Cuschieri said that on Thursday at about 6.50pm a building contractor was at the pensioner’s house because he claimed that he was suffering damage to his home due to construction works going on next door. There was an argument and the pensioner tried to attack the contractor with a knife he grabbed from his house. He was then called into the Żejtun police station and charged in court. The case was put off for judgment to April 29. Meanwhile, the pensioner was granted bail against a €500 deposit and a personal guarantee of €10,000. He was bound not to approach the contractor. Works to build an apartment block are expected to be completed within 10 months.

Leisure Clothing directors claim double jeopardy,Claudia Calleja,"Two directors of the now-shuttered textiles factory Leisure Clothing who were jailed on human trafficking charges are claiming double jeopardy. Leisure Clothing’s managing director Bin Han and marketing director Jia Liu, both Chinese nationals, had each been jailed for six years last year when an appeal court found them guilty of human trafficking.  Han and Liu have now filed an application in the First Hall of the Civil Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction claiming double jeopardy. The law does not allow a person to be charged twice over the same incident. In their application, they noted that in a judgment handed down by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech in 2016, ‘’they had been fined €500 for breaching the Employment and Industrial Relations Act in November 2014. They paid the fine.  In separate proceedings before the Magistrate Courts, they were charged with human trafficking and breaching the employment law. Both cases included the same accused during the same timeframe, were based on the same facts and included the same charge – breaching employment law was included in the human trafficking case. They called on the court to declare that this was in breach of their rights and to annul the appeal judgment. Leisure Clothing was a major textile manufacturer in Malta, sewing garments for high-end labels such as Emporio Armani and Karen Millen. Owned by Chinese firm CICET, it shut down in 2017 following the arrest of the two directors. Leisure Clothing made headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2014 after police raided the factory and accused its director of having exploited hundreds of workers.  The investigation led to a magisterial inquiry, with Chinese and Vietnamese workers testifying that they had been fed ""inedible"" food and lured into coming to Malta with the promise of high wages. A court heard that while employees were paid €70 a month for six 14-hour days per week, managing director Han received a performance bonus of €30,000 a year. A magistrate’s court had initially found Han guilty and acquitted Liu. But Han, who also has Maltese nationality, was given a suspended sentence, meaning he did not spend time behind bars. Last year the criminal appeal court ruled that the two company directors were guilty and sentencing them each to six years in prison. Lawyers Jose Herrera, David Camilleri, Therese Commodini Cachia, Pio Valletta and Jason Azzopardi signed the application.

Vandalised Mosta trees likely to survive damage - Graffitti,Giulia Magri,"The Mosta trees have a “good chance” of surviving despite having holes drilled into their trunks and an unspecified liquid poured around them, Moviment Graffitti said on Friday. Last month the NGO raised the alarm when drilled holes appeared in the trees with an unidentified liquid found around them. These same trees, planted just outside the Mosta Dome, had been spared the chop at the eleventh hour in November.  The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) and the Mosta local council had both filed police reports following the incident.  After urging authorities to keep the public updated about the investigation earlier this week, Moviment Graffitti met with ERA officials near the ficus trees on Friday morning. “Today ERA explained that investigations are underway, both from their end as well as by the police, in order to try to understand who made these holes and caused this harm to the ficus trees,” the statement read.  Graffitti was told by the authority that investigators are currently combing through the many hours of CCTV footage lifted from the area.  Testing is still ongoing to determine the identity of the liquid that was poured into the holes that were drilled in the roots and trunks of the trees.    After the holes were cleaned out from that liquid and its residue, ERA told Graffitti that these were then cleansed with another substance. Following this intervention, the trees can restart being watered normally.  “The good news is that there is a good chance that the trees will survive. Many branches have been burnt. However, it appears that the trees are still alive and new branches are trying to sprout.” The NGO said while they thanked the ERA officials for their update, they are committed to continue following the issue closely. They also encouraged anyone with information about the case, to contact ERA at 2292 3500. Reports can also be submitted anonymously.  The 12 mature ficus trees alongside Constitution Road by the parish church, were at the centre of national attention when activists successfully stopped plans to uproot and transplant them while the Mosta Square was being revamped.  Pruning had already begun when activists, including members of Moviment Graffitti, went on-site to stop further works.  The council then bowed down to pressure and reversed its plans.

"Husband threatened to kill wife unless she handed him money, court told",Edwina Brincat,"A man who allegedly threatened to kill his wife unless she handed him money, was granted bail on Thursday but banned from the matrimonial home by a magistrate. The 52-year old Naxxar resident was arrested on Tuesday after he confronted his wife as she returned from work, having apparently discovered that she was keeping some €40,000 in a safe at home. No sooner had she reached the front door that he emerged from the interconnected garage, demanding that she give him that money. He threatened to kill her unless she did so, prosecutors told the court.  After an argument, he left the scene but later called his father-in-law warning that he would “hear something big.” The wife filed a report at the police Domestic Violence Unit saying that she was fearing for her safety since her husband possessed two firearms. That information prompted the police to take action. An arrest warrant was issued and executed during a late night raid and the weapons were also seized. On Thursday, the man was charged with causing his alleged victim to fear violence as well as insulting and threatening her. He pleaded not guilty and his lawyers requested bail. His elderly father confirmed that the accused could live at his residence if he were to be granted bail. The accused’s wife had no objection to bail as long as he was ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and adequate measures were taken to ensure her protection, her lawyer, Keith Borg informed the court. Magistrate Ann Marie Thake upheld the request, warning the accused that he may not to approach the alleged victim in any way. “You absolutely cannot enter the matrimonial home” she warned. Bail was granted against a deposit of €1000, a personal guarantee of €4000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 5:00am and 9:00pm. The court also issued a protection order in favour of the alleged victim, remaining in force pending the proceedings. Inspector Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel. Lawyer Keith Borg appeared parte civile.

Plans for Mtarfa centre for children with challenging behaviour dropped,Matthew Xuereb,"The government has backpedalled on plans to set up a therapeutic centre for children with behavioural problems in Mtarfa, with Family and Social Solidarity Minister Michael Falzon telling parliament that alternative sites are being considered. He was replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Charles Azzopardi. Mtarfa local council immediately welcomed the news, adding that this vindicated its view that the proposed location was unsuited. The project was announced in March 2022, with the ministry saying the new centre was estimated to cost around €17 million. It had said the centre would be made up of four blocks of six apartments each.   The centre was planned to house 24 minors under the age of 18 convicted by the courts or showing behavioural issues.   Residents had described the project as a juvenile prison rather than a therapeutic centre. The council had said at the time that while it agreed in principle with the need for this project, the small and quiet locality of Mtarfa was not the right place for it. Mtarfa already hosts several governmental and non-governmental entities, including a home for the elderly, three homes that offer services for people with disabilities, a health shelter for people with food-related problems and an international school. The council had noted that the proposed project was to be located next to private residences, close to a primary school and local entities that welcomed children and young people.    In its statement welcoming the news that the project would be taken elsewhere, the council said its position from the outset was that the proposed site at Mtarfa was not suitable. It also stressed that the size of the project was disproportionate to the area in which it was proposed. The Labour-led council thanked the government for understanding the council’s request and stressed that the building should be used for community purposes and by the locality’s voluntary associations, with the external area remaining accessible for public enjoyment.

Bodycams led to drop in attacks on police officers: Home Affairs Minister,Times of Malta,"The introduction of bodycams has seen a drop in attacks on police and baseless allegations, Home Affairs Minister told a meeting organised by EuroCOP. Times of Malta is informed that the number of violent attacks on officers dropped from 66 in 2019 to 36 in 2023. Over five years, a total of 217 cases of violence against officers were recorded: 48 cases in 2020, 31 cases in 2021, and 36 in 2022. When bodycams were introduced in 2021 through a €1 million investment, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà said the gadgets would start being worn for the officers' own protection but also the protection of people they faced, with the footage proving useful in court proceedings.  At the EuroCOP conference, hosted by the Malta Police Union, Minister Byron Camilleri said bodycams have ""increased the protection of officers, and also led to a drop in incidents and baseless allegations"". The European Confederation of Police is the umbrella organisation for 30 police unions and staff organisations in Europe. The government said in a statement that a EuroCOP meeting held in Malta this week focused on the ""alarming increase"" in physical, oral and virtual attacks on officers. The meeting proposed the collection of data about violence against police officers across Europe that would help improve training programmes for officers.

Four charged with scissors attack on barber in Qormi shop,Matthew Xuereb,"A Qormi barber was stabbed with scissors in his shop during a fight between clients, leading to the arraignment of four men. The stabbing took place at around 3pm on April 9 in Triq il-Vittorja. Syrian nationals Alaa Mohamed, 29, Mohamad Mohamad, 32, Abd Alkarim Zidan, 28, and Bashar Mohamad, 29, all residing in Qormi, appeared before Magistrate Nadia Vella on Wednesday. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against them. Inspector Wayne Bonello and lawyer Nicole Marie Sladden from the Office of the Attorney General told the court that two of the men went to the Qormi police station holding bloodstained scissors. They claimed they were attacked, sparking a police investigation. Alaa Mohamed and Mohamad Mohamad were charged with grievously injuring the barber with a sharp and pointed instrument.   Zidan and Bashar Mohamad were charged with being accomplices in the crime. Zidan alone was further charged with holding the barber against his will while all four were charged with causing the victim to fear violence. Bashar Mohamad was also charged with committing a crime while out on bail over a separate case. Defence lawyers representing each of the accused requested bail but the prosecution objected since there were civilian witnesses who still had to testify in the proceedings. Magistrate Vella turned down the request but urged the prosecution to summon the witnesses at the first available opportunity. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Noel Bianco, Martina Herrera, Roberta Bonello,  and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel. Bashar Mohamad is facing separate criminal proceedings over human smuggling. He was originally arrested over his potential involvement in terrorism, which the police found was not the case. He was, however, charged with human smuggling after he was allegedly caught in possession of two Maltese passports which he was planning to use when flying out of Malta to Germany. Only one of them was his and the other belonged to a relative. Investigators believe he was planning to sell the second passport to someone else while abroad so that it could be used for somebody to enter Malta illegally.

Malta key target for burglaries by 'most threatening' organised crime gangs,James Cummings,"Malta is among the five countries most affected by organised criminal gangs carrying out thefts and burglaries, according to the EU’s law enforcement agency. In a recent report, Europol said 33 of the “most threatening” criminal networks specialising in burglaries and robberies mostly target Malta and four other countries, according to data from the nine reporting countries.  The gangs are largely made up of Croatians, Georgians, Italians and Romanians and are mafia-like in operation, the agency said. It noted that while the majority of the most menacing criminal networks count a mix of nationalities among their members, some nationalities, especially Italians, tend to stick together more. “The countries most affected by networks committing burglaries and thefts are France, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. The most represented nationalities in these networks are Croatian, Georgian, Italian and Romanian,” the report said. “The networks are either clan or family-based mobile organised crime groups or ‘Thieves in Law’ [career criminals],” it said, describing such gangs as having “full control” over the criminal process. It added that some networks had also branched out into people trafficking and smuggling drugs, with the role of “scouter” a critical one within the groups’ organisational structure. Characterising Italian mafias as having a “broad reach” across the EU and mostly active outside of Italy in six countries including Malta, Europol said such groups carried out a range of activities including drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. Georgian networks, meanwhile, tend to stick to property crime including burglaries and robberies, and were mainly in Malta and five other countries. In February, Times of Malta reported how Malta had become the hideout of choice for mafia mob bosses and their henchmen following the arrest of the son of a notorious Sicilian mafia leader. Europol’s Decoding the EU’s Most Threatening Criminal Networks report singled out 821 criminal networks operating across the bloc. It said their combined 25,000-strong members had a “severe impact” on the EU, impacting millions of lives. Describing how it identified criminal gangs as the most threatening, Europol characterised them as being particularly agile – able to cover their tracks well and adapt to new challenges from law enforcement – and as having a strong leadership. Their ability to operate internationally, use legal systems to their advantage – for example, for money laundering – and the level of danger they pose to society were also important factors. “Half of the most threatening criminal networks are involved in drug trafficking as their main activity. Other crime areas include fraud, property crime, migrant smuggling and people trafficking,” it said. “Not all criminal networks use violence and corruption to support their businesses, but when they do, it heightens their threat level. These tools mutually reinforce each other and damage the fabric of our society.” Europol collaborated with law enforcement agencies in member states and partner countries outside the EU while preparing the report, published earlier this month.

Woman took uncle's cadaver to bank to take out loan in Brazil,AFP,"Brazilian police have arrested a woman who tried to take out a bank loan for an elderly man she was pushing in a wheelchair - who turned out to be dead. Employees at the Rio de Janeiro bank called emergency services on Tuesday after becoming suspicious when the woman wheeled the man in and requested a loan in his name. When emergency workers arrived, they determined the man was dead, police said in a statement. Police for the precinct of Bangu, on Rio's west side, booked the woman for attempted theft by fraud and defiling a cadaver, they said. Investigations are ongoing to determine how and when the man died. Brazilian media reports said the woman claimed to be the 68-year-old man's niece and sought to take out a loan of 17,000 reais in his name. ""She tried to make it look like he was signing the papers,"" local investigation chief Fabio Luiz told news site G1. ""But he was already dead when he entered the bank."" The woman's lawyer denied the accusations. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Government proposes radical criminal record clean-up,Giulia Magri,"People imprisoned for a range of crimes will have their criminal records struck off in half the time they must currently wait once they serve their term, the government proposed in a white paper on Wednesday. The reform, an electoral pledge, is meant to give offenders a second chance and make it easier for them to find a job and reintegrate into society, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard and Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttiġieġ told a press conference.  Buttigieg explained that the reform is not a carte blanche and certain serious crimes will not be removed from criminal records. Those that won't be eligible include homicide, femicide, crimes against humanity, slander and perjury, recidivism in drug trafficking, recidivism in theft and recidivism in fraud. Crimes against government security will also not be removed from the police conduct.    The proposed reform will also enable offenders to request the removal of an offence from their record if it has subsequently been decriminalised. Those convicted of simple possession of drugs for personal use will be able to request that their crime be removed from their record immediately - extending a provision first introduced for cannabis-related possession to other substances.  Furthermore, those leaving prison may request a supplementary certificate of good conduct, attesting to their good behaviour and courses they would have followed, should that be the case. The certificate will be issued by a board composed of representatives of the police, the correctional facility, the Justice ministry and the Parole board. The certificate would be immediately revoked should the individual commit another crime.  “We have heard many stories of former prison inmates finding it difficult to get a job because their crimes continue to show up on their conduct sheet,"" Buttiġieġ said.   ""These measures are meant to encourage prison inmates to behave well and engage in reform programmes, while also giving potential employers a full picture of job applicants.""  Attard said the length of time that a crime appears on the record will depend on its seriousness and the court sentence.  Currently, sentences with convictions of more than 10 years in prison are removed from the conduct sheet 10 years after the sentence would have been served. That will be cut by half, to five years.   Sentences with a conviction of less than six months will be removed after three months instead of the current six.  ""We believe that in a humane society, everyone makes mistakes and we should provide solutions for those who wish to reintegrate back into society,"" Attard said. The public consultation will be open until May 29.  Attached files  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Thousands of Taylor Swift fans hit by UK ticket scams: Lloyds,AFP,"Thousands of fans of pop megastar Taylor Swift have been hit by a wave of concert ticket scams ahead of her tour in the UK later this year, a British bank said Wednesday. At least 3,000 victims are likely to have been tricked into buying fake tickets since July, with over £1 million ($1.24 million) being lost to fraudsters so far, Lloyds Bank said. The average amount lost by each victim was £332, though in some cases it was more than £1,000.  The bank said more than 90 per cent of reported cases started with fake adverts or posts on Facebook.  Concert ticket scams had risen by 158 per cent since last summer compared to the same period a year earlier, the bank added. US singer Beyonce, British band Coldplay and musician Harry Styles are the artists most commonly used in the targeting, it noted. Across all concert ticket scams, victims were losing £133 on average. A search of Facebook revealed dozens of unofficial groups had been set up, many with tens of thousands of members, specifically for people looking to buy and sell tickets for Swift concerts, Lloyds said. Facebook Marketplace, the social media company’s trading platform, has various listings for tickets at venues nationwide, the bank said. The scams usually involve fake adverts, posts or listings on social media, offering tickets at discounted prices, or access to events which have already sold out at inflated prices.  Victims are asked to pay upfront for the tickets, but once the payment is made, the scammers disappear. This leaves the buyer without the tickets and out of pocket.  “If you’re being asked to pay by bank transfer, particularly from a seller you’ve found on social media, that should immediately set alarm bells ringing,” said Lloyds Bank fraud prevention director Liz Ziegler. “Buying directly from reputable, authorised platforms is the only way to guarantee you’re paying for a genuine ticket. Even then, always pay by debit or credit card for the greatest protection.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

‘Rust’ armourer sentenced to 18 months over deadly on-set shooting,AFP,"The armourer who loaded the gun that killed a cinematographer on the set of the Alec Baldwin movie Rust was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a US court on Monday. Hannah Gutierrez stood impassive as a judge in New Mexico told her she was not remorseful for the October 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins during filming of the budget Western. “You were the armourer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone. You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said. “But for you, Miss Hutchins would be alive. A husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother.” Gutierrez’s 10-day trial for involuntary manslaughter had heard how despite being the person charged with handling on-set firearms, the 26-year-old had repeatedly failed to follow basic safety rules, leaving guns unattended and allowing actors – including Baldwin – to wave weapons around. It also heard how she was responsible for the presence of six live rounds – a movie industry red line – and how she had loaded one of them into the Colt .45 that Baldwin was using.   The weapon discharged as the actor was preparing a scene inside a wooden church, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. “Halyna Hutchins died due to a cascade of safety violations that began with Miss Gutierrez introducing live rounds to the movie set, loading one into a prop gun telling the members of the crew that it was a cold gun,” prosecutor Kari Morrissey told the sentencing hearing in Santa Fe. “That conduct absent responsibility or remorse is deserving of a sentence of 18 months.” ‘Not sorry’ Morrissey told the judge that since her conviction, Gutierrez had made around 200 calls from jail in which she complained that she was being unfairly victimised. “Rather than accept responsibility, she has chosen to place blame on the witnesses who testified against her, me, you, the jurors, the set medic and the paramedics who tried to save Miss Hutchins’ life,” Morrissey said. “Her jail calls... tell us who Miss Gutierrez really is.” Gutierrez sobbed as she begged the court for probation, rather than jail time, but still insisted she was not wholly to blame. “Your Honour, when I took on Rust, I was young and I was naive. But I took my job as seriously as I knew how to, despite not having proper time, resources and staffing. “The jury has found me in part at fault for this god-awful tragedy. But that doesn’t make me a monster. That makes me human,” she said.   The judge dismissed the plea. “I did not hear you take accountability in your allocution,” Sommers said. “You said you were sorry... but not... for what you did.  “It was your attorney that had to tell the court that you were remorseful. The word ‘remorse’: a deep regret coming from a sense of guilt for past wrongs; That’s not you.” The movie’s star Baldwin, who was also a producer, faces his own involuntary manslaughter trial in July. He denies the charge. If convicted, he too faces a possible 18 months in prison. Dave Halls, the film’s safety coordinator and assistant director, who handed Baldwin the loaded gun, agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors last year and was sentenced to six months’ probation. The tragedy sent shockwaves through Hollywood and led to calls for a complete ban on the use of weapons on movie sets. Industry insiders, however, insisted that rules were already in place to prevent such incidents and that those working on Rust had not followed them. The filming of Rust was halted by Hutchins’ death but completed last year on location in Montana. The cinematographer’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, who has already settled a wrongful death suit with Rust producers, served as an executive producer. No release date has been announced.

Australia offers French mall stabbing hero citizenship,AFP,"Australia's prime minister on Tuesday suggested a visiting Frenchman who heroically fended off a knife-wielding Sydney mall attacker using only a bollard could be offered citizenship. Damien Guerot has been dubbed ""bollard man"" and a ""hero"" of Saturday's attack that killed six people and wounded a dozen more.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese singled Guerot out for praise on Tuesday, thanking him for his ""extraordinary bravery"" in confronting Joel Cauchi on an escalator and preventing the 40-year-old attacker from reaching more victims. ""I say this to Damien Guerot who is dealing with his visa applications, that you are welcome here, you are welcome to stay for as long as you like,"" Albanese said. ""This is someone who we would welcome becoming an Australian citizen, although that would of course be a loss for France. We thank him for his extraordinary bravery."" ""It says a lot about the nature of humanity at a time when we are facing difficult issues, that someone who is not a citizen of this country stood bravely at the top of those escalators and stopped this perpetrator from getting onto another floor and potentially inflicting further carnage on citizens,"" Albanese said. Australians have been shocked by the Saturday attack that took place in a busy shopping mall in the city's eastern suburbs. Five women and one Pakistani security guard were killed during the rampage, which has not been blamed on terrorism. Police are investigating whether Cauchi, who had a history of mental illness, targeted women specifically. But Australians and Albanese took some succour from strangers aiding each other during the attack and from the bravery of policewoman Amy Scott, who acting alone, tracked Cauchi down and shot him dead.   ""I think that on Saturday we saw some of the best of human character at the same time as we saw such devastating tragedy,"" Albanese said.

'He's a saint when sober': stabbing victim refuses to testify against accused,Times of Malta,"A man allegedly stabbed by his wife’s stepbrother has refused to testify against him, saying he does not want to see the ""saint"" in jail. Joseph Seychell declined to testify against Robert Frendo when the case against Frendo resumed on Monday morning, telling the court “I don’t want to see him in jail... he’s been living with me and my wife for almost our entire 41-year marriage”. Seychell said Frendo was usually a “saint” who went off the rails when he drank alcohol. The case concerns a February 2024 incident at Seychell’s Paola home, when Frendo, 63, is alleged to have stabbed the 69-year-old Seychell 13 times at around lunchtime. Seychell was grievously injured in the incident while Frendo sustained slight injuries. The accused is pleading not guilty to criminal charges. When the case resumed on Monday, prosecutors and defence lawyers argued over whether Seychell was legally obliged to testify in the case. According to the law, people can choose not to testify if the two are married or cohabiting. Defence lawyers argued that the definition of “cohabiting” is broad and that Seychell and Frendo qualify. Prosecutors disagreed and emphasised that the two are not related. Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, who is presiding over the case, must now decide whether to allow Seychell to sit out testimony, or force him to take the witness stand. The case resumes on April 29. Inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo lead the prosecution, along with attorney general lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Nathaniel Falzon. Frendo is being defended by lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar. Seychell was represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Bishop stabbed during ceremony in Sydney, suspect held",AFP,"Updated 3.05pm Four people are being treated for ""non-life threatening injuries"" after a stabbing at a church service in Sydney on Monday, emergency services said. Australian police said they had arrested one man. The incident came two days after a man with a knife killed six at a shopping mall in the east of the city. A video stream showed Monday's gruesome attack at an Assyrian church unfold in real time. The video showed a man dressed in black approaching a bishop at the dais, raising his right arm and slashing at the preacher with a knife, prompting panic and screams among the congregation.  Several people appeared to rush to help subdue the attacker. The ambulance service told AFP that four men aged between 20 and 70 were being treated for injuries, including lacerations.  ""The injured individuals suffered non-life threatening injuries and were treated by New South Wales Ambulance paramedics before being conveyed to hospital,"" police said. ""A male was arrested and remains in police custody."" AFP verified the video as being taken at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in Sydney's western suburb of Wakeley. The neighbourhood is a hub for Sydney's small Christian Assyrian community, many of whom fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria. The church holds a prayer session every Monday evening. Police said they began to receive emergency calls from the scene ""about 7.10 pm"". They urged the public to avoid the area. Australians are still reeling from Saturday's stabbing, which was carried out by a 40-year-old man with a history of mental illness. In that attack, videos shared on social media showed unshaven itinerant Joel Cauchi pursuing mostly female victims as he rampaged through the vast, crowded Westfield shopping complex in Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon. A black ribbon was projected onto the Sydney Opera House on Monday as a mark of respect for the victims.

Police probe Joel Cauchi's targeting of women in Sydney mall attack,AFP,"Australian police said Monday they are investigating why a 40-year-old man with mental illness appeared to target women as he roamed a Sydney shopping mall with a large knife, killing six people and injuring a dozen more. Videos shared on social media showed unshaven itinerant Joel Cauchi pursuing mostly female victims as he rampaged through the vast, crowded Westfield shopping complex in Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon. Five of the six victims killed were women, as were most of those wounded.  ""The videos speak for themselves don't they, and that's certainly a line of inquiry for us,"" New South Wales police commissioner Karen Webb said. ""That's obvious to me, it's obvious to detectives, that that seems to be an area of interest - that the offender had focused on women and avoided men,"" she told national broadcaster ABC. Webb stressed that police could not know what was in the mind of the attacker. ""That's why it's important now that detectives spend so much time interviewing those who know him."" Cauchi's Facebook profile said he came from Toowoomba, near Brisbane, and had attended a local high school and university. His parents say he had suffered from mental health issues since he was a teenager.   The last of Cauchi's six victims was identified Monday as Yixuan Cheng, a young Chinese woman who was a student at the University of Sydney. The other women killed were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, and a new mother whose wounded nine-month-old baby is in hospital. The mother, 38-year-old Ashlee Good, handed her bleeding baby girl to strangers in desperation before being rushed to hospital where she died of her injuries.  Her baby, named Harriet, is in a serious condition in a Sydney hospital but is expected to improve, health authorities said.  The only man killed was 30-year-old Pakistani Faraz Tahir, who had been working as a security guard when he was stabbed.  A total of eight people wounded in the assault remain in hospital - some in critical condition - after four were released in the past 24 hours, health authorities said. Cauchi's assault, which lasted about half an hour, was brought to an end when solo police inspector Amy Scott tracked him down and shot him dead.  Scott - hailed as a hero by police and political leaders - was spending time with her family to deal with the ""very traumatic matter"", the state police chief said. In a statement, Cauchi's parents offered thoughts for the victims and said their son's actions were ""truly horrific"".  ""We are still trying to comprehend what has happened."" The parents also sent a message to the officer who killed their son. ""She was only doing her job to protect others and we hope she is coping alright,"" they said. Cauchi is believed to have travelled to Sydney about a month ago and hired a small storage unit in the city, according to police. It contained personal belongings, including a boogie board.   He had been living in a vehicle and hostels, and was only in sporadic contact with his family via text messages, his parents said. A mound of flowers grew outside the Bondi shopping centre as people paid their respects to the victims.  Flags across the country flew at half-mast in mourning.  The Sydney Opera House is to be lit up with black ribbon in the evening. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to the families of some victims. ""The gender break-down is of course concerning - each and every victim here is mourned,"" he told ABC radio, promising a ""comprehensive"" police investigation. The prime minister also pointed the finger at people who spread false information about the attack. ""What social media has done is make everyone a publisher and some mainstream media also spread some misinformation,"" he said. While some social media users falsely attributed the attack to terrorism, an Australian broadcaster had to apologise for wrongly identifying a 20-year-old student as the perpetrator. A public coronial inquiry will be held into the attack, New South Wales state premier Chris Minns told reporters. It will look into the police response and criminal investigation, but also the killer's past interactions with state health authorities, he said.

Fugitive charged with Naxxar armed robbery is freed by court,Edwina Brincat,"A fugitive accused of involvement in an armed robbery in Naxxar two years ago and who was extradited from Croatia last month, regained his freedom on Sunday after his lawyers challenged the validity of his arrest.  The decision delivered by the Criminal Court following an urgent hearing resulted in the immediate release of Vladimir Pajic - a 28-year-old Serbian national, who was hauled back before the Maltese courts on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant.  The man was previously out on bail while facing criminal proceedings before the Magistrates’ Courts alongside two accomplices in relation to the violent robbery which had taken place at a Naxxar apartment in November 2022.  But Pajic absconded after last signing the bail book in October last year.  Some time later, following a call by the Maltese authorities, the wanted man was arrested by Croatian police when trying to cross the border into Serbia.  He was charged before a Croatian court which concluded that the request for Pajic’s extradition was only partly justified.  The Maltese authorities’ request was based on the fact that Pajic was to face prosecution for aggravated theft, involvement in a criminal conspiracy and for allegedly breaching bail by absconding.  However “failure to appear by a person released on bail” was not a criminal offence under Croatian law. Therefore, the Croatian court made it clear that although it was upholding the request for extradition, this was not being done on the basis of that third ground.  Once back in Malta, Pajic was freshly charged for allegedly breaching bail.  His defence team immediately voiced doubt over the charge and a translation of the Croatian text subsequently confirmed the defence’s concern.  The Croatian court made it clear that Pajic was not to be surrendered over the alleged breach of bail.  That fact was acknowledged by Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit who threw out the prosecution’s case while remanding Pajic in custody and directing the prosecution to “ascertain that the accused [be] brought before that [other] court [presiding over the robbery case] so that those proceedings may continue”.  But following closely upon that judgment, Pajic’s lawyers filed an Habeas Corpus application challenging the validity of the accused’s continued arrest.  The application was filed before the Criminal Court in the records of the robbery case and an urgent hearing was scheduled for Sunday, given the extraordinary nature of the procedure.  After hearing testimony by prosecuting Inspector Lydon Zammit and submissions by the parties, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera delivered a decree upholding the defence’s request.  The judge observed that a true copy of documentation proving the existence of a valid EAW was not made available in court.  Lacking that necessary documentation, the court could not verify the technicalities of the EAW. Consequently it had no option but to order the applicant’s immediate release since the records available did not prove that his detention was valid, decreed the judge.  Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi, Jessica Formosa and Charlon Gouder are counsel to Pajic.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Woman registered as ‘totally paralysed’ walked to interview, received benefits",Mark Laurence Zammit,"A woman who fraudulently claimed her limbs were “permanently and totally paralysed” was awarded disability benefits anyway, despite walking normally into her interview before the government’s medical board. Sources close to the investigation said the woman had been receiving monthly severe disability benefits she was not entitled to for almost five years before the police called her in for questioning last month. It is the latest in a series of revelations into a massive, years-long racket that saw hundreds of people receive €450 monthly payments from the social security department claiming they had severe disabilities they did not actually suffer from. Like scores of other fraudulent cases, her application for the benefit was filled in and signed by popular family doctor and then-Labour MP Silvio Grixti in 2019. The severe disability marked on her application was: “Permanent total paralysis or permanent total severe malfunction or permanent total disease, whether through amputation or otherwise, of both upper or lower limbs.” The woman suffered from no such condition and entered the interview before the medical board walking and using her arms and legs normally. The board greenlighted her application. The case raises serious questions on how doctors on the medical board could have missed the stark fact that the applicant was not paralysed, much less amputated, with physicians telling Times of Malta there is no way anyone – let alone a doctor – could have failed to notice if a person with such a severe condition came before them. In a reply to questions, the director general of the Social Security department – Grazio Barbara – would not explain how the medical board failed to notice it and would not comment on whether the department suspects some doctors on the board were in on the racket. He said the “allegation cannot be verified as the department is not aware of the person’s identity”.  RELATED STORIES  Barbara said the investigation was concluded and published,  and “the recommendations made are being considered and mostly implemented, especially those concerning the medical boards”. Questions were also sent to the police, asking whether they were investigating members of the medical board or any official who is working or used to work at the social policy ministry at the time. The questions remained unanswered by the time of writing. Sources said that when questioned last month, the woman told police she had suffered fractures in her back from an accident the previous year, but she was never paralysed in her arms or legs. She also told police she was not aware that her application and the forged certificates that Grixti attached to it claimed she had that specific severe disability. She also said she walked into the interview before the medical board thinking her doctor had only applied to get her the benefit because of her back injury. She said she did not recall the doctors asking her any questions about the paralysis. The interview only lasted a few minutes, following which the board approved her disability benefit which she started receiving monthly shortly afterwards.  RELATED STORIES  It is unclear whether any of the doctors on the medical board who greenlighted fraudulent applications were in on the racket. Days after Times of Malta revealed the scandal last September, several of them spoke on condition of anonymity to insist they too were cheated and were as shocked as everyone else to learn about the scam. They defended their actions, claiming there was no way they could have detected the fraud “because it was designed in a way that makes it impossible for the board members to know if an application was fraudulent”. The medical board is made up of 19 doctors whose names are publicly available. However, not all members of the board take part in every interview, and it is yet unclear which doctors certified which applications. Only patients with extremely severe and specific disabilities are eligible for such benefits and not only do they need to have an application filled out by their doctor – it must also be accompanied by several medical certificates signed by specialist physicians and consultants. The application containing all documents then goes before the medical board tasked with interviewing each applicant to confirm they are genuinely eligible for the benefit. Yet, this case is not the first time the racket seemed to seamlessly bypass the checks and balances, despite the absurd circumstances which have, so far, come to light. In October, Times of Malta revealed that another one of the alleged disability benefit fraudsters was employed as a minister’s driver while receiving the benefit for claiming he had epilepsy. He also had no driving licence. Sources close to the investigation said that in such instances, several stark red flags went unnoticed by a string of officials who were supposed to oversee the process. Hundreds have so far been charged in court for illicitly receiving the benefits and most of them are admitting to the charges and agreeing to return their ill-gotten gains, thus getting off with a suspended sentence for defrauding the government. Last week, Grixti and four other people were also charged in court with playing a key role in the racket that is believed to have cost taxpayers as much as €6 million. Police combing through a laptop belonging to Grixti told court they found document templates bearing other doctors’ names indicative of document forgery. A former cybercrime unit officer said he found more than 400 files that were deemed relevant to the investigation on the laptop. A top social services department official told the court that the earliest recorded case in the racket dated back to 2016. The department had so far blocked payments to 321 recipients, he said. Some of those might not yet have been charged. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Charged with breaching three bail decrees but arrest is declared illegal,Matthew Xuereb,"A man charged with breaching three bail decrees walked out of court freely on Saturday after a magistrate declared his arrest illegal because the police failed to observe the letter of the law. Magistrate Nadine Lia upheld arguments by the defence that the police failed to follow the law when they arrested the man following a traffic accident. Ransdon Debono, 20, from Qormi, was arrested at the police station when he showed up to sign one of his bail books. He was arrested over his alleged involvement in a traffic accident on March 6. However, the court found that the police failed to trigger a technical detail in the law, which necessitates the immediate notification of the arrest to the duty magistrate when a suspect is arrested at a police station. The court heard how the police were investigating a traffic accident that took place at Blue Grotto Avenue in Żurrieq. Debono’s father claimed to have been driving but when the police analysed CCTV footage, they realised that a person with a similar stature to his son, the defendant, was driving the car at the time of the crash. When Debono reported to the police station to sign his bail book, he was arrested and a subsequent search at his residence yielded clothes similar to the ones worn by the driver of the Mazda Demio involved in the accident. He was arraigned under arrest on Saturday but when questioned by defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adriana Zammit, it emerged the police had not immediately informed the magistrate of the arrest as the law required. Article 355 of the criminal code provides that where an inspector has reasonable suspicion that the person who attended voluntarily at the police station may have committed an offence subject to imprisonment, he may arrest him without a warrant and inform him of his arrest accordingly. The law also states that the time of the arrest shall be immediately recorded and the magistrate should be immediately informed. It emerged that none of this was done which meant Magistrate Lia declared the arrest illegal and ordered his immediate release. Debono pleaded not guilty to driving without a valid driving licence or insurance cover, relapsing and breaching the conditions of three bail decrees issued in March and September 2022. Police inspector Francesca Calleja prosecuted. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Scammers target Ultimate customers with fake cheap deal on kettles,Giulia Magri,"Popular home appliance shop Ultimate is warning customers to be wary of a fake social media account pretending to be the shop and promoting cheap €2.35 designer kettles.  Fraudsters are advertising the scam on a Facebook page purporting to be Ultimate and providing customers with the chance to buy a Smeg kettle for only €2.35.  Locally, the price of a 1.7 litre Smeg kettle can vary between €175 and €198.  “The surplus of goods, caused by the decision of Ultimate to stop sales in some regions, allows us to offer you the best prices,” the fake profile says.  The posts promoting the too-good-to-be-true promotion also had comments written by fake profiles praising the good service and fantastic promotion.  A link in the post takes users to a website claiming to be SMEG's, asking users to answer three questions, before submitting their personal details and paying a €2.35 fee to receive their product. Customers noted that the confirmation email was sent from an address that was not Ultimate's. Home appliance shop Ultimate took to social media to warn customers about the fake page and scam.    Ultimate manager Matthew Cutajar told Times of Malta that the outlets have been bombarded with phone calls from customers, either claiming to have fallen for the scam or asking if the deal is true. He has filed several reports to Facebook and also reported the scam to the police. Cutajar said customers and people on social media must be wary of deals that are ""too good to be true"" and to do their research before purchasing.  ""We do not even sell any Smeg products,"" he said. ""Such scams are a concern for us, as we are put in a bad light and we do not wish to lose our reputation with customers.""

Paris police chief says winning crime fight at Eiffel Tower,AFP,"The head of the Paris police department said that crime had fallen significantly around the Eiffel Tower and other tourist hotspots ahead of the Olympics later this year. Laurent Nunez told AFP that the deployment of extra police had helped reduce incidents of robbery and assault around the Eiffel Tower where the alleged rape of two foreign tourists caused a public outcry last year. ""We've had excellent results in this area as well as other tourist zones in Paris,"" he told AFP at the foot of the Eiffel Tower on Friday, saying that several dozen police were on the ground around the monument throughout the day.  The number of reported physical assaults fell by 58% to 21 incidents in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period of 2023, while reported crimes involving property, which includes theft, fraud and vandalism, fell by 18% to 170 incidents, he said. ""There are controversies, people talking about it being a lawless area or cut-throat. It's not at all,"" he added. A Brazilian and a British tourist reported being raped on the Champs de Mars park in front of the Eiffel Tower last year, shocking many Parisians and leading to criticism from opposition politicians in the capital. ""We will continue to have a very significant police presence in this area which remains one of my priorities for the whole of the Paris region because it's the image of Paris, it's where millions of people come each year,"" Nunez added. The quarterly crime statistics include only reported crimes, with the actual number of incidents likely to be higher.  The French capital is racing to prepare for the Olympics which start on July 26 and the Paralympics from August 28. Around 10 million visitors are expected, with the capital sprucing up its most popular areas and moving migrants and homeless people out - to the dismay of some charities. ""Paris will sparkle, Paris will be beautiful, Paris will be ready to welcome the world,"" Paris deputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told reporters on Friday, predicting that ""Olympics-mania"" would soon emerge. He said there had been hundreds of projects around Paris aimed at improving the city's appearance, many of which would be unveiled in the weeks ahead. ""It's normal when you have people around to your house, you want to tidy up your bedroom and living room,"" fellow deputy mayor in charge of sport, Pierre Rabadan, explained.

Police to start extradition process for Italian charged with drug trafficking,Claudia Calleja,"A magistrate has ordered police to initiate extradition proceedings to bring an Italian man to Malta after he failed to turn up for a court sitting in which he is facing drug trafficking charges. Magistrate Elaine Rizzo ordered the police to do “anything allowed by law” for Gennaro Russo to be extradited to Malta. It is believed he is in Italy. Russo - a café owner - was arrested in December 2021 after being found in possession of cocaine and cannabis. Russo, of Naples but resident in St Paul’s Bay, was stopped while driving in Naxxar. A search yielded cocaine, cannabis, cash and two mobile phones in a bag. A further search in his house and two garages in Msida yielded some 1.5 kilos of cocaine and 15 kilos of cannabis worth over €450,000. Some €250,000 in cash was also found.  The accused pleaded not guilty to trafficking and aggravated possession of cocaine and cannabis as well as other charges including money laundering. He was granted bail in February of 2022 on the third attempt.  Inspectors Justine Grech and Mark Anthony Mercieca are prosecuting.

Elderly home carer charged with sexually harassing underage student at work,Claudia Calleja,"A carer at a Fgura home for the elderly has been charged with the sexual harassment of a 17-year-old exchange student while at work. The man - 44-year-old Indian national Kasu Haridasan - pleaded not guilty to harassing the young Spanish woman who was a minor at the time of the alleged crime. Magistrate Elaine Rizzo heard how on April 5 the young woman went to the Paola police station and said that she was an Erasmus student who worked at Dar San Ġużepp in Fgura as part of her preparation to become a carer.  She said that on March 28 she had gone to the bathroom to get a bucket of water. She claimed the accused turned up behind her, hugged her, kissed her neck and then signalled to her to kiss him on the lips. She left the bathroom. The prosecution objected to the man’s bail request, but lawyer Wilfrid Buttigieg argued that the accused had been living in Malta for four years with his wife and their two young children. He had a job and a registered rental contract. Keeping him in custody would have “a disastrous” impact on his family as they would end up with no income. Apart from that, he had a clean criminal record and the alleged victim had left the island so he could not contact her and tamper with evidence. The magistrate granted him bail against a €2,500 deposit and a personal guarantee of €6,000. A protection order was issued in favour of the young woman.

Bouncer acting in self-defence not guilty of injuring customer harassing dancer,Edwina Brincat,"A court found a bouncer not guilty of grievously injuring a gentlemen’s club customer who harassed a female dancer. The man, the court held, was legitimately defending himself. Carmelo Zammit, an assistant manager and security officer at the Paceville club, found himself at the receiving end of a violent attack by a male customer who was causing trouble and reacted aggressively when asked to leave the premises.  On March 9, 2022, Youssef Salem was drinking at the bar, banging on the counter and harassing one of the dancers who worked at the club.  Zammit sensed that the woman was upset and needed help. She appeared to be on the verge of tears, as the customer reached out to touch her thighs.  That was when Zammit approached the man, tapping him on the shoulder and asking if “everything was okay"". The customer turned to face Zammit, shook his head and reacted angrily, swearing and kicking over the table and chairs.  He flung a bar stool at the bouncer who ordered the aggressor to leave.  But the man punched Zammit in the eyes.  Four police officers who were called in by the club owner later testified that Zammit’s eyes were “swollen like a ball"".  Dizzy and unable to see clearly, the bouncer tried to fend off the attack as Salem grabbed his neck, almost choking him.  That was when another customer intervened to break up the attack, shouting “leave him”. Zammit managed to free himself, pushing away the aggressor and pinning him to the floor, while calling out to his boss to dial the police.  When help arrived, Salem was found lying unconscious outside on the street.  He had suffered several facial injuries, including a fractured nose, a cut on the back of his head and bruising.  At that stage, Zammit was considered to be the victim. The suspected aggressor was Salem.  However, the bouncer was subsequently charged with grievously injuring the customer, involvement in an accidental fight as well as assaulting the alleged victim. He pleaded not guilty.  When assessing the evidence, the court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that the alleged victim never testified because he had left Malta and was never tracked down.  However, eyewitnesses corroborated the accused’s version of the dynamics of the incident that night.  The version those witnesses gave to police shortly after the incident matched their testimonies later in court.  When all was considered, the court concluded that the alleged victim had attacked the accused.  There was no argument about that: The man was behaving aggressively and continued to do so not only by throwing furniture about but also by punching Zammit, grabbing his neck and hitting him with a stool.  He was so aggressive that a third party had to step in to stop the attack, it added. The defence argued there was no evidence that Zammit was responsible for the injuries suffered by Salem.  The court did not agree with that argument: There was little doubt that the alleged victim had been injured during the scuffle with the bouncer.  However, when all was considered, the court was convinced that the accused acted in legitimate self-defence. Salem’s injuries “undoubtedly followed [his own] manifestation of violence”. In no way was he provoked. All witnesses affirmed that the alleged victim had been behaving aggressively even before Zammit intervened, banging on the counter, drinking, harassing the dancer and threatening to douse her with his drink.  The accused could not but react to defend himself and his actions were defensive rather than intended to attack the alleged victim. His behaviour was neither excessive nor unreasonable, court added. Turning his back and leaving the place was not a realistic option either, given the circumstances.  In light of all considerations, the court cleared Zammit of all criminal wrongdoing.

Fugitive caught in Croatia cannot be found guilty of breaching bail court rules,Edwina Brincat,"A fugitive extradited to Malta from Croatia could not be found guilty of breaching bail because “failure to appear” when out on bail was not a criminal offence under Croatian law, a court has ruled.  Vladimir Pajic, a 28-year-old Serbian national, had been granted bail while facing criminal proceedings over his alleged involvement in an armed robbery at a Naxxar apartment in November 2022. But he vanished after last signing the bail book on October 21, 2023.  He was subsequently arrested by Croatian police while trying to cross the border into Serbia and was charged before the courts in that country on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued by Maltese authorities who sought his extradition.  Pajic was one of two aggressors who allegedly held up a Dutchman and a French woman at gun and knife point in Naxxar two years ago, making off with cash and other belongings worth over €2,000. It later turned out that the female ‘victim’ was allegedly an accomplice, facilitating the crime. The woman, Milica Kurcubic, was charged alongside Pajic and Victor Markovic and all three pleaded not guilty.  But while proceedings are still ongoing over that episode, Pajic slipped out of the country.  Following his arrest in Croatia, Pajic did not consent to extradition.  The foreign court observed that the Maltese authorities wanted Pajic to face proceedings for aggravated theft, involvement in a criminal conspiracy and for breaching bail.  However, the Croatian court observed that the request by the “Republic of Malta” was only “partially justified” because the offence of “failure to appear by a person released on bail…[did] not exist in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia”.  Consequently, Pajic was surrendered to Malta on the basis of the first two alleged crimes and not the breach of bail.  But when hauled back before the Magistrates’ Court last month, Pajic was charged with breaching bail.  His lawyers promptly voiced doubt over whether that charge was covered by the Croatian judgment - a copy of which was presented by the prosecution. Presiding magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit appointed an expert to translate the document so that the matter could be clarified.  On that occasion, Pajic was remanded in custody.  The translation left no room for doubt. The Croatian court clearly stated that Pajic was not to be surrendered over the alleged breach of bail.  Extracts from that decision were cited by Magistrate Stafrace Zammit when delivering judgment on Thursday. “The Croatian court made it clear that since the offence of breaching a bail decree did not exist under Croatian law, then [the accused] could not be extradited and prosecuted for that offence in Malta, let alone be punished for that offence,” said the court. However, the European Arrest Warrant was to remain in force with respect to the other crimes for which Pajic was facing proceedings before another Magistrate, namely the armed robbery. “….it was to be ascertained that the accused is brought before that [other] court so that those proceedings may continue,” the magistrate concluded.

Watch: OJ and the white Ford Bronco - the world's most famous police chase,AFP,"It was the car chase that brought a nation screeching to a halt. On June 17, 1994, a white Ford Bronco containing a fugitive OJ Simpson led a convoy of police cars down southern California's freeways - and 95 million Americans couldn't take their eyes off it. Coverage of massive sporting events like the NBA finals and US Open was interrupted with footage of the chase, while Domino's Pizza reported record delivery orders from viewers unwilling to miss a single moment.    That moment captured by hovering TV helicopters and breathless newsmen, and broadcast around the world, remains an obsession for some. But for one viewer, it held a particular fascination. ""We were all huddled around and watching, no one was breathing - we just stood there in complete awe and fascination,"" recalled Kim Goldman, in a 2019 podcast marking the 25th anniversary of the chase. ""It was weird because there (were) people hoping that he would kill himself... And my dad and I just didn't - we wanted him to be brought in and held accountable."" Five days earlier, Goldman's brother Ron had been stabbed to death alongside Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Simpson was famously acquitted in 1995 by a Los Angeles jury in a case decried by many as a media circus which became known as the ""Trial of the Century."" The former football star and Hollywood actor's acquittal was greeted with disbelief by many Americans, with opinion on the Black athlete's guilt divided sharply along racial lines. Simpson was later found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and ordered to pay damages to Goldman's family totaling $33.5 million. The majority of that remained unpaid. Simpson maintained his innocence and always denied he was trying to flee during the famous Bronco chase, even though he ignored a police deadline to turn himself in. He told a LAPD detective over the phone during the slow-speed pursuit to ""let them all know I wasn't running,"" but rather visiting Nicole's grave. A duffel bag containing Simpson's passport and cash -- as well as a gun -- found by police in the car led many to question this, but was never submitted as evidence by the prosecution. For Geoffrey Alpert, a professor at University of South Carolina who studies police chases, Simpson's celebrity heightened a deep-rooted fascination with the idea of a dangerous pursuit. ""We're waiting for the collision. No one wants anyone to die but we certainly like to see some mayhem,"" he told AFP in 2019, comparing televised chases to wildly popular Nascar races. ""The media has a broader fascination with that kind of event in the States than anywhere else,"" he added. ""It goes back to the days of horseback riding when someone would rob a bank and the sheriff would jump on his horse and chase him."" The car itself - owned by Simpson's friend Al Cowlings, who was driving during the pursuit - is on display in a Tennessee crime museum. A Los Angeles tour company reportedly explored the idea of offering rides in the vehicle up and down the same freeways. To the disappointment of fans who gathered on overpasses along the chase route that day with signs saying ""Run O.J. Run"" and ""Go O.J.,"" Simpson eventually surrendered.  But for Goldman, that did not lead to any closure.  Simpson was released from jail in 2017 after serving nine years behind bars for an unrelated armed robbery. At the time of his death this week, he was living in Las Vegas, where he was regularly spotted playing golf. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man who allegedly stabbed cousin in kitchen granted bail,Edwina Brincat,"A man who allegedly stabbed his cousin on the shoulder with a knife and turned himself in at a police station shortly afterwards has been granted bail/ The incident allegedly took place a week ago inside the kitchen of a Żebbuġ residence which the victim shared with two others. The injured man walked into the Żebbuġ police station on April 4 evening, telling the duty officers that he had been stabbed in the shoulder and asking for medical assistance. An ambulance rushed him to hospital. A police sergeant who followed the ambulance team could not get much information from the alleged victim who was unable to speak. However, the man’s sister, who had been in another area of his home when the incident took place, identified Abdelaziz Lakehal - a 49-year-old Moroccan national - as the alleged aggressor.  While investigators were tracking down the suspect’s address, they received a call from the Ħamrun police station informing them that the suspected aggressor had just turned himself in.  On Thursday he was charged with grievously injuring the alleged victim who was present at the arraignment, accompanied by his sister. The accused pleaded not guilty. The victim took the witness stand, explaining that he wanted to forgive the accused.  Parte civile lawyer Noel Bianco cited article 543(e) of the Criminal Code that allowed victims of domestic violence to request the court to stay proceedings against the aggressor.  However, when asked directly by the court about the accused’s home address, it turned out that the victim did not know where his alleged aggressor lived. The court waived aside the request.  The defence then requested bail.  AG lawyer Etienne Savona objected, arguing that there were civilian witnesses still to testify and that the knife injuries were grievous.  Moreover, the accused had been in Malta for only around a month.  Defence counsel Colin Galea rebutted that the accused had lived in Malta previously before returning recently and had an expired Maltese ID card.  The man’s conduct sheet was clean and his sister, who has been living in Malta for 30 years, was willing to step in as a third-party guarantor.  Asked about the number of civilian witnesses, prosecuting Inspector John Sammut confirmed that the alleged aggressor and victim were alone in the kitchen when the incident took place.  Third parties were “upstairs,” implying no one else had witnessed the scene.  Defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud stressed that in light of that information, coupled with the fact that the victim wanted to forgive the accused, there was no reason why bail should be denied.  While the accused, assisted by an Arab-speaking interpreter, sat in the dock, head bent low and wiping away tears, his sister confirmed she was willing to guarantee that he would abide by bail conditions.  After hearing submissions, presiding Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi upheld the request against a deposit of €2,000, a personal guarantee of €13,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 8pm and 6am.  AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech prosecuted together with Inspector John Sammut.  Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea were defence counsel. Lawyer Noel Bianco appeared parte civile.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Prison warder again cleared of raping underage inmate,Matthew Xuereb,"An ordeal faced by a prison warder who was “spitefully” accused of sexually abusing two underage inmates, raping one of them, at the juvenile prison in 2018 has finally come to an end after a court of appeal confirmed his acquittal. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera threw out an appeal filed by the Attorney General, who was insisting on a conviction, after ruling that the case had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt and that there were several aspects of the investigation and prosecution that pointed towards a made-up story. Joseph Zammit was charged in November 2022 with sexually abusing and raping the then-15-year-old minor, an inmate at the female division in the youth section of the Corradino Correctional Facility. The girl had first told a fellow inmate about the warder’s unwelcome advances and sexually loaded comments. Her claims led to an internal inquiry against the then-52-year-old father whose career at the prison facility spanned 23 years. The inquiry was never concluded after the police took over the investigation. He was subsequently charged with a raft of offences including sexual activity with the minor, harassing the minor and her friend, seeking sexual favours, and engaging in acts of sexual intimacy, which offences he was duty bound to prevent. He pleaded not guilty upon arraignment and protested his innocence ever since, testifying in the proceedings rather than opt for silence. The girl had claimed that Zammit used to comment about her figure while she was showering and described how she had oral sex with him some six or seven times. She also supplied details about the rape, which she claimed took place inside a washroom. Her friend also insisted that the accused would comment about her breasts and turn up while she was showering. She mentioned a foreign inmate at the youth section who allegedly had a soft spot for Zammit who used to tell the teen that he was divorced. However, the accused’s colleagues testified that Zammit was an “exemplary” man, assigned to carry out maintenance jobs at the youth section. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera noted inconsistencies in the versions given by the two victims and that the place where the alleged incidents took place was covered by security cameras, but the prosecution had failed to present any footage as evidence. One of those devices was mounted close to the washroom where the rape allegedly took place. Yet, the prosecution did not even seek to preserve that footage and produce it in evidence. She agreed with the conclusions of the first court that the prosecution did not manage to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the minors were not credible. The judge also observed how one of the minors, almost 16 years old, had threatened male officers that she would do to them like she had done to Zammit. This indicated that she knew that what she had alleged about Zammit was not true. She therefore confirmed the acquittal. Lawyers Franco Debono and Herman Mula were defence counsel.

Editorial: How heritage items go missing,Times of Malta,"Heritage Malta prides itself on being the “guardian of over 8,000 years of history that not only looks towards the heritage it curates to ensure its longevity but also towards the public and the future generations it wishes to inspire”. So, the public is justified in asking how heritage items can go missing. The news that two rare gold medals were recently stolen from the Maritime Museum and sustained “irreversible damage” when they were recovered shocked all those who have the preservation of Maltese heritage at heart. This theft was quickly followed by the announcement by Heritage Malta that three vases and a clock costing €13,000 had gone missing from the Grand Master’s Palace. These security failures are even more severe as the Maritime Museum reopened its doors in February after four years for a new year-long exhibition. Similarly, the Grand Master’s Palace was reopened to the public earlier this year, following five years of intense restoration. What focus was made by Heritage Malta in these restoration projects to ensure adequate security to protect the country’s heritage items? The irony is palpable: Heritage Malta responsible for ensuring that unique historical items are preserved for posterity, has become the victim of looters who overcame security hurdles with apparent ease. To answer the question as to why precious heritage items are missing from our museums and historical buildings, it is critical to understand the opaque and outdated management of our heritage buildings, which can lead to thefts. Museums and historical buildings often only display a small proportion of their collections. The remaining items are stored behind the scenes at the museum or other storage places. Staff work to catalogue, conserve and curate objects. These spaces can often serve as dynamic centres of research and learning. Occasionally, people donate legacies to our museums to ensure that their invaluable heritage items are catalogued and preserved for people to enjoy. These benefactors understandably trust Heritage Malta’s ability to do whatever it takes to ensure that rogues do not loot these heritage items. The government must ensure that Heritage Malta undertakes a professional and in-depth audit to detail the exact inventory of the items it safeguards. This must include taking measurements, weights, photographs, and assessments of the condition of every single heritage item. This audit conducted by experts must also make conservation recommendations and input the information into a database. Heritage items must then be given unique numbers and catalogued. Of course, physical security experts must also be roped in to ensure that the looting of historical items by staff or outsiders is made as difficult as possible. These meticulous operations demand considerable time and resources, luxuries that museum staff often lack. Prioritising public expenditure projects can frequently lead to budget cuts, impacting experienced heritage employee recruitment, retention and work continuity. Without explicit documentation and reengineered heritage management practices that include an effective security system, there can be no accountability for any given object. Internationally, high-profile thefts of historical items are not uncommon. The robbery of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911 by a handyman made sensational news. In 2004, the theft of The Scream, the iconic painting by Edvard Munch, stolen from the Munch Museum, was recovered two years later.  Heritage Malta is at a crossroads, with its relevance and reputation at stake. Now is the time for it to put its house in order to create an ethical future that safeguards our heritage items for future generations.

Search for cannabis leads to Żebbuġ fight,Jessica Arena,"A 23-year-old whose search for cannabis led him into a man's house in Żebbuġ ended up in court when that drug hunt soured into a knife fight. Polish national Igor Leweski was arraigned on Wednesday, accused of cultivating cannabis plants and simple possession of ecstasy and cannabis hemp.  Officers found the plants discarded in garbage bags at his house in St Paul’s Bay, which they searched after he got into an altercation in Żebbuġ. The sequence of events that led to that search was an eventful one. Police Inspector Francesca Calleja told the court that Leweski and two friends were driving from the airport at around 10.30 pm on the evening of March 30 when they headed in the direction of Żebbuġ.  In the village square, they came across a person smoking outside by himself. The group approached and asked whether he could supply them with cannabis. The man said that he could do so at his residence.  At the man’s home in Żebbuġ, Leweski and his friends found another man in a red T-shirt. At that point, the first man demanded money for the cannabis they wanted to buy. They handed over cash and the man went upstairs. The man in the red t-shirt then offered the group a smoke of an unknown substance from a plastic bottle, but they refused and asked for their money back.  At that point, one of the group realised that the first man was no longer in the room with them. A commotion broke out as Leweski’s group demanded he come back with their money.  Leweski took it upon himself to go upstairs and look for the man. He found him hiding in the dark, and as they argued he saw that he was holding a knife.  Downstairs, the man in the red t-shirt had also allegedly produced a knife and the arguing escalated into a full-blown fight.  As the altercation grew to attract more attention, police were called to the scene and Leweski and the others were arrested.  Police took Leweski to his home in St Paul’s Bay and searched the residence in his presence. They found nine cannabis plants and other items related to the cultivation of cannabis.  After being given time to consider, Leweski told the court that he pleaded guilty to all of the charges brought against him.  In advising the court on sentencing, the prosecution said that while the weight of the cannabis found in Leweski’s possession appeared to be hefty, police had found nothing to indicate that any of the material had been for anything other than personal use.  The accused had only just started to cultivate the plants and was apparently unsuccessful, as they had failed to produce any buds. So much so, that police had found the plants haphazardly discarded in garbage bags and it appeared as though Leweski had intended to throw them away.  As for the 220g of cannabis hemp found in the freezer, the police explained that this was very low in THC and was likely intended to be used to make cannabis-infused food.  “Overall there was nothing to indicate that he intended to supply this to anyone else and that’s why we have charged him with simple possession,” she said. Defence lawyer Joseph Calleja Parnis told the court that Leweski had been primarily interested in the culture of propagating cannabis and had been told that the strain he was trying to grow was difficult to get to flower and had a 50/50 chance of not producing anything at all. He therefore had decided to purchase nine plants, roughly double the legally permissible amount, to increase his chances of achieving the four flowering plants that would put him in the legal limit.  However, after none of his plans came to fruition he decided he had no more interest in cultivating the cannabis himself and had fully intended to discard the plants, which is why they were found in garbage bags.  Given that it was the accused’s first time facing trouble with the law, as well as the circumstances from which the case emerged, the court was asked to consider a lenient sentence.  On his own admission, Magistrate Leonard Caruana found Leweski guilty of the charges and sentenced him to one year of probation as well as a €900 fine.

Off-duty police officer intervenes to protect woman stabbed by stranger,Jessica Arena,"An off-duty police officer heading to work last month ended up arresting a knife-wielding man who attacked a woman outside a Birkirkara band club. The incident happened on March 20 and was recounted in court on Wednesday, when a 24-year-old Birkirkara man who cannot be named by court order was arraigned in front of Magistrate Leonard Caruana and accused of attempting to grievously injure a woman, causing her slight injuries as well as attacking a police officer.  Police Inspector Andrew Agius Bonello told the court that an off-duty policeman, who was in uniform as he was on his way to work, responded to cries for help coming from outside the St Anthony band club. There he found a woman and an aggressive man who tried to lunge at him with a blade. The officer avoided injury and the man was placed under arrest. Initial investigations indicated that the woman standing on the club’s parapet when she was approached by the accused. She said that she did not know him and felt threatened by his presence.  This is when she noticed a knife in his hands and tried to run away from him. The accused, police said, gave chase and tried to stab her in the stomach.  The blade snapped upon impact with the woman’s body and did not result in a stab wound, however, the accused allegedly picked up the felled blade and slashed at the woman, injuring her arms and neck.  These were later certified as slight injuries by a medical expert.  The court heard that the accused was placed at Mount Carmel Hospital through an involuntary hold.  He is pleading not guilty to the charges.  Defence lawyer Malcolm Mifsud said that, notwithstanding the serious nature of the charges, the accused has a history of mental health issues and would be better served following a treatment order at the mental health hospital rather than at the Corradino Correctional Facility.  The lawyer requested bail for his client, saying he intended to follow a 10-week treatment order at Mount Carmel and would then be released to his parents who will continue to supervise him. The defence also asked the court to ban the publication of the accused’s name given the nature of his mental health difficulties. The man holds a steady job as a customer service representative in the gaming industry and considering the nature of his mental struggles, the publication of his name may aggravate his condition.  The prosecution objected to the request for bail, arguing that while the accused did not know the victim in the incident, the altercation happened in the neighbourhood where it is common for several of the witnesses to congregate. Given the proximity to the accused’s home, it posed a fear that he could tamper with evidence.  Despite his clean criminal record, the prosecution also said that it was not reassured that the accused’s mental state would remain stable and that another incident would not occur.  A treatment order, they added could also be followed at the forensic unit at Mount Carmel Hospital while the accused remained in preventative custody.  After hearing submissions, Magistrate Caruana denied the bail application but ordered that the man be sent to Mount Carmel Hospital where he could also receive treatment.  The order for the ban on the publication of the accused’s name was also accepted.  Lawyer Manuel Grech from the office of the Attorney General prosecuted.  Lawyer Gianluca Cappitta also appeared for the accused. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Handwriting expert found 'discrepancies' in cheques handed to Fr Luke Seguna,Edwina Brincat,"A handwriting expert has testified that ""discrepancies"" were found in cheques given to former Marsaxlokk parish priest Luke Seguna.  The writing of whoever signed those cheques did not match the issuer's but neither did they match Seguna's. The case against Seguna, who is accused of misappropriating some €500,000 from 150 parishioners over a ten-year span continued on Tuesday.  The priest has pleaded not guilty.  Last November calligraphy expert Joseph Mallia was tasked with examining several APS Bank cheques, comparing the writing on those cheques with the handwriting of the issuer, Louis Caruana, as well as that of the accused. Caruana was a dementia patient who has since died. On Tuesday the expert reported on his findings, explaining that the writing on some of the cheques matched Seguna’s handwriting.  However, some discrepancies were noted in the writing of those signatures.  Characteristic points in the samples taken from Caruana and Seguna, which helped the expert determine whether there was a match, were not found on the cheque signatures. Asked to clarify, the expert said that those signatures did not match the flow of writing of whoever signed off on the cheque. The rest of the writing, for instance, “Pay so and so….”, matched Seguna’s handwriting but the signature was dubious.  “There were no complete characteristic points matching Seguna’s,” the expert explained.  “So from your observation, the likelihood is that the signatures were not compatible with the accused’s handwriting,” defence lawyer Jose’ Herrera asked.  “Yes,” replied Mallia. “So probably he [the accused] did not write them,” added the lawyer.  But the expert clarified that “to be fair, whoever copies someone’s handwriting would try to copy that script as much as possible….Based on [the documents] I saw, there were no characteristic points compatible with Seguna’s.” An assistant court registrar informed presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello that the magisterial inquiry into the priest’s missing laptop was still pending.  Three Marsaxlokk parishioners also testified.  One was a catechist at the parish who confirmed that she regularly donated money during mass and also contributed to the ‘arbural’ system for two or three years, paying a €10 monthly contribution or one annual lump sum.  She would hand her donations to Seguna, issuing cheques to “Marsaxlokk parish” for the needs of the church.  Although she could not remember if she had been given receipts for her donations, she could see that works on the parish church, such as the restoration of the church organ and paintings, were done.  Her name was also put down on the church records confirming her donations. When asked by defence lawyer Matthew Xuereb, she confirmed that she was “satisfied” that the projected works were done. Another parishioner who turned to Seguna when going through a rough patch said that he looked upon the former parish priest as “his friend.” The man had given Seguna a €150 cheque as “something back for his time.”  The last witness was involved in Marsaxlokk’s fireworks organization. They had organized some “three or four” fundraising events, such as barbecues, together with Seguna.  When COVID-19 broke out, it put an end to those events.  Once expenses were deducted, the proceeds were shared between the organization and the parish, the witness said, explaining that Seguna would pay for insurance to cover fireworks displays and other feast activities.  Profits from those social events ranged between €300 and €700, while the insurance cost some €3,000.  Permits were issued regularly and Seguna always paid for the insurance.  The case continues.  AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Andrea Zammit prosecuted.  Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera are defence counsel.

Parents of US school shooter sentenced to 10-15 years in prison ,AFP,"The parents of a teenager who carried out a deadly school shooting in the US state of Michigan were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison on Tuesday in an unprecedented and closely watched case. Jennifer Crumbley, 46, and her husband James, 47, were the first parents of a school shooter convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the United States for the actions of their child. Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews sentenced them to 10 and 15 years in prison each with credit for the 28 months they had already spent behind bars. Their son Ethan, who is now 17, is serving a life sentence for the November 30, 2021, shooting which left four students dead and seven other people injured at Oxford High School, 70 kilometres north of Detroit. ""Parents are not expected to be psychic,"" Matthews said at an emotional sentencing hearing in Pontiac, Michigan, attended by parents of the victims. ""But these convictions are not about poor parenting,"" Matthews said. ""These convictions confirm repeated acts, or lack of acts, that could have halted an oncoming runaway train."" Addressing the court before sentencing, Craig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, 17, one of the slain students, told the Crumbleys ""The blood of our children is on your hands."" Steve St. Juliana, the father of another victim, Hana St. Juliana, who was 14, said her murder ""has destroyed a large portion of my soul."" ""I am forever denied the chance to hold her or her future children in my arms,"" he said. During separate trials, the Crumbleys were accused of ignoring warnings that their son had mental health struggles. Jennifer Crumbley testified during her trial that her husband bought their son the 9mm SIG Sauer handgun he used in the attack just days earlier as an early Christmas present. She took the boy to a shooting range the day after the purchase. The Crumbleys were summoned to the school on the day of the shooting itself after a teacher became alarmed by a violent drawing she found on Ethan's desk. They were shown the drawing and advised they needed to get the boy into counselling. The parents allegedly resisted taking their son home and he returned to class. He later entered a bathroom, emerged with the gun which had been concealed in his backpack and fired more than 30 shots. Amid a huge number of deadly firearms incidents involving young people in the United States, pressure has been mounting to punish parents who make it possible for their children to get weapons. The father of an Illinois man accused of killing seven people in July 2022 pleaded guilty in November to misdemeanour charges of ""reckless conduct"" for helping his son obtain the assault rifle used in the mass shooting. A Virginia woman whose six-year-old son shot and severely wounded his teacher was recently sentenced to two years in prison for felony child neglect. She later received an additional 21 months in prison after pleading guilty to illegally obtaining the firearm. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Puppies found abandoned in box, rescuers say it has become 'daily' occurrence",Daniel Ellul,"Two puppies were found abandoned near Delimara on Saturday afternoon, in what animal welfare officers warn is becoming an all too common occurrence.  ""It's become an almost daily occurrence to find abandoned dogs or cats. The problem is always growing,"" Stephen Carabott, an animal welfare officer told Times of Malta.  Carabott and his colleague Robert Farrugia found the two puppies in a cardboard box in the area of St Paul's Battery, next to Xrobb l-Għaġin.  ""We received a call from three youths hiking at around noon; we went on site and found these two puppies; it's clear this is a case of abandonment,"" Carabott said.   ""We found the dogs crying and barking, but seemed to be in a good condition,"" Carabott said.  The two officers transported the puppies to a vet in Naxxar, where they were being held under observation.  In the back of the animal welfare car, the two puppies seemed dejected and scared.  Carabott said Animal Welfare and the police were investigating the case and from the facts so far, the owner could be identified. The puppies will be up for adoption once the clinic clears them, Carabott said. Should nobody come forward, they will be kept at Animal Welfare or fostered.  Contacted for comment, animal rights parliamentary secretary Alicia Bugeja Said said whoever is caught in ""grave cases such as this should be given the maximum penalty possible to avoid a repetition of such acts"".  Any person found guilty of breaching animal welfare laws for the first time can face a maximum fine of €65,000, and/or a maximum prison sentence of three years.  Repeat offenders face a maximum fine of €80,000 and/or a three-year prison sentence.  Bugeja Said said anyone who spots or suspects animal abuse or abandonment should contact the hotline 1717. Anyone who wants to adopt can contact Animal Welfare via adoptapet.gov.mt. ""Those adopting must be responsible and know what they are getting themselves into. They (pets) are members of the family and are not to be used and abandoned when you get fed up,"" she said.  Bugeja Said said there is an ongoing process to regulate the sector with new laws to protect animals.  Animal welfare organisations have had a busy week. On Wednesday, 27 dogs were rescued after they were found in appalling conditions.  An inseparable rabbit and fox terrier were also rescued after being found abandoned, curled together in a valley on the Chadwick lakes trail.

Trio charged with beating shop attendant after stealing from Sliema shop,Edwina Brincat,"Two women and a man have been charged with stealing from a Sliema shop and then beating the shop attendant who chased them.  Valentina Schembri, 25, Leanne Chalbi, 35 and Ans Ghodban, 28, all living at Sliema within walking distance from where the incident took place, were charged with the violent theft which allegedly occurred on Wednesday afternoon.  Around an hour later, at around 3:30pm, the shop attendant called the police and asked for help.  When officers arrived on site, the woman explained how two female customers had entered the shop, browsing the shelves and then asking about some items on display. The attendant moved away from the cash point. When she returned, she found the cash drawer open. Some €150 to €170 were missing. She immediately rushed outside and chased after the women, who were walking away with a man, and took photos of the three suspects using her mobile phone.  That was when they turned aggressive and started hitting her.  The alleged victim later showed those photos to the police, who immediately headed out to monitor the area. Officers later spotted the three suspects at a bus stop. They matched the description and photos supplied by the shop attendant.  When police searched them, they found some of the allegedly stolen items which included a reddish handbag, various rings, a keychain and two cigarette lighters bearing the Maltese emblem.  Police also found €35 in Ghodban’s possession, said prosecuting Inspector Eman Hayman when outlining the events leading up to the arrest. On Friday, all three were charged with aggravated theft, with Ghodban charged as an accomplice in the violent aggression against the shop attendant.  Schembri was also separately charged with attacking and violently resisting two police officers.  Ghodban was charged with breaching bail conditions and all three were charged with relapsing. All pleaded not guilty.  Their lawyers sought to throw cold water upon the prosecution’s case, arguing that evidence was rather sparse. Ghodban had not stolen anything, his lawyers argued, and the prosecution was just assuming that he had served as a lookout for the two women. Moreover, the €35 in cash found in his possession was inconclusive evidence. “Who would not have €35 in his possession?!”remarked defence lawyer Franco Debono, highlighting further that the amount allegedly stolen did not exceed €200. Lawyer Ishmael Psaila pointed out that Ghodban had not only remained outside but was also not masked nor armed.  Lawyer Jose’ Herrera argued that it the case was one of purely “numerical violence” and was only classified as aggravated because more than two suspects were involved.  Lawyer Adriano Spiteri argued that the amount allegedly stolen was minimal and all evidence was preserved.  Yet AG lawyer Giuliana Magro rebutted that it took three persons to carry out such a “petty theft” and that the three had allegedly beaten the shop attendant.  The circumstances of the case and their criminal record made it likely that the accused would not abide by bail conditions, the prosecutor argued.  After hearing submissions by all parties the court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, turned down the request for bail. The court noted that the accused had criminal records and that their the alleged victim was still to testify.  AG lawyer Giuliana Magro Conti and Inspector Eman Hayman prosecuted.Lawyer Jose’ Herrera was counsel to Schembri.Lawyer Adriano Spiteri was legal aid counsel to Chalbi.Lawyers Franco Debono and Ishmael Psaila were counsel to Ghodban.

"Vases, clock worth €13,000 go missing from Valletta Grand Master's Palace",Times of Malta,"Three vases and a clock costing €13,000 have gone missing from the Grand Master's Palace, Heritage Malta said on Friday. In a statement, the national agency said the items went missing from halls within the palace. Their disappearance was flagged by Heritage Malta officials. The agency filed a report about the missing items with the police, which in turn launched an investigation. The police and Heritage Malta officials are reviewing footage caught by the CCTV system at the palace.  The Valletta palace was reopened to the public earlier this year following five years of intense restoration that has more than doubled its accessibility to visitors.   The disappearance of the vases and the clock comes less than a month since two gold medals valued at €400,000 were stolen from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa. The medals were traced inside the residence of a man who was arraigned over their theft and granted bail. Justin Mallia, 25, from Cospicua allegedly posed as an official from the education department, visiting the museum to deliver documents, when he stole the gold medals to settle debts. The museum has since beefed up security and launched an internal probe.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Police recount steps by suspects before and after Għargħur hold-up,Edwina Brincat,"Two men who allegedly made off with cash in an armed robbery at a Għargħur office last month, were remanded in custody upon arraignment on Wednesday. Marin Minev, 33 unemployed, and Miroslav Mihalev, a 34-year-old mechanic, both Bulgarian nationals, pleaded not guilty to the violent theft which took place on March 22 at an office in Triq Stiefnu Zerafa. Prosecuting Inspector Christina Delia told the court that at about 10am on the day of the crime, two men wearing crash helmets barged into the premises, ordered a person who was present to hand over the money and made off with an indeterminate amount of cash. Working on CCTV footage from the site of the robbery and information gathered from the alleged victims as well as other witnesses who were in the vicinity when the incident took place, investigators followed the tracks of a particular vehicle. They were told that right after the holdup, a revving sound was heard and a motorbike with two riders was seen driving off. Through surveillance cameras, police followed that vehicle all the way to Qormi, right up to Triq it-Tensila where Mihalev lived. Footage recorded prior to the robbery showed the suspects driving along Naxxar Road and on to Gharghur. They parked the bike in a narrow road between two showrooms in Mosta, then crossed the street and entered Pama Supermarket where the security officer at the door ordered one of the men to pull down his hoodie. The man was identified as Minev who had a distinctive tattoo. His companion wore no helmet and no hoodie. He was easily identified as Mihalev who had been arrested over a separate incident some months previously. The men bought a can of spray paint and headed back to the motorbike. Mihalev sprayed his helmet and bike with black spray, covering stickers and other distinctive markings. That evidence triggered arrest warrants against the two suspects who were taken into custody early on Tuesday morning when police called at their homes. On Wednesday the two men were escorted to court, jointly facing charges of aggravated theft, being in possession of a weapon at the time of the holdup and wilfully damaging third party property. Minev was separately charged with relapsing. Mihalev was separately charged with committing the offences during the operative period of a suspended sentence handed down last December. Assisted by a Bulgarian interpreter, both pleaded not guilty. Their lawyers requested bail. Lawyer Franco Debono asked whether a magisterial inquiry had been called. The prosecution confirmed that an inquiry was started right after the robbery and investigations were still ongoing. Asked whether the alleged victims had already testified before the inquiring magistrate, the prosecution could not confirm that. The request for bail was objected to because proceedings are still at a very early stage and investigations are ongoing, even because a third party was mentioned by the suspects during interrogation. The wife and partner of the co-accused were asked to testify, both confirming that if granted bail each accused would live at the family home. After hearing their brief testimonies and submissions by the parties, Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace refused bail and remanded both men in custody. AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici and Inspectors Christine Delia and Joseph Mallia prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit were counsel to Minev. Lawyer Adriano Spiteri was legal aid counsel to Mihalev. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Man used toy gun in Msida betting shop hold-up, court told",Jessica Arena,"A man used a toy gun for a hold-up at an Msida betting shop, before making off with an undisclosed amount in cash, a court heard on Tuesday.  Joseph Pisani, 50, from Msida, was arraigned before Magistrate Joseph Gatt and accused of stealing the cash from the betting shop at Msida Seafront on the morning of March 22.  He was also charged with holding the shop employee against her will, causing her to fear violence, and being in possession of an imitation firearm.  He pleaded not guilty.  Police Inspector Stephen Gulia told the court that police homed in on the accused thanks to CCTV footage, which showed Pisani running away from the shop towards a garden close to the Msida police station. There the accused was seen changing into new clothes and walking away from the garden to his home in Rue D’Argens, also in Msida. Police went to his home and arrested him. They subsequently established that the “firearm” that had been brandished during the hold-up was simply a toy gun.  Pisani pleaded not guilty to the charges.  In view of the fact that he is currently unemployed, his lawyer said a request for bail would not be made at this time.  Magistrate Gatt issued a protection order in favour of the betting shop and its employees and told Pisani to take heed because, even though he was going back to jail for the time being, the protection order would still be in place if he was released from custody at a future date.  “I have no intention of hurting anybody,” Pisani told the court.  “Good, now take that intention and make sure you act on it,” the Magistrate replied.  Police inspectors Lydon Zammit and Stephen Gulia as well as AG lawyer Shelby Aquilina prosecuted.  Lawyer Adriano Spiteri appeared as legal aid for the accused.

Mexican police arrest three after girl's murder sparks lynching,AFP,"Mexican authorities have arrested three suspects in the murder of an eight-year-old girl, after an outraged mob in the tourist town of Taxco lynched a woman accused in the crime. A man and a minor were arrested on Saturday ""for the crime of femicide"", Guerrero state prosecutors said in a press statement, along with another man the day before on similar charges. The girl's family had received anonymous telephone calls demanding a ransom after she disappeared on Wednesday, Mexican media reported, quoting a relative. Residents on Thursday blocked one of the main streets of Taxco, which has been plagued by organised crime, after the child's body was found on a highway. Security camera footage had circulated earlier showing suspects allegedly putting a black bag in the trunk of a car, prompting suspicions that it contained the girl's body. A mob gathered outside a house where a woman and two men were located, demanding justice. They dragged out the trio, doused them in gasoline, and beat them with sticks. The woman died and the two men were hospitalized. The prosecutor's office did not clarify whether the men attacked by the angry mob were among those arrested. ""My solidarity is with the family (of the minor), the future is not understood without justice,"" the governor of Guerrero, Evelyn Salgado, said Friday on X, formerly Twitter.  Worsening crime in Taxco led the United States in January to ban its government employees from visiting the city, located about 170 kilometres from Mexico City. Kidnappings and murders are daily occurrences in Mexico, although adult men are the most common victims, making the young girl's death particularly shocking. There are regular lynchings of alleged criminals, which experts link to the widespread perception of impunity in the crime-wracked country. A report by researchers at the Autonomous University of Mexico found that 1,423 lynchings were recorded between 2016 and 2022.

Maritime Museum beefs up security after theft of medals ,Matthew Xuereb,"The Malta Maritime Museum has beefed up security and launched an internal probe following the theft of two gold medals which sustained irreversible damage until they were recovered. The measures came after Justin Mallia, 25, from Cospicua allegedly posed as an official from the education department, visiting the museum to deliver documents, when he allegedly stole the gold medals to settle debts. He was arrested before he had time to sell the items worth €400,000 but the medals were placed inside a pouch and were subsequently damaged. A spokesperson for the culture ministry told Times of Malta that, in parallel with the magisterial inquiry requested by the police, Heritage Malta had appointed an internal board to investigate everything that happened on the day in question. She said that, until the board presents its report with its recommendations on how security can be improved, the culture agency took “all the necessary measures to further strengthen the museum’s security system”. She added that it was thanks to the museum’s current system that the alleged perpetrator was apprehended by the police. This was confirmed in court during the last sitting when police inspector Paul Camilleri explained how Mallia, who is known to the police, was identified on CCTV footage provided by the museum. Mallia is denying aggravated theft, being in possession of the two illegally acquired medals belonging to the government of Malta and defrauding the Maritime Museum. It emerged that Mallia was given bail just days before being charged with stealing the medals from the Vittoriosa museum. He also stands charged with breaching three bail decrees, the latest one given on March 6.  According to Heritage Malta, the medals were awarded between 1800 and 1801 to leaders and distinguished members of the National Congress battalions who fought to free Malta from the French. They are very rare and, therefore, valuable, particularly because of their historical significance to Malta.Initially Mallia registered an admission when he appeared in court, explaining that he had stolen the medals to settle a pending debt he incurred to pay for bail in a separate case. He then retracted his admission.  The court heard so far how he was granted access while an event for schoolchildren was taking place. The inspector said the medals sustained damage inside the pouch as they were brushing against other items. The medals were inside a showcase that was forced open. The museum only reopened its doors last month after four years for a new year-long exhibition being held in newly restored sections of the museum. Built by the British in 1842 on the ruins of a Knight-era arsenal, the building mainly served as a bakery for the Mediterranean Fleet. It was converted into a museum in 1992.

Dutch hostage drama ends without bloodshed,AFP,"Updated 1.30pm            A hostage drama in the Netherlands that lasted several hours on Saturday ended without bloodshed as all hostages were freed and police took the suspect into custody. Authorities have said there was no reason to suspect a ""terrorist motive"" for the ordeal, which took place at a night spot popular with young people in the town of Ede. ""The last hostage has just been released. One person has been arrested. We cannot share more information at this time,"" announced police on X, formerly Twitter. Several local media reported that a ""confused"" man had burst into the cafe in the early hours of Saturday morning and made threats, holding four people hostage. The incident sparked a major deployment including riot police and explosives experts. Police cleared the centre of the town and evacuated the residents of some 150 buildings near the cafe. An initial group of three people were released, with pictures from public broadcaster NOS showing them exiting the building with their hands in the air. The fourth hostage was freed shortly afterwards, with the suspected hostage-taker then arrested. NOS images showed a man kneeling on the ground with his hands behind his back, as officers restrained him with handcuffs. ""A terrible situation for all these people. My concern and thoughts go out to them and their loved ones. I hope that the situation is now resolved quickly and safely,"" said Ede mayor Rene Verhulst. Last year, a 27-year-old man armed with two guns held several people hostage at an Apple store in Amsterdam, sparking a tense five-hour ordeal. That stand-off ended when the suspect was hit by a police car as he chased his last hostage who made a desperate break for freedom and ran out of the store. He later died in hospital from his injuries. The Netherlands has seen a series of terror attacks and plots but not on the scale of other European countries, such as France or Britain. In 2019, the country was stunned by a shooting spree on a tram in the city of Utrecht that claimed four lives. In the most serious incident involving a terror attack, outspoken Dutch anti-Islam film director Theo van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in 2004 in Amsterdam by a man with ties to a Dutch Islamist terror network.

"Bird smuggling ring: police arrest two, seize 2,500 stuffed birds",Times of Malta,"Two men believed to form part of a massive bird smuggling ring are under arrest after police seized around 2,500 stuffed birds from their homes. The two suspects are a 42-year-old Żurrieq man and a 57-year-old Gudja man, the police said in a statement on Saturday. Investigators suspect them of being part of a wider organised crime ring through which protected birds are smuggled into Malta and then stuffed. Officers seized around 2,500 stuffed birds from the two men’s homes, along with seven shotguns. When officers searched the Żurrieq man’s home, they also found over 100 protected birds in a freezer, as well as the carcass of a protected African Genet. Inside the Gudja man’s home, they also found 40 birds in a freezer. A police investigation into the criminal ring is under way. It is the largest such haul in years. In 2019, the police had discovered 700 dead birds in what they said was a similar ring focused on stuffing and selling protected birds. At the time, investigators had told Times of Malta that the seizure was most likely “the tip of the iceberg.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Italian artist injured in ‘blasphemy’ protest in Carpi church,AFP,"An Italian artist accused of blasphemy for an “obscene” painting of Jesus was injured in a scuffle Thursday with a protester vandalising his exhibition in a Catholic church, police said. The diocese of Carpi in northern Italy offered its full support for artist Andrea Saltini after what it condemned as an “unprecedented act of violence” ahead of the Christian holiday of Easter. Saltini’s exhibition Gratia Plena – meaning “full of grace” in Latin, a line from a Catholic prayer – opened at the diocesan museum at the church of Saint Ignatius on March 2. But the paintings drew protests and 30,000 people signed a petition accusing him of blasphemy, saying one picture showed Jesus “engaged in an obscene sexual act”. On Thursday morning, a masked man carrying black spray paint and a knife entered the exhibition aiming to damage the artworks, a local police spokesman told AFP. The artist confronted the vandal as he sought to cut one of the paintings, and was “lightly injured”. He later sought hospital treatment. The attacker got away, but police believe the injury was inflicted accidentally, with the perpetrator perhaps not even realising who Saltini was. The diocese thanked police for their “timely intervention” and offered its full cooperation with any investigation. The diocese had previously rejected accusations of blasphemy, hailing Saltini’s works as a rare example of “true contemporary art with a religious subject”. The paintings are inspired by Christian subjects, including the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and the crucifixion of St Peter. But the petition declared “No to blasphemy disguised as art” and urged the withdrawal of the “profoundly disrespectful” works, alongside a blurred picture of a painting showing a man bending over the lower half of a naked Jesus. The organisers of the petition, anti-abortion group Pro Vita, offered its “full solidarity” with Saltini after what it called a “crazy and unjustifiable attack”. Concerns about his work “cannot in any way justify any type of personal violence”, Pro Vita President Antonio Brandi said in a statement.

Fallen crypto tycoon Bankman-Fried gets 25-year sentence,AFP,"Disgraced cryptocurrency wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in jail on Thursday - a stunning descent for a figure who seemed poised to lead an emerging sector less than two years ago.  US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said the defendant, who became known by his initials ""SBF,"" had shown no ""real remorse,"" even in his final pre-sentencing remarks in which the former billionaire rued ""a series of bad decisions"" but did not acknowledge knowingly violating financial laws. Bankman-Fried said ""mistakes were made, but never a word of remorse for the commission of a terrible crime,"" said Kaplan, who characterized the violations as ""brazen"" and called out the defendant for his ""exceptional flexibility"" towards the truth. Kaplan set a sentence of 25 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. The defendant also was ordered to pay $11 billion, an amount reflective of what Bankman-Fried effectively stole from other parties, according to Kaplan's calculations. Thursday's sentencing followed the November 2023 conviction by a federal jury in New York of Bankman-Fried, who once made the cover of financial magazines and financed splashy Super Bowl television ads in 2022. Although lower than the 40-50 years sought by the government, the Justice Department praised the sentence. ""Today's sentence... is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe,"" said US federal prosecutor Damian Williams. Bankman-Fried's parents, Stanford law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, said in a statement: ""We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son."" Bankman-Fried had soared to the top of the crypto world, becoming a billionaire before age 30 and turning FTX, a small start-up he cofounded in 2019, into the world's second-largest exchange platform. But in November 2022, Bankman-Fried's breakneck rise came crashing down, with a deluge of customer withdrawals following revelations that billions of dollars had been illegally moved from FTX to Bankman-Fried's personal hedge fund, Alameda Research. In remarks to the court, defense attorney Marc Mukasey characterized Bankman-Fried as a well-intended, ""awkward math nerd,"" rather than a cold-hearted figure like notorious Ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff. ""It's obviously a serious offense, but Sam was not a financial serial killer who set out to hurt people,"" Mukasey said. During the hearing, Bankman-Fried expressed regret about the firm's demise, which also affected many colleagues. They ""built something beautiful,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""And I threw it all away. It haunts me every day. I made a series of bad decisions."" Bankman-Fried said he was anguished that FTX victims had not been compensated - something he said ""begs a question of why they haven't been paid back."" But federal prosecutor Nicolas Roos, speaking after Bankman-Fried, said the defendant continued to play down his crimes, noting the impact was ""not a bloodless financial loss on paper."" Roos described ""immediate"" financial harm to FTX victims, including one investor in Portugal whose daughter was born the day before FTX imploded and a married couple of retirees who were forced to go back to work. Kaplan agreed with key arguments from the government. The judge had begun the hearing by rejecting the defense's efforts to persuade the court to consider billions of dollars worth of recoveries through the FTX bankruptcy as lowering the size of the fraud. Kaplan called out Bankman-Fried for witness tampering and enumerated at least three specific instances where he had given false testimony. ""When he wasn't outright lying, he was often evasive, hair-splitting, dodging questions,"" Kaplan said of Bankman-Fried's testimony. The Justice Department had developed its sentence recommendation in part to account for the risk that Bankman-Fried could engage in further fraud if released too quickly. While stopping short of the government's full sentence, Kaplan agreed that a free Bankman-Fried would pose a risk. Bankman-Fried could say ""that mistakes were made. Other people were to blame. The bankruptcy people screwed up,"" Kaplan said. ""It doesn't take too much imagination to see the outline"" of another narrative. ""But there is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad, and it's not a trivial risk,"" said Kaplan, calling a lengthy sentence necessary to ""disable"" Bankman-Fried.

"Lecturer left 'shaking, dripping blood' after student assault, supporters hear",Jessica Arena,"A crowd of MCAST educators rallied on Wednesday in support of a lecturer who was assaulted by a student last week. The Malta Union of Teachers organised the protest to condemn the aggression and raise awareness about the increasingly difficult conditions educators face.  Education Minister Clifton Grima as well as MCAST management officials also attended the protest at the MCAST Campus in Paola.  While not physically present, the lecturer in a statement circulated by the MUT said that he was left “shaking” and with “blood dripping down (his) face” after the incident.  The lecturer, identified only as Mr KC, said that he was never assaulted in such a manner in his 20-year career.  He said it  happened in the context of the student having in the previous weeks refused to participate or do class work, further compounded by his classmates refusing to do group assignments with him.  “Over the past four weeks, the class had to prepare and submit a class assignment as per procedure. Student N did not even print the front sheet which had been provided months before the assignment. He attended class and did not want to work,” the lecturer said.  On the day of the incident, the lecturer said he had asked the student where his work was. Despite this assignment being class-based and therefore handwritten, the lecturer claimed the student tried to be funny by saying that it was on his laptop.  “When I asked where the front sheet was, he said that he left it at home. I reminded him that this was the last day to finish off the work. Instead of apologising, he started waving his hands, accusing him (the lecturer) of confusion and changing the dates, saying 'għax int ilek tħawwad id-dati... xbajt tħawwad',” the lecturer said. This exchange, he continued, escalated into searing and offensive language by the student and when the lecturer asked him to leave he remained seated. That was when the “aggressive action” against him occurred.  “I left class shaking and with blood dripping from my face and was assisted by the management. I attended a clinic for treatment and have a scheduled appointment at Mater Dei for scans to determine if there are hidden fractures.”    MUT president Marco Bonnici addressed criticism made at the fact that the lecturer had slammed his hands on the student’s desk before the attack.  “When the footage (of the assault) was doing the rounds some were scandalised and said that it was unacceptable that a lecturer slammed the table,” Bonnici said. “If we all together, educators or otherwise slammed our hands when it was necessary, then incidents like these could have been avoided,” he said. We should all be reacting angrily, he said, to situations where families have been “abdicating from the responsibility of raising their children” and youths had easy access to substances, legal or otherwise, alcohol, sex and gambling. Bonnici said educators should feel angry at youths who had no desire to work but wanted to find foreigners to exploit; when success was determined by who one knew and not what one knew, and when bullies were put on a pedestal and idolised. Unprecedented levels of bullying, teens isolating themselves online as well as self-harm were also worth ‘slamming’ over Bonnici added. “But instead of reacting we are choosing to close our eyes to these realities,” he said. “We educators cannot close our eyes. If everyone is ready to abdicate responsibility to raise our children and youths, we are not ready to do so.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Chilean accused of defrauding businessman was 'prohibited migrant', court hears",Edwina Brincat,"A businessman who successfully fought off extradition to Chile six years ago and is now facing fraud charges before the Maltese courts, was a “prohibited migrant” whose residence card was revoked “20 minutes” after it was issued in 2016. Details about the alleged fraud as well as the entrepreneur’s current status in Malta emerged at the first hearing of the compilation of evidence against Alberto Samuel Chang Rajii, a 50-year-old Peruvian-born and Chilean national, who on Tuesday reiterated his not guilty plea when fresh accusations were added to his charge sheet. In 2017, Chang Rajii had challenged an extradition request by Chilean authorities who wanted to prosecute him over a suspected $80 million fraudulent Ponzi scheme which left investors high and dry. The extradition request was turned down by the court and that decision was confirmed on appeal in 2018. Six years later, a transaction alert from a local hostel to the unsuspecting holder of a Master Card account, triggered a police report which led to Chang Rajii’s arrest. When the case kicked off on Tuesday, Rajii’s allegedly latest victim took the witness stand. The man, a local businessman now a consultant for a leisure company, recalled how earlier in March he was in the final stages of a meeting when he received an alert from the St Julian’s boutique hostel about the €540 payment through his credit card. Since he had “absolutely not” authorised that transaction, the cardholder waited until the meeting was over and then called the hostel to inquire further. The receptionist refused to divulge information but called the manager who simply confirmed the transaction but declined further details, citing data protection restrictions. She suggested that he should inform the police rather than turn up uselessly at the hostel. Within minutes he turned up at the St Julian’s police station where he filed a report about the suspected fraud and then accompanied the officers to the hostel, waiting outside while they went inside to follow up the matter. Later, he saw Chang Rajii being escorted out by the policemen. The alleged victim immediately recognised the suspect as his former tenant. Back in 2015, Chang Rajii had travelled to Malta to acquire a Maltese passport through the Citizenship By Investment Scheme. He had been shown the property. “He liked it, he wanted it,” said the witness who at the time had negotiated the six-year lease through Henley and Partners. He last spoke to Chang Rajii in 2022. When the Chilean multimillionaire first came to Malta, his Maltese landlord would occasionally hand over his own bank card to Chang Rajii to enable him to effect certain minor purchases, such as Netflix. “I would give him my card, stay with him and take it back,” explained the witness. “He was renting my house….he was very charming….very intelligent. He knows a lot, about a lot of things,” went on the alleged victim, describing his reaction when finding out that he had been swindled. “I was disbelieving… to me it was a shock.” When the transaction alert came through on March 13, he initially hesitated about reporting the matter to the police. But when he checked his account, he discovered a series of transactions which started off with petty amounts, between €13 and €20, but which ballooned to €400 or €500 some six or seven months down the line. Those “cleverly staggered amounts” when added up by the account holder totaled some €10,600. With his mind made up, the alleged victim headed to the police. That same day, he handed over his credit card to the investigators and the card was frozen. Shown the document in court on Tuesday, the witness confirmed that it was the same card he had been using for years. Cross examined by defence lawyer Ilona Schembri, the witness confirmed that he had never changed his credit card. Towards the end of last year, he had received a similar alert from the bank but since at the time he was abroad, he had not followed it up. When the next alert arrived from the boutique hostel, he acted upon it. Questioned why he had not called the bank to immediately block his card, the witness said that he opted to inform the police, pointing out that it only took minutes to go from work to the police station and on to the hostel. When the defence pointed out a two-hour lapse between the transaction and the report, during which further fraud might have been perpetrated, the witness remarked “could be”. Asked why he did not take action when €400 and over transactions were registered in one day, the witness explained that his secretary would normally handle the paperwork. He had previously authorised Chang Rajii to use his card for specific transactions. “During 2023 and 2024 did you authorise anyone [to use the card],” asked AG lawyer Claire Sammut. “Absolutely not,” came the firm reply. A representative from Identità testified that Chang Rajii had only filed one application for a temporary residence permit back in 2015 and his biometric details were taken that same day. He was described as “self-sufficient” and the permit meant that he could not work in Malta. The card was issued on April 21, 2016 but was revoked “20 minutes later” as per emails received by the agency. Asked for further details about those emails and Chang Rajii’s current status, the witness said she “did not have that information”. Inspector Karl Roberts from the Immigration Department confirmed that Chang Rajii had only submitted one application for residence and that was revoked. That meant that in terms of immigration laws, he was “a prohibited migrant” who could be subject to a return order by the Principal Immigration Officer. Two officers from the St Julian’s police station who accompanied the victim to the hostel also testified on Tuesday. While the alleged victim waited outside, they had spoken to the hostel manager who confirmed that the payment had been effected some 45 minutes earlier by a client who had been staying at the hostel for a year or so. The manager accompanied them to the suspect’s room and on the way they met Chang Rajii. When they ordered him to show them his mobile phone, the man did so. There they found his virtual credit card bearing the identical number as the alleged victim’s card but under a different name. Prosecuting Inspector Daryl Farr also testified that when investigating this recent report, he came across two other reports on the police system relating to the same suspect. One was filed in 2022 and another in 2023. The alleged victim in the 2023 report was abroad but had confirmed his interest in the criminal case when speaking to the inspector via video call. That was why additional charges were pressed against Chang Rajii on Tuesday. The court, presided over by magistrate Gabriella Vella, decreed that there were sufficient reasons for the accused to face trial on indictment before the competent court. The case continues. AG lawyer Claire Sammut prosecuted together with inspectors Daryl Farr and Nico Zarb. Lawyer Ilona Schembri was legal aid counsel. Lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell appeared parte civile.

Marsaxlokk man charged with seriously injuring wife on 24th wedding anniversary,Claudia Calleja,"A man appeared in court on his 24th wedding anniversary -  charged with seriously injuring his wife and causing her to fear him following an argument in their Marsaxlokk home. Police inspector Omar Zammit told Magistrate Marsanne Farrugia how, on March 23, the wife of the accused went to the police’s domestic violence unit and reported that she suffered an injury during an argument with her husband. It turned out that she had a cut on her nose that was certified as serious.  The accused, 45 from Marsaxlokk, was then arrested at his mother’s house and arraigned in court.  The accused - a factory worker - tried to hold back tears as he stood in the dock, his mother sitting a few metres away.

Her son pleaded not guilty to threatening and seriously injuring his wife, causing her to fear him and damaging her mobile phone. Lawyer Lennox Vella, said this was an isolated incident. The couple had been married 24 years – today – and had children. The man was willing to live at his mother’s house and stay away from his wife.

Drugs found in car stopped for having cardboard number plate,Times of Malta,"Police officers who stopped a car at a Marsa roadblock because it had a cardboard number plate found cocaine, heroin and cannabis inside the vehicle, a court heard on Monday. There were four people inside the car, including a 14-year-old girl. The details were given by Police Inspector Mark Cremona when testifying in the compilation of evidence against 25-year-old Sheridan Lee Grech from Cospicua, 24-year-old Nicole Micallef from Msida and 20-year-old Matthias Borg from Luqa. The 14 year-old was Borg's girlfriend. Her case is being heard in the Juvenile Court. All four are pleading not guilty to the possession of 41 sachets of cocaine and heroin in circumstances which indicated they were not for personal use. Grech is also accused of being in possession of another 52 sachets of cocaine and heroin which were found in his underwear. He was also charged with illegally carrying pepper spray, breaching bail and recidivism. Borg alone is charged with possession of a knuckleduster and a stun gun, with Micallef also being charged with carrying a stun gun and recidivism. Inspector Cremona said that on March 11 at about 3pm police mounted a roadblock Marsa. They noticed a car approach them and its front number plate was of cardboard. When they stopped the car, they smelt cannabis. Grech was at the wheel. Sitting behind him there was the 14-year-old and, behind her, there were some 40 sachets containing what later turned out to be cocaine and heroin. Grech was carrying a black pouch with suspected cannabis and a grinder. He later handed over sachets containing more cocaine and heroin hidden inside his underwear. He had €235 in cash. No illegal substances were found on Borg and Micallef. Borg was found in possession of a taser torch and a knuckleduster in a brown pouch. Micallef also had a taser torch. Police searched Grech’s Cospiqua home and found six mobile phones in his bedroom. Nothing illegal was found in Borg’s Luqa home or in Micallef’s Msida home.

"Murderer appeals conviction, says jail term far exceeded agreed plea bargain",Claudia Calleja,"Eliott Paul Busuttil, who murdered a taxi driver while out on bail for attempting to kill another man has appealed the 42-year-jail term handed down earlier this month. He claimed that the judge should have informed him that she would not adhere to the 35-year jail term agreed by the prosecution and the defence in exchange for a guilty plea.  Busuttil noted that he ended up getting seven years more than he agreed during the sentence bargaining agreement, and he should have been allowed to reconsider his plea. In the appeal application, filed by his lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit, he said that Madame Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrara’s judgment sought to “please the gallery but did not a reflect a sense of justice.” On March 5 Busuttil, 40 of Attard, was jailed for 42 years after he admitted to murdering Mario Farrugia, a 62-year-old taxi driver who was found dead in the trunk of his car in Qormi valley in April 2022, as well as the attempted murder of a second man, Emil Marinov. At the time of the murder, Busuttil was out on bail for the attempted murder of the Bulgarian, who was found in Ta’ Qali in August 2020, after also being stabbed multiple times. Marinov had contacted Busuttil over a Facebook Marketplace advert because he wanted to buy hi-fi equipment – and ended up being slashed 24 times with a butcher’s knife. During the sentencing hearing, the judge noted that there was a sentence bargaining agreement between the Attorney General and the defence for a 35-year jail term after Busuttil pleaded guilty and was told about the legal consequences to his guilty plea.   The judge noted she was not legally bound by the sentence bargaining if she felt this was not fair. On handing down judgment the judge noted that Busuttil tried to kill an innocent man and then managed to kill another. He had learnt nothing from his previous convictions. ""The murder of Mario Farrugia was barbaric as, after he killed him, he hid the body in the boot of a car until he was found,"" she said. ""An innocent man went to buy a stereo and ended up badly injured. Emil, the attempted murder victim, had his head opened up like a book. The court can not accept this animalistic behaviour and the court has to protect society from such cold-blooded people who are ready do to this for €100 euro."" She jailed Busuttil for 42 years and ordered him to pay €70,000 in court costs in two years. In the appeal the lawyers claimed that the judge should have informed the accused that she would not adhere to the agreed 35 years. A declaration in open court, that she was not legally obliged to adhere, was not enough. The lawyers also noted that the judge had wrongly applied caselaw and had not taken into account the submissions on punishment made by both parties. The lawyers noted that the sentence bargaining agreement was reached after lots of work between the parties and the prosecution had kept the victims’ lawyers informed.   The court, they said, had too much discretion in such cases and had veered too far from the jail term agreed on by both parties. The jail term was “exaggerated”, they said as they called on the appeal court to declare the judgment null and send the case back to the first court.

‘€2m’ money laundering case against two butchers fizzles out,Matthew Xuereb,"A couple who own a butcher’s shop in Tarxien have been given suspended sentences for money laundering and ordered to repay the money they made from illegally cashing social benefits cheques handed to them by clients to pay for goods. Anthony Manicaro and his wife Mary Grace, 60, were investigated for money laundering after allegedly registering a €2 million turnover at their Tarxien poultry store between 2013 and 2020 while declaring an annual income of €20,000. However, the court heard they had only made €32,000 from the cheques over those seven years, charging some of their clients €5 per cheque cashed. Police suspicions were first raised by a significant number of cheques deposited into the couple’s joint bank account, many issued by the Central Bank or by third parties. Investigators later spoke to a number of customers, many underprivileged getting by on social benefits, who explained that it was “convenient” for them to cash their cheques at the couple’s store, avoiding long queues at the post office or bank branches. In 2020, husband and wife were charged with money laundering and running an unlicensed financial institution by illegally cashing customers’ social benefits cheques. Both always denied the charges. But they had a change of heart last month and registered a guilty plea. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech handed Anthony Manicaro – now wheelchair bound – a two-year jail term suspended for four years and his wife a two-year jail term suspended for three years. The court found that the woman’s role in the “self-laundering” was minimal. She also fined them €35,000 between them and ordered the seizure of €32,000, the amount they had made for cashing their clients’ cheques. The magistrate applied the new law limiting the confiscation order to the amount that resulted from the case, instead of confiscating all the accused’s property, as was the legal position under the old law. Under the old law, the accused would have then had to institute separate proceedings to recover back all that property, including inherited property or property acquired much before the offence, and which would not have been accrued from proceeds of crime. The couple were also ordered to settle the €9,000 court bill. Over the course of the compilation of evidence against them, the court heard how people living near their shop, many of who had no bank accounts and relied on social benefits, would buy meat and cheeselets from the store and settle the bill using their social benefit cheques. They told police this spared them the long queues at the post office or the bank. Witnesses testified that the butcher would charge €5 for every cheque cashed. However, other clients said they were not charged anything extra for their cheque to be cashed. A father of five explained how he would buy meat and rabbits from the couple’s shop, handing over his weekly €73 social benefits cheque when settling the bill. Another man said that he used to buy poultry and eggs from the shop, “in cash or by cheque, and he [Manicaro] never took anything extra apart from payment for the goods”. The case against them took a twist in 2022 when a prosecution blunder forced a restart after it emerged that the criminal charges had been tweaked along the way without first obtaining the necessary delegation from the Attorney General’s office.

Fraud charges in Malta raise hopes for victims of Chile’s ‘biggest scam’ ,Daniel Ellul,"A fraud case against businessman Alberto Chang Rajii in Malta has renewed hope among victims of an alleged multimillion-dollar scam 7,000 miles away in his native Chile. Rafael Gomez, a lawyer representing 182 people who say they were cheated by Chang Rajii, told Times of Malta they hope he will be deported from Malta “so he could have his day in court here in Chile”. Chile’s Foreign Minister Alberto van Klaveren Stork also referred to possible deportation if Chang Rajii is found guilty of defrauding a Maltese hotel of €5,000.  In Chile, Chang Rajii is accused of a bigger crime: running a Ponzi scheme worth over $80 million that left investors including high-profile celebrities high and dry. “This is a very important case in Chile. What happened was the biggest scam in our country’s history,” Gomez said. Chang Rajii, 50, is the founder of Grupo Arcano, which he set up along with his mother and sold itself as an international private equity and venture capital firm.  Described by Chilean media as the mind behind Chile’s “largest ever pyramid scheme”, Chang Rajii managed to convince around a thousand people to invest with him. His investment firm Onix promised investors soaring returns such as 1.5 per cent a month for an investment of 200 million pesos ($300,000), according to Bloomberg, who said it had seen a contract.  Investors included several celebrities such as television host Jose Miguel Viñuela, actress Josefina Montané, gymnast Tomás González, and 90-year-old painter Mario Toral. Part of Chang Rajii’s allure was the image of success he portrayed.  He was often photographed with celebrities including Richard Branson, Ricky Martin and Stephen Hawking. The large figure allegedly defrauded, and the high-profile status of some clients meant Chang Rajii has garnered a lot of attention in Chile where a docudrama was produced about his life.   But when questions about his investments and some of his other claims began to surface in the spring of 2016, the Chilean investor moved to Malta.  “Warned of what he could face, he chose a jurisdiction that does not have an extradition treaty with Chile, so he went to Malta,” Carlos Gajardo who investigated Chang, told television station CHV Noticias.  Chilean news outlets repeatedly describe Chang Rajii as living a life of luxury in Malta while he was wanted in his home country.  He applied for a Maltese passport under the Individual Investor Programme but failed after the acquisitions in Chile became known.  In a Times of Malta interview the same year, Chang said he had been subjected to a trial by media and that his company had only been forced into default because Chilean prosecutors seized his assets on unproven charges. Chang Rajii’s mother, who co-founded the company, however, has been charged and convicted of fraud.  Chile asked Malta to extradite Chang Rajii in 2016 but Malta refused the request two years later after a court of criminal appeal ruling.  But now he is in trouble with the law in Malta, after an alleged victim saw a notification on his phone about a €500 transfer to a hotel – a payment that he had neither made nor authorised.  Hotel employees pointed the finger at Chang Rajii and he was recently charged over a series of fraud charges.   Chang Rajii was also charged with aggravated theft, being in possession of items related to fraud and for using a counterfeit “non-corporeal non-cash payment instrument” ‒ the cloned copy of the victim’s credit card.  The defence said it would not be requesting bail at this state, given that the accused has no fixed address and no money.  There is now hope that if Chang Rajii is found guilty in Malta, he can be deported back to Chile and face his alleged victims there, Gomez told Times of Malta.  “Some of the victims are in a very good economic situation, but others come from more humble social classes,” Gomez said.  Van Klaveren Stork said since he has been accused of crimes committed in Malta, Chang Rajii could be deported back to Chile if found guilty. “As he would have committed a crime in Malta, there is the possibility of deportation, and deportation would be a much faster and effective procedure than going through an extradition process,” he said. The Maltese fraud case made headlines across Chile.  Flavia Cordella, a journalist who was reporting for TVN Chile in Malta this week, said Chang’s alleged victims are passionate about getting their money back.

Bouncer charged with NYE assault back in court over drug trafficking charges,Edwina Brincat,"One of five bouncers charged earlier this year with assaulting a man in Paceville on New Year’s Eve landed back in court on Saturday accused of trafficking drugs in that entertainment hub.  Petar Bajic, a 35-year-old Serbian national living at Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, was allegedly found in possession of cocaine when approached by police officers on Thursday evening.  Police had been alerted by a caller who claimed that Bajic was trafficking drugs in Paceville. At around 9.30pm, officers approached the suspect as soon as he stepped out of his car.  The man admitted he had drugs in his possession.  A search of the vehicle yielded some 70 grams of cocaine, packed in five-gram sachets, as well as a pair of scales.  Bajic was arrested on the spot. He was one of five security guards who in January was charged with assaulting a man on New Year’s Eve, just minutes before midnight, outside a Paceville club.  A verbal clash between the bouncers and the alleged victim, Ahmed Adam Idriss Albarjo, escalated into physical violence, with video footage showing the alleged victim being beaten, kicked and hit with a retractable baton as he lay on the ground.  The alleged victim was subsequently also charged with slightly injuring one of his aggressors who was struck on the back with a broken glass bottle flung at him by the man who had been denied entry at the club. Bajic was meanwhile also charged with working as a security guard without being duly licenced. On Saturday, Bajic was escorted back to court, charged with supplying or distributing cocaine, involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy and aggravated possession of cocaine under circumstances denoting that the drug was not for his personal use. He was further charged with committing the alleged offences within 100 metres of a place where young people habitually met.  He pleaded not guilty.  The court upheld the prosecution’s request for a freezing order over all assets of the accused, except for the monthly allowance in terms of the law.  No request for bail was made at arraignment stage and the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, remanded the accused in custody. Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.

Putin vows retribution for concert hall attack as death toll climbs to 133,AFP,"Updated 8.40pm Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday vowed to punish those behind a ""barbaric terrorist attack"" on a Moscow concert hall that killed more than 130, saying Russia had arrested four gunmen who were trying to flee to Ukraine.  Kyiv has strongly denied any connection, and Putin made no reference to claims of responsibility by the Islamic State group (IS) in his first public remarks on the attack.  At least 133 people were killed when camouflaged gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall, in Moscow's northern suburb of Krasnogorsk, and then set fire to the building on Friday evening.  The jihadist group has claimed the attack, writing Saturday on a Telegram channel that it was ""carried out by four IS fighters armed with machine guns, a pistol, knives and firebombs,"" as part of ""the raging war"" with ""countries fighting Islam"". It is the deadliest attack in Russia for almost two decades and the deadliest in Europe to have been claimed by IS. Russian officials expect the death toll to rise further, with more than 100 injured in hospital. ""Terrorists, murderers, non-humans ... have only one unenviable fate: retribution and oblivion,"" Putin said in a televised address to the nation on Saturday. Calling the attack a ""barbaric, terrorist act"", he said ""all four direct perpetrators ... all those who shot and killed people, have been found and detained"". ""They tried to escape and were travelling towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,"" he added.   Putin also compared the attackers to ""Nazis"" and said the attack was an ""atrocity, a strike against Russia and our people"". He named Sunday a day of national mourning.  Russia arrested 11 people in connection with the attack on Saturday, the FSB security service said. ""All the perpetrators, organisers and those who ordered this crime will be justly and inevitably punished,"" Putin said.  The FSB said earlier that the assailants had ""contacts"" in Ukraine, without providing further details.  Kyiv, facing a Russian military offensive for the past two years, had ""nothing to do"" with the attack, presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said in a statement.  Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Saturday he hoped ""this terrible tragedy will not become a pretext for anyone to escalate violence and aggression.""  Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the burnt-out building on Saturday. ""The emergency services have found more bodies while clearing the debris,"" it said in a statement on Telegram. ""The number of people killed in the terrorist attack has risen to 133. Search operations continue."" The governor of the Moscow region said rescuers would continue to scour the site for ""several days."" Some 107 people were still in hospital, many in a critical condition, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said. IS had first claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday night, repeating its claim again on Saturday. Some witnesses filmed the gunmen from the upper floors as they walked through the stalls shooting people, footage shared on social media showed. Then ""the terrorists used a flammable liquid to set fire to the concert hall's premises, where spectators were located, including wounded,"" the Investigative Committee said. Investigators said people died both from gunshot wounds and smoke inhalation after a fire engulfed the 6,000-seater venue. Flames quickly spread through the venue on Friday, with screaming concert-goers rushing to emergency exits.  Investigators also said they would issue an award to a man who had jumped on one of the attackers while he was shooting at the concert-goers, ""immobilising"" the gunman and ""saving the lives of people around him"". Putin did not address IS's claim of responsibility in his first public remarks on Saturday, which came more than 18 hours after the start of the attack. The head of the state-run RT media outlet, Margarita Simonyan posted two videos claiming to be interrogations of two handcuffed suspects, who both admitted to the attack but did not say who organised it.  The interior ministry said all four of the suspected gunmen were foreign nationals, as Russian Telegram channels -- including those with links to the security services -- said they were from Tajikistan, a country that borders Afghanistan and where the jihadist group is active. Tajikistan's foreign ministry told Russia's TASS news agency that authorities were ""in close contact"" with Moscow about the ""supposed participation of the country's citizens in the terrorist attack"". In Moscow, residents stood in long lines in the rain to donate blood for those hospitalised, and mourners came to lay flowers outside the concert hall. Memorial posters featuring a single candle replaced some advertising billboards in the capital. Major events were cancelled across the country, including a friendly football match between Russia and Paraguay set to take place in Moscow on Monday. Statements of condemnation from world leaders continued to roll in.   - US warning dismissed -Russia's powerful intelligence services were also in the spotlight in the wake of the attack. Just three days earlier, Putin had publicly dismissed a US warning of an ""imminent"" attack in Moscow as propaganda designed to scare Russian citizens. The US embassy in Russia had warned on 7 March that ""extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts"".  Washington said after the attack it had also shared details directly with Moscow. But speaking to FSB chiefs last Tuesday, Putin had called it a ""provocative"" statement and ""outright blackmail... to intimidate and destabilise our society"".

Women's lobby slams court over failure to protect victims in Marsa stabbing case,Times of Malta,"The Women's Lobby has slammed the courts for not issuing a protection order in favour of three children and their mother after the woman's ex-partner viciously attacked the kids earlier this month. Nazzareno Dalli is being charged with the attempted murder of his ex-partner's daughters, aged 12 and 15 in their home in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on March 9.  Known as Ronald, the 43-year-old is also being charged with attacking the girls, causing them grievous bodily harm, and holding them against their will. He is also accused of carrying a sharp and pointed object without a licence, drug possession, illegally working as a private guard, and recidivism.  Dalli is pleading not guilty. On Friday a court heard how one of the girls had ""miraculously"" survived the attack when she was stabbed in the heart and lost up to 40 per cent of her blood. Dalli had been in a three-year relationship with the mother and refused to accept the fact that she wanted to break up.  On Saturday, the Malta Women's Lobby questioned why the woman was made to testify in person rather than video conferencing. It said in a statement that Friday's sitting revealed ""deeply troubling aspects"" of the case and ""disrespect for the victims"", especially when the court decided not to issue a protection order in favour of the traumatised mother and her three children. ""Instead, the court preferred to adhere to the defence’s arguments because the aggressor is still in preventive custody. ""The MWL reiterates that the nature of a protection order is purely to prevent an offence from happening, ensure safety, and offer peace of mind to the victims or potential victims,"" the lobby said. ""The law further stipulates that it may be necessary to ensure public peace. This heinous crime is a crime against the public too, so even in this regard, its precautionary nature would help ensure public peace."" It insisted that issuing a protection order would not have caused any detriment or prejudice to the accused but, to the contrary, has much to offer to the victims who have been left without the necessary protection. ""The other troubling aspect is that the mother of the children was made to testify in person, not via video conference, after such a traumatic event. ""This shows a lack of support and insensitivity in such cases,"" it added. The lobby ""demanded better"" from the courts and questioned who would shoulder the responsibility if further damage was inflicted on the victims.

"Attack at Moscow concert leaves more than 60 dead, Isis claims responsibility",AFP,"Updated Saturday 6am Gunmen who opened fire at a Moscow concert hall killed more than 60 people and wounded over 100 while sparking an inferno, authorities said Saturday, with the Islamic State group claiming responsibility. Attackers dressed in camouflage uniforms entered the building, opened fire and threw a grenade or incendiary bomb, according to a journalist for the RIA Novosti news agency at the scene. The fire quickly spread through the Crocus City concert hall in the Krasnogorsk suburb in the north of the Russian capital, which can hold several thousand people and has hosted top international artists.   ""According to preliminary information, 40 people were killed and more than 100 were injured as a result of a terrorist attack in the Crocus City Hall,"" according to the FSB security service, quoted by Interfax news agency and other Russian media. Authorities said a ""terrorist"" investigation had been started and President Vladimir Putin was receiving ""constant"" updates on the attack, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.  Telegram news channels Baza and Mash, which are close to security forces, showed video images of flames and black smoke pouring from the hall. Other images showed two men walking through the hall with at least one person left on the ground near the entrance. Concert-goers were also seen hiding behind seats or trying to escape. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there had been a ""terrible tragedy"" at the concert by Russian rock band Piknik and cancelled all public events in the city for the weekend. Security services quoted by Interfax news agency said between two and five people ""wearing tactical uniforms and carrying automatic weapons"" opened fire on guards at the entrance and then started shooting at the audience. ""People who were in the hall were led on the ground to protect themselves from the shooting for 15 or 20 minutes,"" the RIA Novosti journalist was quoted as saying. People started crawling out when it was safe, the journalist reported.   The main intelligence directorate of the Ukrainian defence ministry meanwhile accused Russian secret services of planning the deadly attack. ""The terrorist attack in Moscow was a planned and deliberate provocation by the Russian special services on (Vladimir) Putin's orders,"" the service said on Telegram, adding that the aim was to ""further escalate and expand the war"" with Ukraine.   About 100 people escaped through the theatre basement while others were sheltering on the roof, the emergency services ministry said on its Telegram channel. But about one-third of the complex was ablaze, TASS news agency reported. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""bloody terrorist attack"". ""The whole international community must condemn this odious crime,"" she said on Telegram. The US presidency called the attack ""terrible"" but said there was no immediate sign of any link to the conflict in Ukraine. ""There is no indication at this time that Ukraine or Ukrainians were involved in the shooting,"" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev vowed on Telegram that Ukraine's top officials ""must be found and ruthlessly destroyed as terrorists"" if they were linked to the attack. ""I offer my condolences to the families of the dead,"" said Moscow's mayor as a major security operation was launched around the theatre and nearby shopping mall. TASS said that SOBR, special police forces and the OMON anti-riot squad had been sent to the Crocus hall. It added that all the members of the rock band had been evacuated safely. Orthodox church leader Patriarch Kirill was ""praying for peace for the souls of the dead,"" said his spokesman Vladimir Legoyda.   Moscow and other Russian cities have been the targets of previous attacks by Islamist groups but there have also been incidents without any clear political motive.  Earlier this month, the US embassy in Russia warned ""extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow"", including concerts. In 2002, Chechen separatist fighters took 912 people hostage in a Moscow theatre, the Dobrovka, demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from the region. Special forces attacked the theatre to end the hostage-taking and 130 people were killed, nearly all suffocated by a gas used by security forces to knock out the gunmen. Russia launched a military intervention in Ukraine in February 2022 and it has been the target of attacks along the border by anti-Kremlin forces. Ukraine's presidency and the Freedom of Russia Legion, whose fighters are part of Ukraine's armed forces, denied any role in the concert hall attack.

"Girl, 12, was stabbed in the heart by mother's ex, court hears",Giulia Magri,"A girl who ""miraculously"" survived a vicious attack by her mother's ex-partner was stabbed in the heart and lost up to 40 per cent of her blood, doctors testified on Friday.  The court heard how the mother was in a three-year relationship with the accused, Nazzareno Dalli, and how he refused to accept the fact that she wanted to break up.  Dalli, known as Ronald, had spent the evening before the alleged accident out with friends and family members drinking and taking drugs, the court heard. During a police interrogation, he said how after taking a particular substance in his drink he “did not remember what happened next”.  Dalli, 43, is charged with attempted murder of his ex partner's daughters, who are 12 and 15 years old, in their home in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on March 9.  He is also charged with attacking the girls, causing them grievous bodily harm, and holding them against their will. He is also accused of carrying a sharp and pointed object without a licence, drug possession, illegally working as a private guard, and recidivism.  Dalli is pleading not guilty.  The compilation of evidence against Dalli began on Friday, with the court hearing from parties involved in the investigation. The mother told the court that around noon on March 9, she left home to go shopping.  “One child was playing Playstation on the bed, the other I left sleeping, and the other was playing on the phone,” she said. She recalled the shock when she returned home to see her son out in the street with blood on him. Police were stationed outside her home, and did not let her enter the building.  “I was in a big shock. They told me that my daughter lost a lot of blood, and I was crying... when they brought her out. She was covered in blood and I didn’t recognise her,” she said.  She recalls seeing her other daughter on the roof and was worried she was going to jump. After accompanying her daughters in an ambulance to Mater Dei Hospital, she spent a restless night “crying and panicking”. Medical staff told her it was a “miracle” her daughter survived.  “My daughter is covered with cuts… her back, her leg… it’s scary to look at her,” she recounted in tears.  She said she never gave Dalli a key and suspected that he somehow managed to make a copy. When asked about Dalli's motive, she said she wanted to end the relationship.  She told the accused they should end their three-year relationship as they were not getting along, but he refused to accept. She had also spent a week in a domestic shelter.  One evening he went outside her home and he was banging on the main door. She told him she could call the police if he refused to leave. When the mother mentioned a previous court case after Dalli had threatened her and her daughter, the defence team interrupted and said he had been acquitted.  When defence lawyer Mario Mifsud went to cross-examine the mother, she interrupted him and repeated what Dalli had once told her: ""Mill-ħabs toħroġ, imma mil-qabar ma' tqumx"" (One can leave prison, but not the grave).  She also addressed Mifsud by name and said he should know what she is experiencing, as he is also a father.   Mater Dei emergency doctors Josef Mifsud and Fatma Kablan, who treated the two girls, also testified on Friday.  Mifsud went into detail about the critical conditions of the 12-year-old girl, who suffered from 16 stab wounds.  He said the young girl was in a state of confusion and had lost around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of her blood. Emergency doctors administered three bags of blood to the patient. Once she was treated in the emergency department, a CT scan was carried out and established internal bleeding in her stomach.  The girl's heart and lungs were penetrated, and parts of her spleen and liver were torn. There were also puncture wounds in her left kidney and pancreas as well as broken ribs on the left side.  The girl had to be intubated to keep her breathing. Police inspector Ian Vella told the court that the accused said he could not believe what had happened to the girls, claiming he loved them as though they were his daughters.  “He was perplexed, and could not understand what happened,” Vella said. During the interrogation, Dalli confirmed he was working as a security guard at a bar in Marsascala. He told police how after completing his duties at around 4am, he stayed at the bar with his sister and two Serbian nationals,  drinking and taking drugs.  Afterwards, they went to the Red Stars bar in Żejtun, where they continued to drink and take more drugs.  Dalli told the police how one of the Serbians had sold him another substance, which was put into his glass. He drank it, went to the bathroom and said he could not recall what happened after that. When asked to clarify what drugs had been taken, Vella said Dalli said he had taken cocaine. The other substance was not named. Vella said that pictures posted on social media showed Dalli’s presence at both bars. “The pictures also show the 30cm knife tucked in Dalli’s belt,” Vella said. He said the pictures were captioned with the word “revenge”.  A police officer went into detail about how when they arrived at the scene, they saw a young boy outside the house wearing shorts and a vest and no shoes.  “He was worried and in a state of panic,” he said, adding how the young boy said Dalli had stabbed his family.  The police entered the Marsa home, and saw the 30cm knife behind the entrance door, with the handle wrapped in a cloth and the blade covered in blood. Officer Damion Galea said he heard cries from upstairs, and when he went up the blood-stained stairs, he saw a young girl on the floor bleeding. When he lifted her shirt to see where the blood was coming from, he saw many wounds on her belly, arms, and back.  He called for an ambulance and tried to stop the bleeding, but it was very difficult. The girl had trouble breathing and she was close to being unconscious. Officer Ramona Magro said while her colleague stayed with the younger girl, she went up to the roof, as she was informed there was another victim on the washroom roof. “When I asked her if she was injured, she showed me her hand, which was covered in blood and cuts,” Magro testified. “The bone was showing in one of the cuts,” she said, her voice shaking.  Attorney General lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech led the prosecution, together with Police Inspectors Ian Vella and Wayne Camilleri.  Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Nicholas Mifsud, Mario Mifsud, Jacob Magri, and Franco Debono appeared for Dalli.  The next sitting will take place next month.

Court confirms bail for Lilu King,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 4.15pm The Criminal Court has confirmed bail for Lilu King, warning that his freedom from arrest would be ""immediately revoked"" if he approached any prosecution witness.  That was the outcome of a decree delivered on Friday afternoon by Madam Justice Edwina Grima turning down the Attorney General's request for the bail to be revoked.  Paceville entrepreneur and social media influencer Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, known as Lilu King, was granted bail by the magistrate presiding over the compilation of evidence where he stands accused of involvement in an organised group linked to drug trafficking and money laundering.  He is pleading not guilty. On Tuesday, after several previous bail requests had failed, the defence's latest attempt proved successful.  Magistrate Leonard Caruana upheld the request and granted bail against a deposit of €30,000, a personal guarantee of €40,000, a third party surety for €10,000, signing the bail book daily and a curfew between 9pm and 7am. The Attorney General filed an application before the Criminal Court to have the bail revoked.  That request was turned down on Friday, but the judge added one more condition.  The court bound Elmushraty not to approach any of the prosecution witnesses in any manner, whether directly or indirectly by phone or some other means of communication.  Should the court be informed that the accused breached this condition, his bail would be immediately revoked.  In her appeal, the AG cited the risk of absconding, tampering with evidence as well as the accused's lack of trustworthiness.  Elmushraty was a ""prohibited immigrant"" who was also wanted by Libyan authorities for investigation over certain crimes allegedly committed in that country. He was facing serious accusations, primarily involvement in a criminal organisation.  When deciding upon such a request, the court must assess whether the first court had exercised its discretion in a manner that was ""evidently wrong"", both factually and legally, said Judge Grima.  In this case, the prosecution had aired its objections before the Magistrates' Court and also declared that there were no further civilian witnesses to testify.  That eliminated the risk of tampering, especially since sworn statements by various witnesses were already preserved in the records of the case.  Thus, the judge found no reason to depart from the decision of the first court which had imposed conditions that offered the necessary guarantee in terms of law.  There was daily signing of the bail book, strict curfew hours, a hefty deposit, a considerable personal guarantee and a third party surety over and above.  But there was another condition that was missing, said the judge, ordering the accused not to approach prosecution witnesses in any manner.

Spain police bust gang running night flight 'hash'copters,AFP,"Spanish police said on Friday they had broken up a gang specialising in night-time helicopter flights to bring in hashish from Morocco, during a joint operation with their Moroccan counterparts. During the operation, police seized two helicopters and nearly 800 kilograms of hashish, arresting nine people, two of whom were ""pilots with expertise in flying at night"", the Guardia Civil police said.  They said investigators spotted a helicopter taking off from a ranch near the southern port city of Cadiz in the early hours of January 15 and then flying at low altitude, without lights, towards Morocco.   Moroccan police identified the helicopter entering the country's national airspace, landing for ""a few minutes"" and then flying back. The chopper was intercepted by Spanish police after landing at the ranch in Chiclana de la Frontera, just south of Cadiz.  On board, they found 30 bundles containing 795 kilograms of hashish and arrested five people, also seizing three vehicles at the ranch.  During the raid, one gang leader died in a car crash close to the site where the helicopter was intercepted. The Guardia Civil said he appeared to have crashed ""as he fled the scene at high speed"".  Investigators later arrested another four people at a ranch in Utrera near the southern city of Seville, where they seized a second helicopter ""which was being fitted out to carry out drug-carrying flights"".  The helicopters had been acquired in eastern Europe and their rear seats removed to allow them to carry up to 900 kilograms of hashish per flight, the police said.  Spain is one of the main entry points for drugs into Europe given its close ties with Latin America and its proximity to Morocco Latin America is the main source of cocaine and Morocco is a key source of hashish, a sticky brown substance made from the resin of the cannabis plant.

'Irreversible damage' to gold medals recovered after Maritime Museum theft,Matthew Xuereb,"Two medals stolen from the Maritime Museum earlier this week sustained ""irreversible damage "", a court heard on Thursday.  Police inspector Paul Camilleri told Magistrate Nadine Lia that Justin Mallia, 25, from Cospicua stole the gold medals to settle debts. He was arrested before he had time to sell the items worth €400,000. Camilleri was testifying in the compilation of evidence against Mallia who denies aggravated theft, being in possession of the two illegally acquired medals belonging to the government of Malta and defrauding the Maritime Museum.  It emerged that Mallia was given bail just days before being charged with stealing the medals from the Vittoriosa museum.   He also stands charged with breaching three bail decrees, the latest one given on March 6.  According to Heritage Malta, the medals were awarded between 1800 and 1801 to leaders and distinguished members of the National Congress battalions who fought to liberate Malta from the French. They are very rare and, therefore, valuable, particularly because of their historical significance to Malta's history. During his arraignment earlier this week, Mallia first registered an admission, saying he had stolen the medals to settle a pending debt he incurred to pay for bail in a separate case. He then retracted his admission.  Inspector Camilleri on Thursday explained that the suspect had posed as an official from the education department, visiting the museum to deliver documents. An event for schoolchildren was taking place at the time and he was granted access. Mallia, who is known to the police, was later identified on CCTV footage and the police traced him to an address that was different to the one registered for previous bail purposes.  When they knocked on his door, he gave them a pouch containing the medals. The inspector said the medals sustained damage inside the pouch as they were brushing against other items.  He said the medals were inside a showcase that was forced open when Mallia stole them. The case continues. Inspectors Antonello Magri and Paul Camilleri together with AG lawyers Etienne Savona, Alessia Schembri and Nicholas Degaetano prosecuted.  Lawyer Alfred Abela was defence counsel.  The museum only reopened its doors last month after four years for a new year-long exhibition being held in newly restored sections of the museum.  Built by the British in 1842 on the ruins of a Knight-era arsenal, the building mainly served as a bakery for the Mediterranean Fleet. It was converted into a museum in 1992.

Fifty-five people accused of sexual harassment in three years,Giulia Magri,"Fifty-five people were arraigned and accused of crimes related to sexual harassment in the past three years, figures tabled in parliament on Wednesday showed.  According to the data, 14 people were arraigned in 2021; 19 in 2022, and 22 last year. The figures were provided by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri in reply to a parliamentary question by Opposition MP Darren Carabott. Out of the 22 people who were accused of sexual harassment last year, 17 cases are awaiting decision and one case ended in acquittal. Probation orders were issued in two cases, with one of them also including 50 hours of community service. In another case, the accused was given a suspended sentence and a restraining order for three years, and one case involved the accused being released on condition. Out of the 19 cases in 2022, nine are awaiting decision, and one case ended in acquittal. Two cases ended with conditional release for two years and one involved the offender being given a probation order and 40 hours of community service. Carabott also asked the minister how many people were accused of sexual harassment at work between 2020 and 2022.  In total, eight were taken to court, one in 2020, four in 2021, and three in 2022. The figures come after a recent report from the National Statistics Office (NSO) highlighted how more than a quarter of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. According to the report, just over 27% of women said they faced sexual harassment at work, compared to just 11% of men.  Over 3,000 women were surveyed between February and May 2022 alongside just under 2,000 men. The survey was carried out to measure how common gender-based violence is in Malta.

Lawrence Abina jailed for life for strangling partner Rita Ellul to death,Matthew Xuereb,"Updated 4.51pm with further details on court's sentence. Lawrence Abina, 32, was on Wednesday jailed for life after being convicted of strangling his partner to death while she slept.  ""The court cannot ignore the heinous nature of the crime committed…the callous way in which it was executed, by manual strangulation, whilst the victim was asleep and therefore helpless,” Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras said following a unanimous verdict by jurors who deliberated for four hours.  Abina was convicted of murdering the mother of three in an apartment in Għajnsielem, Gozo, in February 2022. He had pleaded not guilty when his trial began but prosecutor Kaylie Bonnet told the jury that Abina had confessed to killing Ellul on three different occasions to different people.  Despite initially claiming another version of events had occurred, once he was presented with evidence, Abina’s story about how he had strangled Ellul with his bare hands had been consistent, she said.  There had also been previous incidents of domestic violence and Ellul had reported him to the police twice. Last week a police inspector who interrogated Abina told the jury that after initially denying all claims of violence, Abina had admitted to killing Ellul, saying he was deeply sorry and wanted to be forgiven. He had told police that he feared she was going out with another man, called Stefan, who later turned out to be a fictitious man made him up by Ellul so that Abina would give her more attention. The jury heard the couple argued frequently after she discovered he was seeing other women and having sex with prostitutes.  Abina told police he had wanted to stop strangling the victim, but feared jail time if she survived the incident and reported him. AG lawyers Nathaniel Falzon and Mauro Abela also prosecuted.  In their submissions on punishment, parte civile lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri noted the unanimous verdict. The court, they said, should take that in consideration when meting out punishment. They said there were no mitigating defences such as provocation or sudden passion. ""Justice is done with families who have suffered so much,"" Debono said as he took the opportunity to point out that the injured party should be allowed to participate more at trial. The prosecution requested the maximum penalty of life in prison. In her submissions on punishment, AG lawyer and chief prosecutor Kaylie Bonnet said Abina was found guilty of the most heinous crime - wilful homicide. He killed his intimate partner in bed while she was sleeping and soon after having had intercourse. She said one could only imagine the high degree of agony, pain and suffering Ellul went through. Abina had also pursued a violent course of conduct towards Ellul for a number of years. This violent behaviour ruined her life and ruined the lives of her living relatives. “He has no place in society,” she stressed. Legal aid defence counsel Simon Micallef Stafrace said there was not much he could say, asking the court to consider anything which was not life in jail, such as 40 or 45 years. Abina was also ordered to pay €16,000 in court costs within 24 months. In her judgment, Madam Justice Galea Sciberras noted that Abina committed the crime in a premeditated way, motivated by jealousy, after having accused Ellul of infidelity, which he had himself previously admitted to having committed in her regard. She observed that Abina disturbed the scene of the crime and then “cold-bloodedly” went to work, only to return home “pretending that he had just found Ellul dead, trying to make one think that she had died through natural causes.” “In the court’s view, a crime such as this must be punished to the full extent of the law and, in view of the unanimous vote reached by the jury, it is obliged to mete out the punishment of life imprisonment,” she said.

Man 'posed as education official' to steal gold medals from Maritime Museum,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 2pm with Heritage Malta statement A 25-year-old Cospicua resident who was given bail just days ago has been charged with stealing two gold medals valued at €400,000 from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa. Justin Mallia was on Tuesday escorted to court to face charges of aggravated theft, being in possession of the two illegally acquired medals belonging to the government of Malta and defrauding the Maritime Museum.  He was also charged with breaching three bail decrees, the latest one given on March 6.  The accused risked forfeiting €20,800 in bail money.  According to Heritage Malta, the medals were awarded between 1800 and 1801 to leaders and distinguished members of the National Congress battalions who fought to liberate Malta from the French. They are very rare and, therefore, valuable, particularly because of their historical significance to Malta's history.   Mallia first registered an admission, saying he had stolen the medals to settle a pending debt he incurred to pay for bail in a separate case.  When explaining the events leading to the arrest, the prosecution said the suspect had posed as an official from the Education Department, visiting the museum to deliver documents. An event for schoolchildren was taking place at the time and he was granted access. Mallia, who is well known to the police, was subsequently clearly identified on CCTV footage and the police managed to track him down at an address that was different to the one registered for previous bail purposes.  When they knocked on his door, he gave them a pouch containing the medals. His lawyer contested the fraud charge, arguing it would be absorbed by the charge of aggravated theft. The accused then piped in, saying he had changed his mind and retracted his guilty plea. Magistrate Charmaine Galea had previously informed the accused he was facing the prospect of a maximum jail term of eight years. No request for bail was made at this stage and Mallia was remanded in custody.  Inspectors Antonello Magri and Paul Camilleri together with AG lawyers Etienne Savona, Alessia Schembri and Nicholas Degaetano prosecuted.  In a statement sent before the arraignment, the police said the theft was reported at 2pm on Monday. Investigations followed and the suspect, a 26-year-old man from Cospicua, was arrested about two hours later. An inquiry is also being held. In a statement, Heritage Malta said the police caught the alleged thief in a few hours thanks to the immediate action taken by museum officials and the significant investment in the museum's security systems. This enabled the police to promptly identify and apprehend the man. Heritage Malta thanked the police for their professionalism and for the efficiency demonstrated by all the officers involved. The museum only reopened its doors last month after four years for a new year-long exhibition being held in newly restored sections of the museum.  Built by the British in 1842 on the ruins of a Knight-era arsenal, the building mainly served as a bakery for the Mediterranean Fleet. It was converted into a museum in 1992.

Lilu King wins battle for bail,Edwina Brincat,"Paceville entrepreneur and social media influencer ‘Lilu King’ has been granted bail, 10 months after he was arraigned alongside two other suspects over his alleged involvement in an organised crime group linked to drug trafficking and money laundering. Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, who is protesting his innocence, had filed several previous bail requests, all of which previously proved unsuccessful. His lawyers constantly highlighted the fact that although prosecutors alleged that he was involved in drug trafficking, police lacked sufficient evidence to press drug-related charges. Investigators confirmed that no drugs were found in the accused’s possession when his property was searched following his arrest in May. However, seven months later, pending ongoing criminal proceedings, the prosecution informed the court that they wanted to add drug trafficking and involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy to Elmushraty’s charge sheet. That information triggered some tense legal arguments between the prosecution and Elmushraty’s lawyers who strongly objected to the prosecution’s move, arguing that proceedings would have to start again from scratch since the defence had every right to ask for all witnesses who had already testified, to testify again. The prosecution’s request was upheld in January and the new charges were added. When the proceedings resumed before a different magistrate - following the Chief Justice's re-assignment of duties  - the defence’s latest application for bail was upheld. Through a decree delivered on Monday, Magistrate Leonard Caruana upheld the request against a deposit of €30,000, a personal guarantee of €40,000, a third party surety for €10,000, signing the bail book at the Ħamrun police station daily and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am. The case continues. Lawyers Franco Debono, Jose Herrera and Marion Camilleri are defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Nine arrested for attack on French police station,AFP,"Nine people have been arrested over a firework attack on a police station near major venues for this summer's Paris Olympics, the French capital's top police official said on Monday. The Sunday evening attack in the northern suburb of La Courneuve came days after a teenager riding a moped was killed in a car chase with police, echoing a June killing that triggered days-long riots. ""Around 50 people attacked the police station in La Courneuve, mostly with mortar fireworks,"" Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told broadcaster TF1. Videos posted on social media showed groups of people firing a barrage of fireworks at the building's facade. Police said the attackers also threw stones and Molotov cocktails. Police responded with sting-ball grenades and flash-ball projectiles, used by riot police as an alternative to firearms. The standoff lasted for about 30 minutes, Nunez said. The police station suffered no damage. La Courneuve is located in Paris' northern suburbs, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department that hosts Olympic venues including the flagship Stade de France stadium. ""We can tie this attack to the death"" of the 18-year-old killed on Wednesday, named only as Wanys R., Nunez said. ""The young people clearly came from the neighbourhood"" where Wanys lived, he added. ""We did this to demand justice for Wanys,"" one young man told AFP on Monday. He declined to give his name, as did several other residents who came forward. Nunz said the arrested suspects included seven adults aged 18-21 and two minors. Two police officers were ""slightly hurt"", he added. Nunez said police reinforcements would be deployed in the area around midday on Monday, although further attacks were unlikely. Wanys R. was being chased by police on Wednesday after refusing to stop for a check. A video widely shared online showed how his scooter was struck by a police car, killing him and injuring his passenger. The lawyer representing Wanys' family on Friday accused the police of hitting him on purpose, while the officers' own representative insisted it was an accident. Residents told AFP that they condemned the attack on the police station. ""The Olympics aren't our concern but this gives us a bad reputation and that's not good for business,"" said a local grocery shop owner. ""It's sad to lose a child but don't take it out on the neighbourhood,"" said Anissa, another resident.  ""It's stupid to destroy our neighbourhood. We'll be left with nothing,"" she said. In June, a video of a police officer shooting dead 17-year-old Nahel M. triggered nights of riots in gritty Paris suburbs and other deprived areas. The policeman who fired the fatal shot has been charged with voluntary homicide. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

MFSA issues warning about four unlicensed investment entities,Times of Malta,"The Malta Financial Services Authority on Monday issued a warning about four entities claiming they offer licensed financial services. A list of entities licensed by the MFSA can be here. People who fall victim to a scam or believe they are dealing with an unauthorised entity can contact MFSA here. Libra The authority said it has become aware of an entity operating under the name Libra which has various Facebook pages and has been running sponsored videos promoting an AI Trading Tool.  It warned that while videos and images may seem legitimate, entities make use of AI technology to manipulate visuals so consumers should conduct research before engaging in any transactions of financial services. It added that Libra was not licenced or authorised by the MFSA to provide any financial services under Maltese law. According to information available to the MFSA, Libra ""is likely to be a scheme of dubious nature with a high risk of loss of money"". It therefore urged people to refrain from undertaking any business or transactions with the entity. ZBXChange  The MFSA also warned about ZBXChange which has an internet presence at https://zbxchange.link and https://zbxchange.com/ These websites list the details of an MFSA-licensed company called Zillion Bits Ltd to deceive the public, MFSA said in a statement. These two websites appear to be clones of the website of the legitimate entity and the public should therefore refrain from entering into any transactions with them. They are also not Maltese-registered companies and are not authorised to provide any financial services in or from Malta.  Investoscope or Investoscope Mining The MFSA said it has also become aware of an entity operating under the name of Investoscope or Investoscope Mining which has an internet presence at https://www.investoscope.io The entity purports to be “a Maltese-directed investment services supplier” that is “authorised and regulated by the MFSA”.

Man spared jail after injuring three people because behaviour 'out of character',Edwina Brincat,"A man who injured three pedestrians outside an Iklin club while trying to square it off with a bouncer who had just shown him the door has been spared an effective prison term only because his behaviour appeared to be “out of character”. The incident was reported in February of last year, when Carlos Cardona, a 46-year-old Marsa resident, was involved in an argument inside the club.  He continued to argue with the bouncers who escorted him outside, uttering foul language as he headed for his car parked nearby.  Two couples who happened to be exiting the club at the time witnessed the verbal spat and the events that followed.  One man recalled that the accused was arguing with one of the bouncers before he went to his car, reversed towards a roundabout and then drove straight at him as he stepped outside the club with his wife and brother.  That woman testified that she had just exited the club when she saw a green Mazda Demio heading in her direction, the driver shouting, “come out if you’re a man so I can knock you down.”  The driver knocked down her brother-in-law’s wife, who happened to be crossing the road.  Court heard that the man eventually drove off and was subsequently arrested at his home, smelling of alcohol.  He refused a breathalyser test and a medical examination after failing to get in touch with his lawyer, saying he would rather not answer police questions.  Cardona’s wife, who had been with him at the club, later told police that she did not get into the car with her husband but left the club, heading in the direction of San Ġwann on foot.  When giving his statement to the police, Cardona did not seem to recall any argument with third parties at the club, nor was he under the impression that bouncers had escorted him outside. He said that he had walked to the car and, as he drove towards his wife, he felt a bump.  Then suddenly “everyone began to hit me through the [vehicle’s] window”.  He put the car in gear and drove off with “one of them hanging onto the window”, the accused claimed.  Cardona faced a raft of charges including grievously injuring two of the victims, attempting to grievously injure two others, slightly injuring one of the women, dangerous and reckless driving, driving under the influence as well as failing to supply personal details to the police and breaching public peace.  He pleaded not guilty.  When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed that the accused intended to cause harm. The fact that rather than control himself, he chose to fight and confront the bouncer, proved that.  He was in such an angry state that, rather than join his wife who had left on foot in the opposite direction, he drove back to the club to continue where he had left off, challenging the bouncer to step outside.  He wanted to continue the argument in the state he was in. Nor did the court believe the accused who later claimed that he had mistakenly put his automatic vehicle in gear instead of reverse and that was when it went forward. That account was not corroborated by eyewitnesses who said that the accused first smashed into a wall and then drove straight at pedestrians who were crossing the road.  In light of all evidence, the court declared Cardona guilty of grievously injuring the two brothers and slightly injuring one of their wives. One of the victims suffered a cut on the head and cuts on his fingers and hand that could result in permanent scarring. His brother suffered a fractured finger.  The accused was also found guilty of dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol and breaching public peace.  When meting out punishment, the court noted that Cardona was not a first-time offender and that the incident, which involved three victims, could have had far more serious consequences.  However, the incident appeared to be “out of character” and that was the only reason why the court decided to spare the accused effective imprisonment.  He was condemned to a two-year jail term suspended for three years, a €1,050 fine and a two-year driving ban.  He was also placed under a supervision and treatment order for two years and ordered to pay €1,065.40 in court expert expenses. Moreover, the court ordered Cardona to compensate the victims €800, €400 and €150 respectively.  Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Andrew Agius Bonello prosecuted.

"Accused followed Rita Ellul from Gozo to Malta, daughter claims",Giulia Magri,"The daughter of murder victim Rita Ellul told a court how her mother had confided in her that the man accused of killing her had previously followed her from Gozo to Malta.  The trial of Lawrence Abina, 32, who is accused of strangling Ellul to death on February 26, 2022, in an Għajnsielem apartment, continued on Saturday, with the jury hearing several witnesses involved in the investigation. Abina denies all charges brought against him.  The court heard from Jessica Ellul, one of the victim's three daughters, who went into detail about her niece’s First Holy Communion in July 2020, when her mother was meant to arrive in Malta from Gozo and attend the celebration at the church.  She said her mother arrived late and went straight to the party afterward, held at the home of one of her sisters.  At the time, Jessica said, her mother was still living with Abina in Gozo, so she had to catch the ferry to Malta. When her mother arrived at the party, she noticed that her mother seemed worried. “I know my mother, I can tell when something is off,” Jessica said.  She said that after an hour, her mother was already preparing to leave the party, and both sisters asked why. She said her mother had said she had plans to meet friends at Gianpula.  “I noticed that she was doing things she doesn’t usually do, such as taking pictures of the children playing. She did this to send pictures to Lawrence to prove that she was with her daughters. I know this because my mum later opened up to me.” When their mother left, the sisters discussed how they noticed something was different about their mother. Working two jobs, Jessica recalled how she would try to meet her mother after she finished work, but her mother would always decline, saying she could only meet in the mornings. “There were times when I would ask her to meet me after work, after 4pm, and she would tell me she couldn’t, and in my heart I used to ask, ‘why not’,” Ellul said. She said she noticed these issues but never asked questions.  Then, in November 2020, Rita went over to her daughter's home and told her that Abina had left her for no reason.  “She called him in front of me and asked him why he left, and he said it was for the best. I then asked him and he told me that they were arguing a lot and he was afraid he would hit her again,” she said.  “My mother sat me down and opened up to me. She told me that that day back in July she had left early because she knew Lawrence was waiting for her at the roundabout in Żebbuġ, and she knew he was following her from Gozo to Malta. She also told me that he had hit her back in September after arriving home late and drunk. “She told me she called the police because she was very upset and that this was not the first time it happened,” Ellul said, holding back tears. She said that after her death, the family went to their mother's Iklin home and found a calendar in the kitchen with the number of Appoġġ services and Dar Merħba Bik, a women’s shelter.  Jessica recalled how she and her sisters never accepted Lawrence, but she tried to accept him out of respect for her mother.   RELATED STORIES  “I did not want to fight with her, and I know in life you don’t always get what you want, so out of respect for my mum, I accepted him,” she said.  Jessica said she and her mother last messaged three days before she was murdered. Ten days before her death, Jessica said her mother called her and she spoke to both her mother and Abina. “I last saw her three weeks before she died, and we had a normal conversation, about our work and that I was considering buying property. It was a normal conversation,” she said.  The jury also heard in more detail about an alleged case of abuse that happened on September 17, 2020.  Then, the police at the Birkirkara police station received a call from Ellul’s cousin, stating that the victim was being beaten up by her partner. The police arrived on the scene and the victim told them that Abina had gone out with her cousin and when he returned, he started hitting her on the head.  Police sergeant Kevin Grima said Abina was in bed pretending to be asleep and when woken up he said Rita was provoking him and he got nervous and slapped her, and she slapped him back and he slapped her once again, and then went to sleep. Ellul was taken to the Mosta health centre for a medical examination and she was referred to Mater Dei Hospital but did not go. From the health centre, Ellul was taken to the Birkirkara police station, where two social workers assessed her.  The social workers, Rachel Farrugia and Ryan Grima, also testified in court on Saturday and gave details on their risk assessment.  To draw this up, they used a tool known as the DASH system- Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification. This identifies the risk of harm.  Farrugia said the risk assessment classified Rita's case as “medium risk” and read out her report.  “Ellul said she was scared that her partner could inflict further damage  and that she was afraid Abina would kill her,” Farrugia said, quoting her notes.  During the interview with the social workers, Rita said that Abina told her on one occasion that “if you do not shut up, I will kill you”. “Ellul alleged that he attempted to strangle her back in March or April 2020,” Farrugia said. She said the risk assessment concluded that there were factors of fear, association of abuse, strangulation, threats to kill, and alcohol abuse.  “She was offered accommodation but refused,” Farrugia said.  A member of the jury asked if there was any follow-up to the report, to which Farrugia said that during the risk assessment, Ellul agreed to be followed up with another social worker, but she said she did not know what happened after that. Mario Xerri, one of the doctors who examined the scene, who also testified on Saturday, said he found it strange that sheets on the side of the bed where the accused claimed to have slept that night were not creased. He also went into detail about how bruises around the victim's neck appeared post-mortem and indicated that Ellul died through strangulation.  The case continues on Monday at 9am.

London police hunt suspect in two 'linked' crossbow attacks,AFP,"London's Metropolitan Police said on Friday that officers were urgently hunting a suspect who injured two people in separate attacks with a crossbow this month in the trendy Shoreditch neighbourhood. The victims - a 44-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man - have both now left hospital after receiving treatment for injuries that the police force said were not life-threatening or life-changing. The incidents, the first on March 4 and the second on Thursday, have been ""linked"" due to ""the nature and location of both"", the Met said. No other similar incidents have been reported, it noted.  ""There are significant efforts to find whoever carried out these assaults, and we are committed to keeping the community updated over the coming days, as we know how worrying this is,"" Detective Chief Superintendent James Conway said. He added his team of detectives and other officers were working to identify witnesses and explore CCTV and forensic ""opportunities"".  Conway appealed for any witnesses to come forward.  In the first assault, on the evening of March 4, the 44-year-old woman was hit in the head as she crossed the road on a residential street in Shoreditch. Ten days later, at a similar time in the evening, the 20-year-old man was left with a neck injury after being struck by a crossbow bolt around 61 metres away on another residential street.

Man accused of dealing in stolen mobile phones remanded in custody,Jessica Arena,"A 34-year-old man was held in preventative custody on Friday after facing accusations of trading in mobile phones he specifically knew were stolen.  Miguel Gaffarena was arraigned in front of Magistrate Abigail Critien and accused of defrauding a phone repair company and having knowingly received and sold stolen goods. He was also charged with recidivism.  The accused told the court he worked as an IT professional and pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution objected to a request for bail, telling the court that Gaffarena had already been denied bail in another case and was currently in preventive custody.  This notwithstanding that civilian witnesses, including the person who had stolen the phones and employees of the company he had sold them to, were yet to testify.  However, the defence countered that the accused’s current state in detention did not preclude him from asking for bail in this case. She said that Gaffarena had a steady job and a fixed address and was willing to submit to the imposition of protection orders to prevent witnesses from the possibility of being intimidated.  “Every crime is serious, but I don’t think that this is a charge that bail cannot be granted for and he is prepared to abide by any conditions that the court sees fit to impose,” the lawyer said. The court ultimately decided to reject bail, citing the protection of witnesses as well as the serious nature of the charges.  The prosecution also requested protection orders for a number of people, including the person who allegedly stole the phone for Gaffarena.  A request was made for that person, who is currently also in detention at the Corradino Correctional Facility, to be housed separately from Gaffarena.  The request was upheld by the court which ordered the prison director to ensure that the two men did not communicate while they were both imprisoned.  Inspector Ian Vella prosecuted.

Accused wanted to stop strangling Rita Ellul but knew she would report him,Jessica Arena,"Murder suspect Lawrence Abina allegedly told police he wanted to stop strangling the victim, but feared jail time if she survived the incident and reported him, a court heard on Friday.  The trial of Lawrence Abina, who is accused of strangling Rita Ellul to death in an Għajnsielem apartment on February 26, 2022, continued with the jury hearing from more parties involved in the investigation.  He is pleading not guilty to the charges.  The court heard from police inspector Wayne Camilleri, who was involved in interrogating the accused on multiple occasions.  Camilleri explained how during a second interrogation, where Abina confessed to police that he had killed Ellul, the accused had put out his hands and made gestures recreating how he had strangled the woman with his thumbs while she lay sleeping in bed.  “He confessed that while he was strangling her, something inside him wanted to stop. In fact, he told us he couldn't look her in the eye and closed his eyes while doing it,” Camilleri said. “He said that something inside him was telling him to stop, but he said that he knew this was a point of no return because if he had stopped and Rita was still alive, she would have reported him to the police and he would have ended up in jail.”  Camilleri testified how he was one of the officers involved in Abina’s initial interrogation, during which he said he was not convinced that Abina was telling the whole truth about his relationship with Ellul.  Camilleri said he confronted the accused with a domestic violence report that Ellul had filed against him in 2020, in which she alleged that it had not been the first time that Abina had physically harmed her.    “According to him, he said that while she had reported him, there was nothing to worry about because she was going to drop the charges. He claimed that he still loved Ellul and had nothing to hide,” Camilleri said.  A day after the initial interrogation, Camilleri said he also took a statement from one of Ellul's close friends - the same woman who was with her in Abina’s apartment the night before the murder.  The woman told him that, for a short time, she had been Ellul and Abina’s landlord when they rented an apartment from her in Marsalforn. She had subsequently struck up a friendship with the victim.  Camilleri said the woman told him she had once heard Ellul and Abina arguing while she was on the phone with the victim and heard the accused hurting her as Ellul called for help.   This incident prompted the woman to ask the couple to move out of her apartment. “She told me she feared that these arguments could escalate, perhaps even to homicide and that’s why she had asked them to move,” he said.  The woman also told Camilleri that things between Ellul and the accused were not going well because she had found out that he was seeing other women and having sex with prostitutes.  In response, Ellul had told Abina that a Maltese man named Stefan was messaging her constantly and asking her to meet, and had even gone to meet him a few times. But, Camilleri continued, Ellul had told her friend that this Stefan character was a work of pure fiction and that she had made him up so that Abina would give her more attention.  Camilleri then went on to describe how a second autopsy had confirmed the cause of death was murder and that, a day after, he received a call telling him that Abina had confessed to Ellul's murder while in police custody.  On March 2, Camilleri described how he was involved in Abina’s second interrogation, during which he confirmed that he had previously confessed his guilt to Inspector Kurt Zahra and that it was he alone who had killed Ellul.  “He told us he had been thinking about killing her from the day before... and when asked why, he said that when Ellul was having fun with her friend and his roommate it was the first time that he had seen her happy in a very long time,” Camilleri said.  “Abina told us that Ellul was unhappy with him and they were arguing constantly. ""She knew he was having affairs and he also mentioned a man named Stefan. He said that Ellul told him about this Maltese man named Stefan whom she was considering leaving him for. Of course, Abina didn’t know that this Stefan didn’t exist. But he said that the main reason he wanted to kill Ellul was because of Stefan.”  In cross-examination, the defence asked whether the police had investigated whether this Stefan person was truly fictitious or not.  Camilleri replied that he had not inquired after this, although he had no information as to whether anybody else had.  “So whether or not this Stefan is real is based on what you heard from Ellul's friend?” he asked, to which the reply was “yes”.  The jury also heard from police inspector Ryan Farrugia, who was tasked with escorting Abina from the police lock-up to an interrogation room.  It just so happened that during this walk, the two men passed from the smoking area, where Deputy Commissioner Sandro Gatt, who was an assistant commissioner at the time, was smoking a cigarette.  Abina, not knowing he was speaking to a high-ranking officer, stopped and asked him for a cigarette.  “I explained to him that the person he had asked for a cigarette was, at the time, an assistant commissioner, but in the meantime, DC Gatt had walked closer to us and was opening the cigarette packet to give him one,” Farrugia said.  “While he was doing that, Gatt asked him how he was feeling and he said that he was feeling sorry for what happened. He started to cry, saying he had grabbed her by the neck and was putting out his arms to show us how. He got down on his knees and was in hysterics.”  Farrugia said he and Gatt kept talking to the accused and trying to calm him down, and after settling him in a chair with some water, Farrugia informed his superiors of what had just transpired.  The case continues on Saturday.  Lawyers Kaylie Bonett, Anthony Vella and Nathaniel Falzon are prosecuting on behalf of the Office of the Attorney General.

Court urges police to consider deporting man jailed for five years over attack,Edwina Brincat,"A court has ordered migration authorities to review the status of a man who was sentenced to five years imprisonment over a violent assault in Marsa in 2021, after noting the accused’s ""alarming"" criminal record.  The Police Commissioner - as Principal Immigration Officer - was to assess whether Khaled Eddali, a 34-year-old Libyan national, “truly deserved” the status he currently enjoyed and to decide whether he should be immediately removed from Malta once he has served his prison term, said Magistrate Monica Vella when handing down judgment on Friday.  From the judgement, it is unclear what status the man enjoys.  Eddali was facing prosecution over a violent incident that took place inside a Marsa garage when he attacked a Syrian man with a metre-long metal bar.  The victim spent days in hospital following the attack during which he was hit on the head, arms and legs.  His mobile phone and some €60 in cash were also allegedly stolen during the assault.  When testifying about the ordeal, the victim recalled that on that Sunday afternoon, he had been sitting outside the garage on Triq is-Serkin which he shared with two other men, when Eddali turned up.  The violence took place inside the garage and the victim later insisted that he had no explanation for the attack, insisting that he never had any previous arguments with the accused.  Eddali was accused of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, aggravated theft, grievously injuring a third party as well as relapsing.  He pleaded not guilty.  When delivering judgment the court declared him guilty of grievously injuring the Syrian man, whilst clearing him of the other charges. His recidivism was also “amply proved.” When meting out punishment the court took note of several factors.  Eddali’s ""not-so-young age"", as well as his unruly criminal record were pointed out by the Magistrate who also observed that the accused had “learnt nothing” from his long spells behind bars.  As “a guest” in the country, rather than take up work and behave properly, the accused constantly caused problems for himself and others.  The court also took note of the grievous injuries suffered by the victim who had since forgiven his aggressor.  The court was duty bound to protect society in general and to send out a message that whoever hurt someone else “must suffer serious consequences,” said Magistrate Vella.  In light of such considerations, the court condemned the accused to a five-year effective jail term less the time spent under preventive custody.  He was also to pay €1,547.27 in court expert expenses within six months and to bind himself not to molest his victim against a personal guarantee of €1000 that was effective for one year.  Finally, the court ordered the Police Commissioner to assess whether the accused’s status in Malta was “truly deserved” and whether he ought to be “immediately” deported after serving punishment.  This was not only in light of today’s conviction but because Eddali’s criminal record was “alarming,” concluded the court.  AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Darlene Grima prosecuted together with Inspector Roderick Attard. The accused was assisted by legal aid lawyers.

Man admits to corrupting minor in incident that was captured on video,Jessica Arena,"A man was remanded in custody on Friday after admitting to charges related to corrupting a minor, in an incident that was captured on video and posted online.  Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed, 35, originally from Somalia, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Abigail Critien, accused of corrupting a minor, engaging in sexual acts in the presence of a minor, harassing the same minor, breaching the public peace and recidivism.  Times of Malta is informed that the incident was captured in a video published by Lovin Malta, in which the accused can be seen in Ġnien il-Mall in Floriana stroking his penis while walking towards the person filming him.  Assisted by an interpreter, the accused told the court that he was currently homeless and unemployed. The defence added that the accused had somewhat fallen through the cracks, as he had not been accommodated anywhere after being released from prison some time ago and remained homeless since then.  Ibrahim Mohamed pleaded guilty to the charges of corrupting a minor and recidivism. He reconfirmed his decision when given time by the court to consider his plea.  The case was deferred to March 25 for judgment.  Inspectors Daryl Borg and Wayne Buhagiar, assisted by AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli prosecuted.  Lawyer Alexia Vassallo was appointed as legal aid for the accused. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Prosecutors offer 30-day delay to landmark Donald Trump hush money trial,AFP,"Prosecutors preparing to put Donald Trump on trial in New York for allegedly covering up hush money payments said they would accept a delay of up to 30 days Thursday after both sides received a deluge of case documents, court filings showed. Trump's side had previously sought a delay to the March 25 start of the criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president. Trump, again the Republican candidate for this year's election, is accused of covering up hush money payments related to his successful 2016 bid for the White House. The former president, in court separately in Florida Thursday as his team sought the dismissal of charges for mishandling classified documents, faces 34 counts of accounting fraud, which include transactions linked to payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. The judge in the records case rejected Trump's attempt to have the case dismissed for ""unconstitutional vagueness,"" and did not rule on a second challenge his team had brought against the prosecution. In the hush money case, prosecutors say Trump illegally covered up remittances to longtime aide Michael Cohen, to reimburse him for payments made to bury stories about Trump's alleged extramarital sexual relations with Daniels and a Playboy model. He denies the charges. A New York grand jury indicted Trump in March 2023 over the payments made to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. ""(Prosecutors) do not oppose a brief adjournment of up to 30 days to permit sufficient time for defendant to review the US Attorney's Office (documents),"" the Manhattan District Attorney said in its submission to the court. ""Yesterday afternoon... the USAO produced approximately 31,000 pages of additional records to both the People and the defense in response to defendant's subpoena, and also indicated that an additional production would follow by next week."" Trump's legal team said on his Truth Social platform that ""this case has no basis in law or fact, and should be dismissed."" Trump has previously described the proceedings as a ""disgrace."" ""It's a rigged state. It's a rigged city. It's a shame,"" he said previously. One expert suggested Trump's legal team were using stalling tactics to delay the trial. ""Trump and his counsel are doing all that they can to prevent any case being tried before the November election,"" said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias. Trump is facing four criminal cases as he campaigns to retake the White House, with his legal teams thus far failing to push the actual trials until after the November 5 vote. Trump, who has seized on his legal woes to rev up his supporters and denounce Democratic opponent Joe Biden, has claimed the charges are ""just a way of hurting me in the election."" Biden and Trump each won enough delegates Tuesday to clinch their party nominations in the 2024 presidential race, all but assuring a rematch and setting up one of the longest election campaigns in US history. The results in four statewide elections Tuesday, the latest in the months-long march to determine the Democratic and Republican party flag bearers, were essentially a foregone conclusion as incumbent Biden and former president Trump had already seen off all primary challengers.

Probed firm Papaya suspected to be secretly owned by Russian national,Jacob Borg,"An investigation is ongoing to establish whether a Russian national concealed his ownership of a licensed financial institution from regulators, in a bid to facilitate money laundering. While the Gżira-based financial institution Papaya is on paper owned by Latvian national Dmitrijs Panurskis, investigators suspect the real owner could be a Russian individual with alleged links to a criminal money-laundering network. Malta was in 2021 greylisted by the FATF, an international financial crime body, in part for its failure to crack down on false company beneficial ownership information in the corporate registry. Investigators want to establish whether the Russian national’s suspected ownership of the MFSA-licensed Papaya was intentionally concealed from regulators, after Panurskis took over as Papaya’s sole shareholder back in 2016. Financial institutions licensed by the MFSA, as well as the people behind them, are subject to strict due diligence and anti-money laundering checks. This is done to prevent bad actors gaining control over them.   A spokesperson for the MFSA declined to comment on specific cases when contacted by Times of Malta about Papaya. The spokesperson acknowledged that instances when ownership information is concealed from the authorities may exist, despite all the measures in place to prevent it. “Such instances are investigated thoroughly with the support of local and international intelligence/law enforcement authorities as well as other local and international regulatory bodies through all the resources available to the authority,” the spokesperson said. Contacted by Times of Malta, Papaya’s listed owner Panurskis denied any wrongdoing. “We have to acknowledge that Papaya has been currently faced with a disinformation attack, characterised by the dispersion of unfounded and defamatory data gathered from unverified and untrustworthy sources, aiming to misguide the financial insti­tution’s clients and partners,” Panurskis said. He said Papaya is determined to initiate a thorough investigation to disclose the culprits behind this disinformation attack, and to counteract them via legal means, along with the assistance of relevant authorities. “We will inform you about the outcomes as the circumstances become clearer. As a regulated financial institution, Papaya manages its business with a high level of transparency. “For any inquiries concerning Papaya’s organisational structure, ownership, or stakeholders, please reach out to the MFSA, which is in charge of the governance of this data and is the sole accurate source of information regarding this matter,” Panurskis said. Papaya features in an international investigation into how a Russian-Eurasian organised crime group allegedly offered money-laundering services to criminals. Sources familiar with the probe say Papaya is suspected to have served as a front for some of these activities. The Russian national suspected to be behind Papaya was one of the targets in a coordinated large-scale operation carried out in February by authorities in Latvia, Germany, France, Italy and Malta. Around 460 police officers in Germany searched 58 residential and business addresses as part of the investigation, with further searches carried out in Latvia. Business documents, mobile phones and other electronic devices were seized during the searches. The Malta offices of Papaya, which was set up in 2012, were also searched as part of the probe. Its former CEO and shareholder Frederic Villa sold his shares in the company to Panurskis in 2016. Sources familiar with the investigation suspect that the Russian national only entered the picture after the shares were transferred. Villa’s lawyer Peter Fenech told Times of Malta that before his client sold the shares to Panurskis, all due diligence was carried out in compliance with applicable Maltese legislation, including fit and proper test by the competent authorities, who exercise ultimate discretion with respect to approval of shareholders on licensed entities. Lawyer Tonio Fenech, a former Papaya director, told Times of Malta that throughout his involvement with Papaya, he never had any indication that the declared owner of the company may have been acting for anybody at all. A spokesperson for the MFSA said that over the past few years, the authority has bolstered the authorisation process for financial institutions, in line with reviews and recommendations by Moneyval and the FATF. “The authorisation process is twofold and is carried out in parallel. One part relates to the analysis of the business model and strategy proposal, and the second part entails a fitness and properness assessment for involved parties in accordance with applicable legislation,” the spokesperson said. The due diligence process is started for all involved parties who are in a position to affect the direction of the applicant, including key functionaries and direct and indirect qualifying shareholders, up to the ultimate beneficial owner. Checks on the applicant’s competence and integrity are carried out with a view to ascertain that the applicant is able to carry out the proposed role within the ambit of proposed business model to an expected high standard, the MFSA said.  RELATED STORIES  The spokesperson said fit and proper checks on licensed individuals are done in close collaboration with local and international regulators, including intelligence reports. “Through its authorisation process, the MFSA complements the assessment of the Malta Business Registry and acts as a second line of defence in the identification and verification of beneficial ownership of persons providing financial services in Malta,” the spokesperson said.

'Former PL canvasser wants to avoid criminal action through Whistleblower Act',Daniel Ellul,"A former PL canvasser who has requested whistleblower status to tell all about the “criminal organisation” linked to the social benefit fraud racket is doing so to avoid criminal procedures, Robert Abela said on Thursday.  “What can be said about this criminal investigation is that Roger Agius has criminal procedures against him,” the prime minister said.  “I understand that one way or another and, through his lawyer, he is seeing how he can obtain immunity from criminal procedures,” Abela said.   He said one of the people who were identified in investigations is trying to get immunity through the Whistleblowers Act. “We should ensure that the police investigation is not neutralised by giving immunity to someone, who in my mind, evidently wants to avoid criminal procedures,” Abela said.  Abela warned against “strategies” that allow people to evade justice.  He said a large number of people have already been charged in court, including several “big fish”. He added that more are to be charged.  “What the police had to investigate, they investigated and they proceeded to take action."" Roger Agius, a former driver and canvasser of junior minister Andy Ellul is set to face numerous charges, including money laundering, for his alleged role in the benefits racket scandal that Times of Malta revealed in September.  Doctor and ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, who signed off on fraudulent medical certificates, is next week expected to be charged with forming part of a criminal organisation, fraud and money laundering. Evidence indicates Grixti provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive social benefits averaging €450 monthly for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. In a judicial protest filed in court on Thursday, Agius claimed that he had been ignored by the Whistleblower Officer within the Prime Minister’s Office when he twice wrote offering to spill the beans on the racket.  The protest was filed against the Prime Minister, the Whistleblower Officer at OPM, the State Advocate, the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner. Agius, a former canvasser for PL junior minister Andy Ellul explained how he had written to the Office of the Prime Minister in November and again in December demanding whistleblower protection because he wanted to “expose corrupt and criminal acts within the public administration”.  However, he was ignored and his detailed emails were not even acknowledged, Agius says. On Thursday evening, Abela said that the Whistleblower Office, that is part of the Prime Minister’s Office, has certain autonomy from the prime minister.  Abela also said that it was his office that initially flagged the benefits racket case to police. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

More than a quarter of women have faced sexual harassment at work,James Cummings,"More than a quarter of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, according to a recent report from the National Statistics Office (NSO). Just over 27% of women said they had faced sexual harassment at work, compared to just 11% of men, according to the Survey on Safety and Well-being 2022. Meanwhile, 26% of women also reported having experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner while just over 25% said they had encountered stalking. Over 3,000 women were surveyed between February and May 2022 alongside just under 2,000 men. The survey was carried out to measure how common gender-based violence is in Malta. The report paints a bleak picture of the female work experience, with one-fifth (20%) of women saying they had experienced inappropriate staring or leering and 17% reporting being subjected to indecent remarks or jokes. One in 10 (10%) women said they had been asked out on a date by a colleague, while 8% said they faced unwanted physical contact. Six per cent said they had faced inappropriate advances on social media or had been sent sexually explicit messages by a colleague. More than six out of 10 (62%) women said they faced sexual harassment from a co-worker, while one-quarter said they had received unwanted attention from their boss. However, the report suggests that the situation could show signs of improving over time, with 57% of women saying the reported incidents of sexual harassment had taken place more than five years before the study was carried out. Twenty-five per cent said the abuse took place between one and five years before, while 17% said it had happened in the previous year.   Despite the report suggesting 47,000 women in the country have experienced sexual harassment at work, this contrasts with how prevalent it is thought to be, with more than half of those surveyed – including both men and women – believing it to be uncommon or not happening at all. Women were more likely to suffer psychological, physical and sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner than their male counterparts, with more than a quarter (26%) of women reporting such incidents versus just less than one in five (19%) men. One in four women said they had experienced psychological violence such as jealous outbursts, intimidation, having their movements tracked or being forbidden from working or seeing friends and family. The most common kind of psychological abuse reported by women was being made to feel belittled or humiliated.   One in five of all people surveyed said they had encountered stalking, equivalent to 25% of women and 16% of men. The most common forms of stalking were repeatedly being sent unwanted messages or gifts, followed by threatening or silent phone calls, being followed or spied on, having pets or possessions damaged and receiving offensive and embarrassing comments in public. More than a quarter of those who suffered stalking said they had changed their behaviour as a result, including changing their contact details, not going out alone or carrying an item for self-defence.   While women were more likely to suffer sexual harassment, violence at the hands of a partner or stalking, men were more likely to suffer violence at the hands of a non-partner such as a stranger or a friend and suffered more physical abuse during childhood. Almost 19% of men said they had experienced at least one incident of violence from someone who wasn’t their partner compared with 15% of women, equivalent to around 39,000 men. The most common age group to encounter such abuse was those between the ages of 18 to 29. Meanwhile, more than a quarter of men (27%) said they had encountered physical or emotional abuse at the hands of a father figure before the age of 15, compared with 19% of women. Both sexes encountered similar levels of abuse at the hands of a mother figure (around 18%). Just over 30% of men said they had been physically or emotionally abused by a parent before the age of 15, five percentage points more than in women. Men and women were exposed to inter-parent abuse at similar levels, with around one in five of both sexes witnessing such behaviour before the age of 15. Just less than one-fifth (18%) of respondents said they had seen their mother be humiliated or belittled by their father, compared to 13% who said they had seen their father be subjected to the same abuse. Overall, 28% of those surveyed said they had experienced physical or emotional abuse at the hands of a parental figure, while 20% said they had witnessed such abuse taking place between their parents. The Survey on Safety and Well-being 2022 was partly funded by the European Union and was undertaken in collaboration with Eurostat and other partners in the European Statistical System. Over 5,000 people between the ages of 18 and 74 were interviewed over the phone or in person for the survey.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man charged with punching tourist after traffic collision,Times of Malta,"A man has been charged with seriously injuring a tourist who pushed him during an argument that ensued after a traffic collision at the beginning of his holiday in Malta. The tourist had only been in Malta for 90 minutes when he was allegedly punched in the left eye by Owen Cremona, 25, from Tarxien, following a collision in Luqa. Police Inspector Paul Camilleri told Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi that the Danish tourist was driving along Triq il-Kunsill tal-Ewropa on March 10 when he was involved in a collision with a car driven by the defendant’s father. The two emerged from their cars and the tourist was said to have pushed the other motorist. That was when Cremona’s girlfriend called her boyfriend to tell him what had happened and he was on site within no time. Upon arrival, the tourist tried pushing Cremona who allegedly retaliated by punching him in the eye, causing him grievous injuries, the court heard. Cremona is pleading not guilty. During submissions, defence counsel Franco Debono noted how the police chose to arraign a suspect using rarely-used urgent summons instead of under arrest in a case where two foreign witnesses had to leave the island in a few days. In such cases, the police usually arraign the suspect under arrest to be able to urgently hear the witnesses, often foreigners, who would be leaving the country. Debono said this was the correct procedure to adopt when the only reason to arraign under arrest was because witnesses were soon leaving the island. He said it was unfair to arraign a person under arrest in such circumstances when the law provided an alternative procedure - that of urgent summons - which reached the same purpose without unnecessarily stifling fundamental freedoms. The case continues. Lawyer Adreana Zammit was also defence counsel.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Former canvasser demands whistleblower protection to tell all on benefits racket,Matthew Xuereb,"Updated 1.52 pm with Repubblika's statement below. A former driver and canvasser for junior minister Andy Ellul has called for a magisterial inquiry into the social benefits racket, saying he is willing to tell all about the “criminal organisation” linked to the scam if given whistleblower protection. In a judicial protest filed in court on Thursday, Roger Agius claimed that he had been ignored by the Whistleblower Officer within the Prime Minister’s Office when he twice wrote offering to spill the beans on the racket, including the people behind it, the modus operandi as well as details on other wrongdoings. The protest was filed against the Prime Minister, the Whistleblower Officer at OPM, the State Advocate, the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner. Agius explained how he had written to the Office of the Prime Minister in November and again in December demanding whistleblower protection because he wanted to “expose corrupt and criminal acts within the public administration”. However, he was ignored and his detailed emails were not even acknowledged. Agius is set to face numerous charges, including money laundering, for his alleged role in the racket Doctor and ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, who signed off on fraudulent medical certificates, is next week expected to be charged with forming part of a criminal organisation, fraud and money laundering. Evidence indicates Grixti provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive social benefits averaging €450 monthly for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. Agius was a former canvasser and driver for Grixti before being roped in to help Ellul for the March 2022 election after Grixti was arrested and forced to resign as a Labour MP in December 2021. Prime Minister Robert Abela co-opted Ellul to parliament to fill Grixti’s seat, and Ellul then went on to successfully contest the doctor’s Żejtun district in the 2022 election. Agius was subsequently given a position-of-trust job within Ellul’s secretariat. Ellul said last year that he was not informed of any alleged abuse by Agius when he was hired. He said Agius resigned as his driver in early 2023.   In his judicial protest, Agius said he had asked for whistleblower protection to expose the modus operandi and the people behind “a high-level criminal organisation operating within the highest echelons of the executive arm of Government” which had the sole aim “to defraud the public coffers of tens of millions of euro, acting with utmost impunity with the help, assistance, encouragement and complicity of a government minister, a parliamentary secretary and several public officers with the aim of the ruling party garnering more votes.” Agius said that under the protection of the Whistleblower Act, he was willing to “disclose not only the ruthless nature of the criminal conspiracy operating from within the Ministry of Social Policy after 2019, but also reveal the corrupt practices which took place for vote buying.” Apart from his suspected role in introducing people into the benefits racket, Agius is also suspected to have falsely claimed to suffer from a severe disability, which should have seen him surrender his driver’s licence. In his letter sent to OPM by his legal consultants, Agius said he was in a position to show how the system worked in the case of these fraudulent applications, the way it was done, the bribery between those involved, which in certain cases amounted to hundreds of euros per person, and how a senior government official and member of the state executive directed him not to report to work and focus exclusively on constituency work in connection with the Labour Party. The same legal advisers had informed the Whistleblower Officer within the Office of the Prime Minister that Agius was ready to testify all this under oath before an inquiring magistrate. Agius said he also informed the police Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) on his willingness to confirm his version under oath. During an interrogation held in the FCID building last month, Agius said he had given the police information about another racket that involved members of the police force and abuse of sickness benefits where the 'sick' would report for work every Sunday but then take sick leave from Monday to Saturday. No one from the police has spoken to him about this abuse so far, despite his promise to furnish more details. Agius also expressed concern that someone from within the top echelons of the police had informed a cabinet minister about his interrogation. He said he believed the source of the leak was not the inspector himself but someone else “much higher up in the hierarchy of the police force”. Agius said that towards the end of last year, there were several attempts urging him to replace his lawyers with a lawyer engaged by the government. He insisted that he was not for sale. He said both the police and the Prime Minister's Office “deliberately ignored” his request for whistleblower status to spill the beans on “one of the biggest scandals of corruption, maladministration, bribery and concealment of incriminating evidence…coordinated and planned and which eventually began to take place in and from within the highest corridors of power.” He therefore called for the opening of a magisterial inquiry so he could testify all he knew about this and other rackets under oath and held the authorities responsible for damages he was suffering in default. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta signed the protest. In a reaction to the judicial protest, rule of law group Repubblika said Malta needs a whistleblower law that works. It condemned the way how an application by a potential whistleblower was ignored by the responsible officials within the government.   ""The fight against corruption merits an effective law to protect whistleblowers. The current one does not,"" the group said.   It insisted that the application of the whistleblower protection law must not rest on officials dependent on the government, because such officials protected ministers instead of witnesses.

E-tagging could be an option for potential victims: Home Affairs Minister,Sarah Carabott,"The government will be proposing allowing potential crime victims to wear an e-tag, Byron Camilleri told Parliament on Wednesday. The Home Affairs Minister said that following the government's tabling of a bill on the e-tagging of perpetrators of crime, stakeholders had suggested providing the service to potential victims as well. The government will, therefore, propose an amendment to the current bill to allow for voluntary tagging of victims. He said the tendering process for the provision of the service was meanwhile being finalised. The minister said the government will also be providing wearable panic alarms for victims of domestic violence. “If someone presses the panic alarm, it would be as if they called 112, and emergency services will know the live location of the person who pressed the button.""  RELATED STORIES  Camilleri was answering questions by independent MP Rosianne Cutajar. First presented to Parliament two years ago, the so-called 'Electric Monitoring Bill' was moved again for first reading in October 2022.  RELATED STORIES  Electronic tagging will be provided for people sentenced to a prison term of not more than one year as well as in cases where a restraining order is imposed, or when a court issues a temporary protection order in domestic violence cases.  According to the bill, electronic tags can also be used on prisoners who are granted prison leave, and those allowed out on parole.  The bill does not apply to those who are out on police bail for serious crimes, despite calls from legal professionals including Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera.  The issue returned to the spotlight recently in August when Jomic Calleja Maatouk fled Malta with his wife while he was out on bail after appealing his conviction for importing explosives. The couple remain on the run.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Pickpockets who stole tourists’ bank cards jailed,Times of Malta,"Two pickpockets who stole tourists’ bank cards as they toured the narrow streets of Rabat were jailed on Wednesday after they pleaded guilty to committing the crime. Andrei Nistor, 51, and 38-year-old Lucian Serban, both from Romania, appeared in court charged with stealing bank cards belonging to two tourists in Rabat earlier this month. Nistor alone was also charged with relapsing. The two men pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him. Prosecuting police inspector Godwin Scerri told Magistrate Charmaine Galea that the defendants had stolen around €200 in cash as well as bank cards. In their submissions on punishment, defence lawyers Lennox Vella and Mark Mifsud Cutajar told the court that the men would be returning the stolen money. But the magistrate warned that the men could not escape punishment – an effective prison term - simply because they pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity or because of their commitment to return the money they had stolen. “We cannot allow thieves to avoid prison time simply because they returned what they had stolen,” the magistrate insisted.   Serban was sentenced to imprisonment for three months. Given his recidivism, Nistor was jailed for six months. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Car dealer charged with assaulting client,Times of Malta,"A car dealer was on Wednesday charged with assaulting a client who was angry at him for selling a defective car part. Bernard Attard, 32, from Żebbuġ, was charged with assaulting a man who turned up outside his house allegedly armed with pepper spray. Before Magistrate Charmaine Galea, Attard pleaded not guilty to slightly injuring the victim, causing over €250 worth of damage to his property, breaching the peace and breaching the bail conditions over a separate case as well the conditions of a suspended sentence. Inspector John Sammut told the court that the victim had gone outside Attard’s residence with pepper spray demanding to speak to him over a defective car part he had sold him. The inspector said that after spraying pepper spray at Attard’s father, who had opened the front door, Attard emerged with a metal rod with which he assaulted the alleged victim and damaged his car. The court was told that the police would also charge the alleged victim over the same incident. Attard pleaded not guilty. His defence lawyer requested bail but the prosecution objected, saying he was currently on bail over a different case and had opted to confront the alleged victim with a metal rod rather than calling the police to intervene. Magistrate Galea upheld the request for bail against a €2,000 deposit and a €4,000 personal guarantee. She also ordered him to sign the bail book twice a week and issued a protection order in favour of the alleged victim. Lawyers José Herrera, Matthew Xuereb and Alexander Scerri Herrera were defence counsel. Attard, who is also separately facing money laundering charges, was mentioned in court last week after a laptop exhibited as evidence in the case against him went missing from court. This emerged during the compilation of evidence against two women – Jessica Sciberras Azzopardi and Maria Attard – who stand charged with aiding and abetting money laundering. The crucial piece of evidence was exhibited in January 2022 by the Financial Crimes Investigations Department in the case against Attard, who stands charged with misappropriating €1.2 million, fraud and money laundering.

French fake Rolex ‘prince’ trial sheds light on elaborate fraud,AFP,"The trial of a Frenchman accused of making millions selling fake luxury watches is putting the spotlight on an elaborate commerce of lucrative replicas spanning the globe. Nicknamed “the prince of fake”, Julien V. has freely admitted to running a network of fake watch sales into France from Thailand between 2019 and 2022, before being arrested. He told investigators that contractors in China produced up to 10 watches per day for him – most of them fakes of luxury Swiss brand Rolex – resulting in total sales of 12,000 watches for a turnover of three million euros ($3.3 million). However, a watch expert quoted in the Nice-Matin newspaper, Michel Vittini, said he believed Julien V. sold “at least 50,000” fake Rolexes. Some of them appear to have been virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, with Julien V. claiming that he could “make it completely real, or completely fake” depending on “what makes the customer happy”. A credible China-made Rolex replica was priced at 500 euros, rising to 1,300 euros if it also had the double of a genuine serial number engraved, he said. For 6,500 euros the watch had an original automatic mechanism, and a custom-made timepiece made of entirely genuine parts could go up to 60,000 euros. Real Rolexes cost from around 5,000 euros to upwards of 70,000 euros and keep or increase their value in the second-hand market. The high-quality fakes attracted the attention of Swiss watchmakers who hired private investigators, according to French media. Investigators closed in on Julien V. after arresting some of his online resellers. On trial since last week, he has taken charge of his own defence at the trial where he faces an army of lawyers for half a dozen of Swiss luxury watchmakers who have brought a civil case against him. Julien V., born in the French Riviera city of Nice in 1994 and a former pizza delivery man, said that he was a millionaire by the time he was 25, had 4 million euros stashed away in crypto-currency bitcoin and owned a Lamborghini as well as several properties in Thailand. Accepting orders via WhatsApp, he would ship the watches first to Germany to avoid attracting the attention of French customs, and then into France through the open border between both countries. One of his co-defendants, reseller Florian R., said that he would buy fake Rolexes for 200 euros and sell them on for 400. Asked by the presiding judge why he didn’t charge more, Florian R. said: “These are fakes, I don’t cheat people.” The verdict in the trial is due on March 20.

Man charged with stabbing his step-daughters in vicious Marsa attack,Jessica Arena,"A 43-year-old man was charged with the attempted murder of his two step-daughters on Tuesday. Nazzareno Dalli, known as Ronald, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo to face charges after he allegedly stabbed the 12 and 15-year-old girls in a home in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on Saturday. He was also charged with attacking the girls, causing them grievous bodily harm and holding them against their will. Dalli was also accused of carrying a sharp and pointed object without a license, drug possession, illegally working as a private guard and recidivism. In a terse court sitting, Dalli pleaded not guilty to the charges. He did not request bail. The 12-year-old child he is alleged to have attacked suffered multiple stab wounds and was critically wounded. The other, aged 15, was injured on her hands. A 14-year-old boy who was also present at the time was not injured but was later treated for shock.  Sources said the mother was not at home at the time.  The suspect fled from the scene before police arrived but was apprehended shortly afterwards in Cospicua. It is unclear whether Dalli and the woman were still in a relationship at the time of the attack.  Dalli was originally due to be arraigned on Monday but prosecutors had to postpone the court hearing after the accused complained of chest pains and was taken to Mater Dei Hospital.  The Cospicua man is known to police: in 2020 he and his five brothers all ended up in court following a major brawl between two families.  Attorney General lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech led the prosecution, together with Police Inspectors Ian Vella and Wayne Camilleri.  Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Nicholas Mifsud and Franco Debono appeared for Dalli.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Cleaner jailed for stealing €5,000 worth of jewellery from her employer ",Jessica Arena,"A cleaner who stole €5,000 worth of jewellery from the family she worked for was condemned to a 20-month effective jail term after admitting to the theft in court on Tuesday.  Graziella Debono, 47, of Paola, was charged with aggravated theft and recidivism, with her employers saying that on the last days of her employment, she left with several valuables from their house.  One of the victims testified that she had been looking up Facebook for someone to clean her house and the accused was one of several who had popped up. She hired her to clean her house once a week on Fridays.  On occasions, no one was in the house while she was cleaning. Debono, the victim said, typically went to the house with nothing but her mobile phone and her purse. They had suspected nothing until they opened a seldom-used drawer and found several pieces of family jewellery missing.  It was after that discovery that the victim recalled that on the last three occasions that she had gone to their house, Debono had been uncharacteristically carrying a handbag.  After becoming suspicious she asked Debono to call on a Saturday instead of a Friday, so she would be able to watch over her. Debono replied that she had fallen from a three-storey height and injured her leg and would no longer be able to attend to the job.  A police investigation later revealed that Debono had sold the stolen items to a jeweller for €1,135. They were valued by a court expert at €5,000. The court considered the fact that the accused had in 2021 already been condemned to a six-month jail term as well as a fine for similar charges and that despite being given several opportunities, she had made no attempt to pay back what she owed to the victims.  “The court feels that the accused can offer no assurances of paying back the parte civile if she had to be given a sentence that does not include incarceration,” Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit said in her judgment.  “Throughout these procedures, which have been ongoing for some time, she has had ample time to pay them back, but she has not even tried, instead coming up with one excuse after another to paint herself as the victim!”.  Considering her “colourful” criminal record as well as her own admission, the court found Debono guilty of all the charges and sentenced her to a 20-month jail term. She was given a year to pay back her victims €5,000. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Marsa girl suffered 'multiple' stab wounds, mother's partner to be charged",Times of Malta,"A 43-year-old man from Cospicua is expected to be charged with the attempted murder of two girls, aged 12 and 15, in a knife attack on Saturday afternoon. The man, who is believed to be in a relationship with the mother of the children, was due to be arraigned on Monday at 5pm before duty magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace. But police sources said he was temporarily hospitalised after he complained of chest pains. He is expected to be charged on Tuesday. The incident happened on Saturday at around 1.30 pm in Triq San Tumas, Marsa.   Investigations have revealed that a man had been arguing with the two girls, as well as with a 14-year-old boy, in their Marsa home.  The argument boiled over and he brandished a knife at the teens. Both girls were seriously injured, with the 12-year-old in critical condition after suffering 17 stab wounds, according to TVM. A police source independently confirmed that the victim suffered ""multiple stab wounds"". The 15-year-old suffered stab wounds to her hands. Sources said the mother was not at home at the time. The 14-year-old boy was not injured but was treated for severe shock. The suspect fled from the scene before police arrived but was apprehended shortly afterwards in Cospicua.

Andy Ellul’s former aide to be charged over benefits fraud,Jacob Borg,"A former driver and canvasser for junior minister Andy Ellul is set to be charged with forming part of a “criminal organisation” linked to the social benefits racket. Roger Agius is set to face a raft of charges, including money laundering, for his alleged role in the racket. Doctor and ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, who signed off on fraudulent medical certificates, will also be charged with forming part of a criminal organisation, fraud and money laundering. Evidence indicates Grixti provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive social benefits averaging €450 monthly for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. Agius was a former canvasser and driver for Grixti before being roped in to help Ellul for the March 2022 election. The switch came after Grixti was arrested and forced to resign as a Labour MP in December 2021. Prime Minister Robert Abela co-opted Ellul into parliament to fill Grixti’s seat, and Ellul then went on to contest the doctor’s Żejtun district in the 2022 election. Agius was subsequently given a position-of-trust job within Ellul’s secretariat. Ellul said last year that he was not informed of any alleged abuse by Agius at the time he was hired. He said Agius resigned as his driver in early 2023. Apart from his suspected role in introducing people into the benefits racket, Agius is also suspected to have falsely claimed to suffer from a severe disability, which should have seen him surrender his driver’s licence.  RELATED STORIES  Times of Malta last year interviewed three benefits recipients, including a man who said a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the benefits fraud racket in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. An internal inquiry by the social policy ministry into how disability benefits are awarded was opened in September, following Times of Malta’s revelations. Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon told parliament in January that the inquiry board had requested an extension “of a few weeks” to conclude its report. The prime minister had never publicly disclosed the reason behind Grixti’s forced resignation. He claims the racket was first flagged to the police by the Office of the Prime Minister back in 2021. This has led the opposition to question why an inquiry was only set up in September 2023. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Terrorism investigation leads to human smuggling arraignment,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who was arrested by the police on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities has been charged in court with trying to help someone enter Malta illegally. Magistrate Noel Bartolo heard police inspector Zachary Zammit explain how Syrian national Bashar Mohamad, 29, of Qormi, was arrested at the end of last month after the police received a tipoff about his potential involvement in terrorism. The tip-off initially did not yield results and the man was released on police bail while the investigations continued. The inspector said Mohamad was then found in possession of two Maltese passports which he was planning to use when flying out of Malta to Germany. Only one of them was his and the other belonged to a relative. He said investigators believed that the accused was planning to sell the second passport to someone else while abroad so that it could be used for somebody to enter Malta illegally. Mohamad was charged with trying to smuggle persons into Malta, assisting them to enter Malta illegally and stealing the second passport found in his possession. He pleaded not guilty. Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit requested bail, insisting that the police had granted their client police bail while they were carrying out their investigations. Mohamad respected the police bail conditions and turned up at the police depot whenever they asked him to. The prosecution, however, objected to the request, explaining that while the accused was out on police bail, he had spoken to the owner of the passport at the centre of this case, who was a relative. In view of this, Magistrate Bartolo refused the request because of the possibility of tampering with evidence and the man was remanded in custody.

Four teenagers charged with mugging cab drivers,Matthew Xuereb,"Four teenagers, aged between 14 and 17, were on Saturday charged with their involvement in a series of muggings of cab drivers. Two 14-year-old boys from Marsascala and Cospicua, a 16-year-old from Żabbar and a 17-year-old from Senglea were charged with four muggings that took place last week. The first one took place on March 5 in Żabbar when an Uber driver was mugged. The robbers made off with cash and other items with a total value of between €200 and €2,300.

Businessman fighting extradition to Sweden over VAT fraud granted bail,Jessica Arena,"A Maltese businessman who is wanted in Sweden as part of a Europe-wide investigation into VAT fraud was granted bail on Thursday after his wife and three children stepped in as third-party guarantors. Mohan Bharwani, 57, from Sliema, has spent the past week in custody after he was arrested on the back of a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish authorities as part of an investigation into a €195 million VAT fraud case. According to Europol, Bharwani and 14 others are believed to have orchestrated the fraud across 17 countries. Their arrests were the result of an investigation by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), with over 180 searches carried out simultaneously in Albania, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK. A bail application filed by Bharwani’s lawyers was accepted by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, with a hefty sum attached to his freedom. He was ordered to pay a €40,000 deposit with a personal guarantee of €60,000. An additional pledge of €25,000 was required from his wife and three children, two of whom are understood to be students. Bharwani was also ordered to attend all court sittings, not to travel or approach the coast or the airport, sign the bail book twice a day and observe a curfew between 8pm and 6.30am. Lawyers Stefano Filletti, Giannella de Marco and Maurice Meli appeared for Bharwani. In a statement, Europol previously said the searches carried out yielded vast quantities of smartphones, worth more than €15.3 million, as well as a yacht worth €3 million, and €1.2 million in cash and cryptocurrency. Luxury cars including a Rolls Royce, a BMW and a Range Rover as well as a number of luxury watches and 2.5 kilos of gold were also seized from the homes of the suspects. It is understood that the VAT fraud scheme operated through a complex ecosystem of several criminal schemes involving the sale of small electronic devices like smartphones. The suspects are believed to have made use of chains of missing traders, who would vanish without making good on their tax obligations. Over 180 searches were carried out simultaneously in Albania, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK. Bharwani was arrested last week, while the police were searching his property in San Ġwann. Europol said the investigation revealed that the suspected organisers of the VAT fraud scheme created a complex criminal ecosystem, which allowed them to defraud up to €195 million through several criminal schemes involving the sale of small electronic devices, such as smartphones. It is understood that the suspects used fraudulent chains of missing traders, who would vanish without fulfilling their tax obligations. In 2020, the same organisers of these VAT fraud schemes are believed to have entered the market for protective face masks. The company managed by the suspects is understood to have bought them from a missing trader, and channeled them through several buffer companies to disguise their final destination. On paper, their company was based in Hong Kong, but the face masks were actually in a warehouse in Germany, and remained there until the German Federal Ministry of Health purchased them from the company ostensibly based in Hong Kong.

Judge raps police investigation and overturns conviction for mugging,Jessica Arena,"A 24-year-old man who had been sentenced to a 30-month prison term for a snatch-and-grab theft had his conviction overturned on Thursday after a judge ruled that CCTV footage presented as evidence clearly did not actually show him.  Ilajsu Seidu had been convicted of snatching a €2000 gold necklace from an 81-year-old woman in September 2022, while she was walking with her husband in Marsa.  The woman had described the thief as having been wearing a dark-coloured baseball cap, surgical mask, hoodie, and sweatpants. The police had claimed that CCTV footage showed the accused running towards the pedestrian bridge on the Marsa - Hamrun bypass and crossing it. Subsequent footage then showed the suspect running in the direction of Qormi.  Seidu was found guilty and sentenced to two and a half years in jail.  His lawyers Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud argued in his appeal that the prosecution hadn’t satisfactorily proven that Seidu was in fact the person who committed the theft and that other eyewitnesses were not brought in to testify and confirm his identity, including the victim’s husband, who was with her at the time of the crime.  Instead, the police had chosen to rely on CCTV which had not even captured the incident itself.  Police had questioned Seidu’s ex-girlfriend who had pointed out that he had been arrested in a drugs raid in Marsa a few days earlier and was still in custody.  While she did identify Seidu in a still image shown to her by the police, when asked to confirm this on the witness stand, the woman told the court that she had been smoking crack cocaine before the questioning and had been in a state of paranoia.  She recalled telling police that it was Seidu but later said that this was not true.  Judge Consuelo Scerri Herrera observed in her judgement that evidence in general was “very scarce” and proper identification of who had actually committed this crime had not taken place. The police had concluded it was Seidu only through the ex-grilfriend’s testimony which was then not corroborated on the witness stand.  An examination of the photo shown to the ex-girlfriend revealed that this could not be Seidu, the judge said.  “It is evident from the examination carried out by the court itself that the accused is NOT the person shown in the picture. His colouring is less dark than that shown on the male in the picture. Also, his facial features are different. The court cannot feel serene in deciding that the picture is a photo of the accused,” she said.  The prosecution could have done more to positively identify the accused, the judge said. Given the age of the victim, she should not have had to wait five months before being asked to give her account of the incident to the police, the judge added.  This was on top of the fact that despite being present, the woman’s husband had never been called to testify.  The judge ultimately ruled that the court could not satisfactorily conclude that Seidu had indeed been the person to commit the crime.  Lawyers Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud assisted Seidu.

Rabat murder: Police were warned about the accused's gun ownership 12 years ago,Matthew Xuereb,"Police were warned by a psychiatrist 12 years ago that a man who allegedly committed a murder on January 1 this year, should not be in possession of firearms because of his mental condition. The shocking detail emerged from a report filed on Wednesday by court-appointed psychiatrist Joseph Cassar who found a note in Noel Azzopardi’s medical file at Mount Carmel Hospital where he had voluntarily admitted himself for psychiatric treatment. Azzopardi, 39, is pleading not guilty to murdering Eric Borg, firing a gun within 200 metres of an urban area and not ensuring that his gun and ammunition were kept in a secure place inside his home. Cassar testified during the compilation of evidence that he had been appointed by the magistrate presiding over the magisterial inquiry to ascertain whether Azzopardi was fit for interrogation. He had concluded that the accused understood what he was being charged with, the implications of his actions and the punishment he could face if found guilty of the crime. Cassar said that during the examination, Azzopardi told him how he had a history of mental illness and that he had previously been treated at Mount Carmel Hospital where he was administered medication. He said that since Azzopardi was probably paranoid and had a cognitive deficit, he recommended that he be subjected to a neuro-psychological examination to ascertain whether he had any other disorder such as autism. He also suggested that the family should be involved in this process because the examiner would need to look into his developmental history before reaching a conclusion. Cassar said Azzopardi signed himself into Mount Carmel on July 5, 2012, because of impulsive and erratic behaviour. Although he was not aggressive to other patients during his stay there, staff observed a somewhat heated argument with his sister where he was blaming her for his situation. Cassar said he found a note in Azzopardi’s medical file at Mount Carmel, about a discussion between staff members on Azzopardi’s possession of shotguns. The staff concluded that this was a public danger, and psychiatrist David Mamo on July 18, 2012, wrote to the Rabat Police Station expressing his concern that Azzopardi had three shotguns in his possession. He wrote that he felt duty-bound to bring this to the attention of the police and that since Azzopardi had mental health issues, he believed that his possession of firearms was a danger to the public. During a search following the murder, the police found nine shotguns at his house: six were registered in his name and another three in his father’s. The shotgun allegedly used in the murder was hidden behind a grandfather clock. Cassar said that Azzopardi had been released from Mount Carmel Hospital at the end of July 2012 and continued to call at the hospital regularly as an outpatient and was subsequently followed once a year. Until 2016, he was still waiting for his firearms licence, according to the medical file.   During the same court sitting, prosecuting investigator Godwin Agius explained how Azzopardi told officers that he knew murder victim Eric Borg by sight as they owned fields close to one another in Buskett and that the two had exchanged words that day. The inspector said he never mentioned Borg by name. Azzopardi did not give officers a detailed account of what the two men discussed, but said that he saw red after Borg told him “don’t stick your nose in other people’s affairs, you’ll regret it.” [tindaħalx f’affarijiet ta’ ħaddieħor, inpattihielek]. He told him how he got into his car and drove after Borg, who parked on Triq il-Fidloqqom in Rabat, where he lived. Azzopardi then got out of his vehicle with his shotgun, shot Borg once in the back and then again as he lay on the ground to ensure he wouldn’t get up, Azzopardi told interrogators, that he did so because he was enraged by what Borg had told him. He told the police he felt offended by what he had told him. The inspector said that an autopsy carried out on Borg’s corpse the day after the murder revealed that he had died due to gunshot wounds that perforated his right atrium in his heart as well as his right lung. Asked about issues revolving land ownership, Azzopardi did not offer the police any explanation and he did not say if there were any issues between the two. The case before Magistrate Marseann Farrugia continues in April. The prosecution was led by Inspector Wayne Camilleri, Inspector Scerri and Attorney General lawyer Darlene Grima. Lawyers Alex Miruzzi, Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri represented the defendant. Lawyers Joe Giglio and Michaela Giglio represented the victim’s family.

Judge orders police investigation into Yorgen Fenech leaks,Matthew Xuereb,"A judge has ordered a police investigation into how the latest bail application filed by alleged murder mastermind Yorgen Fenech was leaked to the media soon after it was filed in court. Madam Justice Edwina Grima ordered the investigation upon a complaint by Fenech’s lawyers, Charles Mercieca and Gianluca Caruana Curran, who raised the matter during a hearing on Wednesday. Mercieca was making submissions during a pre-trial hearing. Fenech is awaiting trial for allegedly masterminding the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017. Mercieca said the defence team was startled when it learnt that the bail application it had just filed was soon after published online, before the defence had the opportunity to make oral submissions in court. He demanded that action be taken about the leak, insisting that this was not the first time that this had happened. Madam Justice Grima upheld the request and ordered the Police Commissioner to initiate an investigation into the leak and inform the court about how the media was getting information about acts exhibited in the case, especially since only the parties to the case were privy to such applications. Mercieca reminded the court that in 2021, the court had ordered the prosecution of persons who had leaked evidence from a compilation of evidence. The lawyer drew parallels with “the same modus operandi” used in Slovakia, a reference to the acquittal of a businessman charged with his involvement in the assassination of Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend. He pointed out that in that case, the Slovak state had been found to have been responsible for the leaking of evidence to the media. To this end, the judge also ordered the police to investigate and prosecute anyone who had breached her previous order prohibiting the publication of evidence and documents from the criminal case. During the same sitting, Mercieca argued that it did not make sense that the Attorney General was still using the same argument of 2019 to continue objecting to his client being granted bail. “That was 2019 and now we’re in 2024 and the arguments have not changed,” he complained. He said that when legislators had introduced a 20-month limit on compilations of evidence, the intention was for defendants not to spend more than that time in preventive custody. In this case, the Attorney General circumvented this and issued a bill of indictment just 40 days before this period was up. “Had the AG not issued the bill of indictment in the manner she did, Fenech would be on bail right now,” Mercieca said. Prosecutor Anthony Vella, representing the Office of the Attorney General, said the prosecution’s argument in objecting to bail had been a consistent one and based on Fenech’s previous attempt to abscond when he became aware that the investigations were zooming in on him. Now that his trial is so close, that risk was much greater, he added. He referred to Fenech’s chats with his uncle Ray in 2019, in which they had explored the possibility of leaving Malta by air, making inquiries about flights and speaking to a private jet pilot, but later decided that it would be better to escape by sea. Fenech had connections with people involved in criminal organisations, he added, leading to objections from the defence team. Besides the risk of Fenech absconding, there was also the risk that he would attempt to tamper with evidence, Vella added. He also mentioned that Fenech had filed a request for a presidential pardon, which he said was an indication of involvement.  Mercieca retorted that there was complete silence from the prosecution on third parties being mentioned in connection with this case, and who were currently not in custody. He insisted that his client was still presumed innocent and that other people mentioned in this case, such as Keith Schembri and Chris Cardona were still free. Earlier in the sitting, during submissions on the reduction of the freezing order imposed on Fenech, Madam Justice Grima criticised the new law passed by parliament recently that caps a freezing order on the amount believed to have been made illegally. The judge said this law had too many loopholes and that members of the judiciary were at a loss on how to apply it, especially on pending cases. “How can I decide on limiting a freezing order unless I hear and decide on the merits of the case? This does not make any sense,” she remarked.   She adjourned the case to Friday and said that a decree on the bail request would be delivered in chambers. -- You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

'Exhausted' family of Pelin Kaya say they hope her killer dies behind bars,Giulia Magri,"The family of Pelin Kaya have said they hope her killer dies behind bars as he begins a 40-year sentence for murder. Jeremie Camilleri, 34, was sentenced on Tuesday after he admitted deliberately mowing down the 30-year-old interior designer in his BMW as she walked home from celebrating her birthday on January 18th, 2023. Her sister, Derya Kaya said the judicial process could not bring back Pelin but that the family were ""exhausted"" and now needed to grieve. “Now my prayer, and that of my family is that he will die in prison. We will never hug or hold Pelin again, but he will continue to breathe,” she said.  Derya said that while she could not understand the court ruling, delivered in Maltese, she could tell from Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera’s face that she was unhappy. On handing down the judgment, Scerri Herrera said that in these serious circumstances, she believed that the punishment should be higher but that she could not jail him for life because he admitted guilt before the bill of indictment was issued.  Camilleri admitted murder last month after a plea agreement with all parties, including the victim's family. Derya said she fears that once Camilleri is out of prison, he will hurt more people.  “It is the same situation in our country I know. But the Maltese people will continue to feed him in prison through their taxes, while we will never see Pelin again,” she said.  Carrying a ring with a portrait of Pelin and her initials engraved on it as well as a necklace with a lock of her sister's hair, Derya said she felt her sister was ""always with me"".    “I hope she (Pelin) is happy where she is. She is always with me, and I am sure she can feel that I am exhausted.”  RELATED STORIES  Pelin's uncle Aykan Ceylan also spoke to Times of Malta outside court.   “Nothing will bring Pelin back,” he said. “Today is the end of the process, and while she will never come back, this sentence makes our souls and hearts lighter,"" he added. Pelin’s mother Çiçek Kaya, her older sisters, including Derya, her uncle, aunts, and friends were present for the sentencing hearing. Afterwards, the family wept and embraced each other outside the Valletta law court. Standing by his son-in-law, Hasan Ulusoy, who translated, Aykan said the family was not looking for revenge but just wanted justice.  “We have been to Malta many times, and each time was very difficult and painful,” he said.  “Pelin’s parents are not okay. We, the relatives, are trying our best to be okay, to be strong for her parents. We know nothing will bring Pelin back, but the end of this process makes our feelings a bit better, our souls and hearts a bit lighter.” He said the next step is to continue supporting the family.  “We will be there to help them grieve and heal.” He said the family were grateful for the Maltese community, the Turkish Embassy, their lawyers, and the journalists who supported them. “It was the power of the community’s support that kept us going, so thank you.”  RELATED STORIES  A Women's Day reception will be held at the Turkish Embassy in memory of Pelin later on Tuesday. European President Roberta Metsola was one of the first to react to Camilleri’s sentence.  “Justice would mean Pelin Kaya being with us today,” she wrote.    “Today, as the news focuses on her killer and his sentence, please remember her.” The court previously heard that Pelin and Camilleri were not known to each other and had never met before the attack.  Camilleri later told the police that he “wanted to be famous” and that he was “a psychopath and proud”.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Man ‘heard a voice in his head’ as he stabbed brother-in-law 13 times,Times of Malta,"A man accused of stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept told police during his interrogation that he had heard a voice in his head, the court heard. Police Inspector Keith Rizzo said that 63-year-old Robert Frendo from Paola told police the voice in his head urged him to do it. Frendo stands charged with stabbing his brother-in-law, Joseph Seychell, in the house where they both lived, on February 20. Inspector Keith Rizzo told the court he had responded to a request for assistance in Triq Lampuka in Paola, where he found an ambulance on site and a doctor treating the alleged victim. Seychell told the inspector that Frendo had stabbed him multiple times in his sleep. Frendo was also charged with causing grievous injuries to Seychell and causing him to fear violence as well as carrying a weapon. Rizzo told Magistrate Marseanne Farrugia that Seychell told him he was asleep when, all of a sudden, he felt pain to his heart and when he woke up he found Frendo stabbing him. He said he was stabbed around 13 times. The police had received previous reports involving the men, he added, but the victim’s wife and defendant’s brother told police that there had never been problems between the two. She also told officers that Frendo was schizophrenic and had an alcohol problem. Rizzo said that large amounts of blood were observed on the sofa where the victim had been asleep and in other parts of the house. The inspector said the defendant was declared fit for interrogation and this happened in the presence of a lawyer. During the questioning, Frendo had admitted to stabbing the man, going on to tell the police that he intended to kill him. “He said that he had been drunk at the time and had heard an internal voice saying ‘get him, get him, get him’...So he started to stab him,” said the inspector. Waking up after being stabbed the first time, the victim had asked his attacker why he was doing this, to which the defendant replied “First, I’m going to kill you and then I’m going to kill your wife.” At the end of the sitting, the court decreed that it had sufficient evidence for the case against the accused to go ahead. The case was adjourned to April. Police inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo, are prosecuting, assisted by prosecutors Ramon Bonett Sladden and Nathaniel Falzon from the Office of the Attorney General. Lawyer Wilfrid Buttigieg assisted the defendant. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit are appearing for the victim as parte civile.

‘I’m the victim’: Carmelo Abela on involvement in HSBC heist,Giulia Magri,"Carmelo Abela insisted he was “the victim” when questioned why two convicted murderers claimed under oath that he was involved in the 2010 failed HSBC attempted robbery.  The Labour MP was one of two Labour politicians named by hitmen George and Alfred Degiorgio on Thursday, when they testified in libel proceedings Abela filed against former Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi.  In a joint declaration, the brothers, serving 40-year sentences for their role in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, said Abela and former economy minister Chris Cardona “gave instructions on the HSBC heist”. On the same day, Abela said he “absolutely and categorically” denies any involvement in the robbery. “When you see what they said in court, they do not say how I was involved, they say nothing, and that is an indication as to why they say this,” Abela told radio show host Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103.  “They do not want any form of justice, but are alleging that they know something, but provide no information,” the government backbencher said.   When asked why the Degiorgios would mention him, Abela said he would like to know the reason why.  “I was an employee of the bank, I was a member of the cabinet, I was deputy speaker also,” he said. When asked if Abela spoke to the prime minister as to why he was not chosen to be a member of cabinet after the 2022 elections, he said he respects the Robert Abela's decisions.  Jason Azzopardi said that according to blogger Mark Camilleri, Abela sent  footage of the interior of the bank building to the Degiorgio brothers. Abela hit back, saying if Camilleri has any evidence of that he should provide it to the police.  “In my conscience, I feel at peace, because all these allegations, wherever they are coming from, I have nothing to hide,” he told the video interviewer.  In a post uploaded in April 2021, Azzopardi claimed that Abela had received a €300,000 payment for his role in the plot. “So Camilleri is on the side of helping criminals right? He is playing their game no? I am the victim here, not Mark Camilleri or anyone else. My family and I are the victims. People forget that I have a family and all these lies with no proof have a huge impact on my family.” He invited anyone with information or proof should provide it to the family. He said that he had gone to the police himself to go to the police depo to answer any questions the police have.    You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Watch: Thousands gather for Navalny funeral as Kremlin warns against protests,AFP,"Thousands of mourners gathered near a church in southern Moscow on Friday, braving the prospect of arrest to pay their respects to late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at his funeral. The ceremony comes two weeks after Navalny died in an Arctic prison. His supporters accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of murdering his top critic and of trying to prevent him from having a dignified public burial. The Kremlin, which has denied involvement in Navalny's death, warned against ""unauthorised"" protests around the funeral.  RELATED STORIES  Some mourners shouted ""Navalny"" as his coffin arrived at the Mother of God Quench My Sorrows church in Maryino, where the service will be held. The French and German ambassadors were in the crowd, as were some of Russia's last free independent politicians. ""People like him shouldn't be dying: honest and principled, willing to sacrifice themselves,"" said one mourner, Anna Stepanova, outside the church. Fences had been put up around the building, but the passage was left open despite a heavy law enforcement presence and anti-riot police trucks. ""What are they afraid of? Why so many cars?"" Stepanova said. ""They are so afraid themselves,"" she said. ""The people who came here, they are not scared. Alexei wasn't either.""   The burial is scheduled to take place at the Borisovo cemetery, a short walk from the banks of the Moskva River, at 1300 GMT. ""Any unauthorised gatherings will be in violation of the law and those who participate in them will be held responsible,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said according to TASS. Some 400 mourners have been detained at memorials for Navalny since his death, rights organisation OVD-Info has said. The dissident's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, earlier said she feared the funeral could be disrupted by further arrests. ""I'm not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether the police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband,"" Navalnaya told the European Parliament this week. She has directly blamed Putin for his death. Western governments have been quick to hold the Kremlin responsible but have stopped short of making direct accusations of involvement. Putin's spokesman Peskov has criticised the accusations made by her and some Western leaders as ""vulgar"". And on the day of the funeral, Peskov said he had ""nothing to say"" to the family of the deceased.   Navalny had shot to prominence through his anti-corruption campaigning, exposing what he said was rampant graft at the top of Putin's administration. Some of the mourners mentioned the huge influence Navalny had on their political involvement.  ""Because of him, I began to get involved in politics... He was the first public person whom I listened to,"" said 26-year-old Denis, a volunteer at a charity. Navalny was arrested in January 2021 when he returned to Russia after being treated in Germany for a poisoning attack. ""Alexei was tortured for three years,"" Navalnaya told lawmakers in Brussels. ""He was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world and denied visits, phone calls, and then even letters."" ""And then they killed him. Even after that, they abused his body,"" she said. His body was held in a morgue for eight days before being returned to the family, which Navalny's team believed to be a bid to cover up responsibility for his death. His family and his team have also accused authorities of trying to prevent a dignified public burial, fearing it could turn into a flashpoint for dissent.  Navalny's team said local investigators had threatened to bury him on the prison grounds if his mother did not agree to a ""secret"" funeral. Once the body was released, allies struggled to find a place that would agree to hold a funeral ceremony, as well as hearse drivers. And a civil ceremony allowing the general public to pay their respects to the body - common in Russia - has not been allowed. Navalnaya has vowed to continue his life's work and urged to ""fight more desperately, more fiercely than before."" In the crowd near the church, some seemed to agree. ""A person has died, but his ideas will live on thanks to those who have gathered here,"" said Alyona, a 22-year-old archaeologist who came to pay her respects.

Navalny death: What we know,AFP,"Russia's top opposition politician Alexei Navalny died on February 16 at the Arctic prison colony where he was serving a 19-year term. Here is what we know so far about the death of the 47-year-old head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin. Russia's federal penitentiary service said Navalny fell ill after going for a walk. ""Navalny felt bad after a walk, almost immediately losing consciousness. Medical staff arrived immediately and an ambulance team was called,"" the prison service said in a statement. ""Resuscitation measures were carried out that did not yield positive results. Paramedics confirmed the death of the convict. The causes of death are being established,"" it added. Russian news agencies reported that medics from a nearby hospital were called seven minutes later and spent half an hour trying to resuscitate Navalny. Russia's Investigative Committee have opened an investigation into the death. A lawyer for Navalny and a regional court said he had actively participated in a video legal hearing on Thursday, the day before he died, when he did not appear to have any health complaints. Navalny's mother travelled to the remote Arctic region a day after his death. She was not allowed to see the body for several days despite repeated requests. ""It's obvious that the killers want to cover their tracks and are therefore not handing over Alexei's body, hiding it even from his mother,"" Navalny's team said in a post on Telegram. She said she was finally shown her son's body on February 21 and that local investigative officials were trying to pressure her into holding a ""secret"" funeral. Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said on February 24 that the body had finally been handed over to his family. Navalny's supporters said no venues in Moscow were willing to hold a civil public farewell ceremony and even reported problems in finding a hearse to carry the coffin.   Western governments have been quick to hold the Kremlin responsible but have stopped short of making direct accusations of involvement. ""Make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny's death,"" US President Joe Biden said. Biden later met with Yulia Navalnaya and the couple's daughter, Daria. French President Emmanuel Macron said that ""in today's Russia, free spirits are sent to the gulag and condemned to death"". China's foreign ministry declined to comment, saying it was ""Russia's internal affair.""  Spontaneous gatherings occurred outside Russian embassies in capitals across Europe, with protesters blaming Putin for his death. In Russia, a human rights group said some 400 people were detained at tributes for Navalny in the days after his death. Many mourners placed flowers at two monuments in Moscow for victims of Soviet repression amid a heavy police presence. Navalny had been detained in Russia since January 2021 when he was sentenced to a prison colony for ""extremism"". That term was extended to 19 years in August last year. It was just the latest in a string of jail terms for charges that included embezzlement. He had spent most of his detention at the IK-6 penal colony in the Vladimir region, some 250 kilometres (155 miles) east of Moscow. In December he disappeared for more than two weeks. At the end of that month it was revealed that he had been moved to the notorious IK-3 colony at Kharp in the Arctic. Navalny said on social media on December 26 that he was ""fine"" after a ""pretty exhausting"" 20-day transfer to the remote prison. The prison's nickname is ""Polar Wolf"". - Poison before prison -Navalny mobilised huge anti-government protests before being jailed in 2021, after surviving an attempt to assassinate him by poisoning. Starting out as an anti-corruption campaigner in 2007, Navalny led huge protests in 2011-12 and received his first conviction in 2013 for embezzlement. He denied the charges. After being barred from the 2018 presidential election, Navalny was admitted to hospital in Siberia in August 2020 after losing consciousness during a flight. He was transferred to a Berlin hospital where tests showed he was poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. Navalny blamed Putin for the poisoning. The Kremlin denied the accusation.

Editorial: Anti-money laundering bungled procedures,Times of Malta,"In the past decade, Malta’s reputation has been badly battered due to its disregard for anti-money laundering regulations.  Following the country’s greylisting by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the FIAU re-engineered its regulatory processes to convince the task force and the European Banking Authority that its oversight function was being strengthened.  In 2019, the FATF commented: “The FIAU’s appetite to apply higher penalties has recently increased. However, the vast majority of sanctions [penalties] imposed in 2018 by the FIAU are not yet in force, as they are subject to judicial appeal.” In 2022, on the same day that the Court of Appeal reduced a local bank’s FIAU penalty to a fraction of the original amount, EU lawmakers praised FIAU’s reinvigorated enforcement campaign for having already “yielded tangible results”.  Of course, the results of FIAU’s enthusiasm to put its house in order were not so tangible. Between 2018 and 2022, the combined value of AML fines, either appealed or then under appeal, amounted to €16 million of the €20.8 million in total penalties FIAU sought to collect. No fewer than 40 per cent of the 82 AML-related fines imposed against Maltese firms between 2018 and 2022 have been appealed.  The most recent evidence of the FIAU’s bungled anti-money laundering procedures is the decision by the court that confirmed that the procedures and administrative penalties imposed are unconstitutional.  In a detailed judgment, the presiding judge exposed the flaws in the regulatory processes of the FIAU that often acts as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner of entities found guilty of not following strict anti-money laundering regulations.  The judge made some strong criticism of the FIAU practices. She argued: “all this is akin to a dictatorial procedure rather than a procedure where the right to a proper hearing of all parties is meant to prevail.” In the last few years, our courts have either drastically reduced the fines imposed by FIAU or ordered their annulment. It is becoming increasingly common for appellants to question FIAU’s authority to enforce. They argue that the agency disregards their explanations and concerns before penalising them. The failure of the FIAU to embed more robust governance and legal soundness in its regulatory processes is encouraging a culture of not being held accountable by those responsible for preventing money laundering.    In 2022, former FIAU director Kenneth Farrugia told an online trusted anti-money laundering platform that the reduction in penalties by the Maltese courts “are, from an enforcement point of view, moving back to 2015. If we continue like this, in the long run, the effectiveness of our framework may be impacted and called into question once again”.   Farrugia argued: “the courts are integral to Malta’s AML framework. But we cannot go against one another, with one applying an overhauled, internationally reviewed and accepted enforcement methodology and the other sticking to an old and ineffective one.”   Still, 12 of 29 fines imposed in Malta in 2021 were the subject of an ongoing appeal, compared to only three of the 21 AML-related penalties assessed in Spain and one of the 13 AML-related actions finalised in Italy. In Cyprus, where the risk of illicit finance rivals that of Malta, only one of the five AML fines regulators assessed in 2021 ended up in court. Rather than try to occupy the moral high ground, FIAU must follow the example of other jurisdictions to improve the anti-money laundering framework.

Maltese businessman in custody over link to Europe-wide €195 million fraud case,Matthew Xuereb,"A Maltese food importer was remanded in custody on Thursday after refusing to consent to his extradition to Sweden where he is wanted in connection with a Europe-wide investigation into a €195 million VAT fraud case. Mohan Bharwani, 57, from Sliema, was one of 14 individuals who are believed to have orchestrated the massive VAT fraud, spanning across 17 countries. According to Europol, the arrests were the result of an investigation led by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) in Munich and Cologne, with Europol’s support. It said that among the arrested are some of the most high-profile criminal actors, who have been on Europol's radar in recent years, in the area of VAT fraud. Over 180 searches were carried out simultaneously in Albania, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Bharwani was arrested on Wednesday, while the police were searching his property in San Ġwann, Magistrate Abigail Critien heard. Superintendent Mario Cuschieri explained that when he arrested Bharwani, he told him that he was a consultant to a Swedish company. His first reaction was one of total shock but then eventually calmed down and cooperated with the police. Defence lawyers Stefano Filletti, Giannella de Marco and Maurice Meli contested the validity of the arrest, arguing that an arrest warrant must be issued by a judicial authority. In their client’s case, the issuing authority of the European Arrest Warrant was the Swedish Economic Crimes Authority, which is part of the Swedish police force, and was therefore not a judicial authority. They also argued that an arrest warrant had to be signed by a Maltese magistrate. Magistrate Critien, however, disagreed with these arguments and declared the arrest valid. The defence also requested that their client be released on bail, with his wife and youngest son offering to serve as third-party guarantors. The prosecution, led by Police inspectors Roderick Spiteri and Shaun Friggieri objected to the request for bail, insisting that Bharwani posed a flight risk and they had doubts on whether he would obey bail conditions. The court upheld this argument and refused the request for bail. Bharwani was remanded in custody. According to a Europol statement, during the searches in different countries, law enforcement seized vast quantities of smartphones, worth more than €15.3 million, as well as a yacht worth €3 million, and €1.2 million in cash and cryptocurrency. Several cars were seized, including a Rolls Royce, a BMW and a Range Rover. Jewellery, luxury watches and 2.5 kilograms of gold were also found in the suspects’ residences. Europol said the investigation revealed that the suspected organisers of the VAT fraud scheme created a complex criminal ecosystem, which allowed them to defraud up to €195 million through several criminal schemes involving the sale of small electronic devices, such as smartphones. It is understood that the suspects used fraudulent chains of missing traders, who would vanish without fulfilling their tax obligations. In 2020, the same organisers of these VAT fraud schemes are believed to have entered the market for protective face masks. The company managed by the suspects is understood to have bought them from a missing trader, and channelled them through several buffer companies to disguise their final destination. On paper, their company was based in Hong Kong, but the face masks were actually in a warehouse in Germany, and remained there until the German Federal Ministry of Health purchased them from the company ostensibly based in Hong Kong. According to the investigation, neither the company at the beginning of the supply chain, nor the Hong Kong-based company, reimbursed the VAT they had received upon the sale of the face masks to the Ministry.

"Degiorgios claim under oath Cardona, Abela involvement in failed HSBC heist",Matthew Xuereb,"Two men serving 40-year jail terms for murdering Daphne Caruana Galizia on Thursday under oath confirmed previous claims that former Labour ministers Carmelo Abela and Chris Cardona were among those behind the failed HSBC Bank armed robbery in Qormi in 2010. George and Alfred Degiorgio confirmed a public statement that was circulated to all media organisations in January in which they alleged that the former ministers were among those involved in the case. They were testifying in libel proceedings Abela filed against former Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi over a Facebook post in which Azzopardi claimed that Abela had helped the mastermind behind the botched robbery in 2010. In that post, uploaded in April 2021, Azzopardi also claimed that Abela had received a €300,000 payment for his role in the plot.  RELATED STORIES  Those allegations were categorically denied as “lies” by the former PL minister who promptly sued Azzopardi for libel. The Degiorgio brothers both refused to provide more details to back their claims when asked in court. “We will do that when it’s the right time. We will say everything, don’t worry, including information about the other HSBC case in Balzan,” George Degiorgio told Abela’s lawyer, Paul Lia, on his way out of the courtroom. Some €1m were stolen in the robbery from the HSBC bank in Balzan.  The Degiorgio brothers were summoned to testify about the two-page sworn affidavit which they had not initially signed. They confirmed that those were their declarations and had been typed out by their lawyer, Noel Bianco. They did not know why they never signed it but confirmed that they had signed a copy on Thursday morning. The same allegations were made in a letter the two brothers later sent to the European Commission. When asked, they confirmed that their declarations were made in connection with one of several requests for a presidential pardon they had made, but were ignored. “No one took any notice of what we were saying. When the time is right we will say more, much more,” Alfred Degiorgio told Magistrate Rachel Montebello as Abela stood behind him. “But we will not do or say anything without getting anything in return,” both brothers said when asked why they were refusing to back up their statement. “If you wanted to know the entire story, why didn't you come to us four years ago,” Alfred Degiorgio told the court. He said there were five involved in the failed HSBC heist: Abela, Cardona, a certain Toni l-Bigley, former police inspector David Gatt and a certain Duminku, a police officer who was stationed at the police Special Assignment Group in the past. Asked why they were making the claims, George Degiorgio replied that it was because they too wanted justice to be done with them. “We asked for a presidential pardon and the police didn't even listen to us. We had spoken to inspector Joe Mercieca but nothing was ever done. Give us some time and you’ll hear much more,” Degiorgio told Lia during cross-examination. The case continues in April. Lawyer Pawlu Lia is assisting Abela. Lawyer Joseph Zammit Maempel is assisting Azzopardi.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Two men convicted of murdering Run-DMC member Jam Master Jay,Times of Malta,"A US federal jury on Tuesday convicted two men of murdering the famed Run-DMC member Jam Master Jay, a case that had gone unsolved for more than two decades. Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan Jr., the alleged shooter, were found guilty on all counts, convicted of murder while engaged in narcotics trafficking and firearms-related murder. The defendants – Jordan in a forest green vest and pants and Washington in a light blue sweater – were stoic ahead of the verdict’s delivery but grew audibly emotional as they learned of the jury’s decision. “Y’all just killed two innocent people,” Washington said as he and Jordan were led out of the room, while many of their family members and friends who sat through the nearly month-long trial burst into tears. The sentencing will take place at a later date. The proceedings were centered on the events of October 30, 2002, when pioneering rapper Jason “Jay” Mizell, widely known by his DJ moniker, was fatally shot in the head in his Queens studio. He was 37 years old and a father of three.    Prosecutors presented a case of a drug deal gone wrong, saying that Washington and Jordan, who both knew Mizell, killed the famous artist as revenge for cutting them out of a cocaine deal. Federal prosecutors said Jordan – the DJ’s godson – shot a 40-caliber bullet into Mizell’s head, as Washington held others in the room at gunpoint. “No matter the passage of time, be it a day, be it a week, a month, a year, or even two decades, as it was in this case, justice will be served and the harm caused by those who intentionally and senselessly end human life will be redressed,” said Breon Peace, the Eastern District of New York’s head attorney. ‘Justice delayed’ For years, two key witnesses – Lydia High and Uriel “Tony” Rincon, the latter of whom was shot in the leg the night of the murder – had resisted cooperating with law enforcement – reticence both they and prosecutors ascribed to fear. “It’s no mystery why it took years to indict and arrest the defendants,” said Peace. “The witnesses in the recording studio knew the killers, and they were terrified that they would be retaliated against if they cooperated with law enforcement.” “But their strength and resolve in testifying at this trial were a triumph of right over wrong and courage over fear.” A third person, Jay Bryant, will be tried at a later date.  Defence teams had insisted that Bryant was in fact the killer, pointing out that his hat was discovered at the crime scene. Prosecutors allege Bryant let Mizell’s murderers into the musician’s studio, but accuse him of being an accomplice to the larger conspiracy, not the shooter. “No comment,” said one member of Washington’s defence team when queried by AFP following the verdict. Speaking to reporters, Mizell’s cousin Carlis Thompson, who sat in the gallery throughout the proceedings, called the verdict a “long time coming” but said “justice delayed is not always justice denied”. Double life The trial revealed a lesser-known side of Mizell, who along with his band Run-DMC had railed against drug culture. But prosecutors said Mizell got involved in the narcotics trade to support his lifestyle and those close to him, as buzz around the group’s music –  hits include It’s Tricky and Walk This Way – began to fade. He was a quiet middleman on drug deals, and a financial fount for family and friends, in the years preceding his death, they said.   Along with LL Cool J and Public Enemy, Run-DMC were trailblazers of new-school hip-hop – mixing rock elements, aggressive boasting and sociopolitical commentary – and its outgrowth, golden era hip-hop, which included eclectic sampling. The seminal group were the first rappers featured on MTV, and established a new rap aesthetic incorporating street culture – a departure from the flashy, disco-inflected attire of their predecessors. Prior to his death, Mizell was influential in New York as a cultivator of local talent, working with young rappers and co-founding a DJ academy. Jam Master Jay’s slaying followed a spate of murders within the rap community in the 1990s, including the shootings of superstars The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.

Three arrested in €2 billion money laundering probe,AFP,"Police in three European countries on Tuesday arrested the masterminds behind an online money-laundering operation suspected of processing up to €2 billion, the continent's judicial agency said. Italian, Latvian and Lithuanian police swooped on 55 premises and arrested 18 people - including three main suspects - believed to be involved in the scheme, Eurojust said. ""Since 2017 an estimated €2 billion has been laundered by the two main suspects via a worldwide web of shell companies,"" the Hague-based agency said. One suspect was arrested ""for defrauding the Italian authorities of €15 million in public funds,"" it said in a statement. Eurojust said Lithuanian authorities closed down an ""electronic payment service"" linked to the case in 2022. The suspects now detained had ""offered money laundering online as a service to criminals"". They are suspected of laundering funds via a ""myriad web of enterprises"" linked to the payment service, Eurojust said. The system was set up in 2016 in Lithuania by an Italian-based gang and laundered proceeds from a ""range of criminal activities"", Eurojust said. These included money from tax evasion, cyber fraud, fake bankruptcy and drug trafficking. Part of the proceeds were laundered via the purchase of real estate and luxury vehicles in Latvia and Lithuania. ""The laundered money also included the €15 million from unlawfully obtained so-called building bonuses, provided by the Italian national authorities,"" Eurojust said. The bonuses were given for renovation and insulation work and other energy-saving measures, while in reality no work took place or ""the buildings did not even exist,"" Eurojust said. Italian police first started their probe in 2021 and a year later were joined by their Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts, supported by Eurojust and its policing twin Europol. ""A rapid reaction of Latvian and Lithuanian authorities to reports on suspicious transactions led to the identification and freezing of millions in funds, real estate properties and luxury vehicles, which now can be confiscated,"" Eurojust said.

Sandro Camilleri to lead Housing Authority's enforcement wing,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Updated 7pm Former police superintendent Sandro Camilleri has been employed in one of the highest-ranking positions at the Housing Authority. Times of Malta confirmed Camilleri took on the role of regulatory compliance manager on Monday, managing, coordinating and overseeing the Housing Authority's enforcement wing. The 47-year-old ardent and long-time police officer has been tasked with ensuring that people living in social housing are compliant with the regulations and conditions of their housing agreements. He will be conducting routine inspections on properties administered by or registered with the Housing Authority, investigating squatting cases and overseeing the authority's cases in court. Author Mark Camilleri first revealed Camilleri's new job on his blog on Sunday. Sources close to the government said Camilleri was employed after applying for a call issued by the Housing Authority. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) and was employed on an indefinite contract. Camilleri left the police force last week after a 30-year career. He is best known for having been the first president of the Police Officers Union, which is affiliated with the General Workers’ Union. He previously served in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and led the police’s prosecution unit. He was also superintendent in charge of the Sliema and Ħamrun districts and one of the earliest advocates for police body-worn cameras. Camilleri is known for his spirited television and media appearances, during which he often called out social injustices and problems within the police force and advocated for better conditions for police officers. He was also instrumental in the case of Emanuel Camilleri - the man who was wrongly accused of sexually abusing his daughter, a crime he had been jailed for. Camilleri had investigated the claims against the daughter, which effectively led to the father being released from prison. Most recently, in 2022, he was tasked to head a unit investigating major money laundering cases within the police’s Financial Crime Investigation Department (FCID). Police officers can retire after 25 years of service, which means Camilleri was eligible to call it a day. However, the reasons behind his exit are not clear and Camilleri declined to comment when contacted. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Phone tap did not breach George Degiorgio’s fundamental rights, court rules",Edwina Brincat,"George Degiorgio’s fundamental rights were not breached when his phone was tapped when police were monitoring his suspected involvement in a series of bombings months before the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the Constitutional Court declared.  The validity of that warrant, presented in court inside a sealed envelope by the Malta Security Services Chief, was a determining factor in reversing a previous court decision which concluded that Degiorgio’s right to protection of his private and family life had been breached.  In 2021, a judgment handed down by the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction awarded Degiorgio €10,000 in damages for the breach.  The decision was reversed on Monday through a judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court following three separate appeals filed by Degiorgio himself, the MSS chief as well as the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner.  The awarded damages were also revoked.  The proceedings concerned a breach of rights claim by Degiorgio who argued that criminal charges linking him to the journalist’s murder on October 16, 2017, stemmed from “unlawfully obtained evidence,” namely a phone intercept that was obtained under an expired warrant.  When the case moved to the appeal stage, the Constitutional Court ordered the MSS chief to present that warrant targeting Degiorgio, together with any subsequent variations and renewals.  That information would “ensure that the truth is known”, the court declared when issuing that order.  The MSS chief complied and produced the documents in a sealed envelope on May 10, 2022.  Both the MSS as well as the Police Commissioner and the Attorney General - subsequently replaced by the State Advocate - argued that the first court ought to have ordered that warrant to be presented in evidence.  The first court had partly upheld Degiorgio’s claims after concluding that there was no evidence that the phone taps had been covered by a valid warrant.  The appellants also argued that the first court was mistaken in saying that the phone taps breached Degiorgio’s rights because they were obtained for a different purpose to that for which the warrant was issued in the first place.  During the proceedings, Superintendent Keith Arnaud testified that he had requested the MSS to monitor Degiorgio in February 2017 when both George and his brother Alfred were suspected of being involved in a series of bombing and shooting cases. A warrant to intercept Degiorgio’s two phones was issued under the signature of the relative minister on February 20, 2017, for a term of six months.  Another phone number was added to the warrant in March and the warrant itself was renewed in August 2017 for a further six months. That evidence was not contested by Degiorgio, observed the court.  Caruana Galizia was murdered when the warrant was still in force.  “The evidence did not indicate that when the warrant was issued the authorities had any information that [Degiorgio] was planning Caruana Galizia’s murder,” said the judges.  Although the intercepts were not done specifically about the journalist’s murder, that did not mean that any information gathered using that warrant could not be used as evidence against Degiorgio.  This was not a case involving some “minor crime,” but a case of homicide which was so serious that it was in the general interest to solve.  Degiorgio was well known to the police and was being investigated for other serious crimes.  The warrant directly targeted him.  That fact was not contested and even less so was evidence produced to show that such suspicions in his regard were frivolous. The court, presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, declared that Degiorgio’s rights were not breached.  Phone intercepts were one of the most effective methods used by those responsible for protecting the country’s security to infiltrate dangerous criminal organisations that operate underground. Moreover, pending appeal proceedings there had been an important development since Degiorgio had registered an admission to the murder and was condemned to a 40-year jail term that was confirmed on appeal.  The court, however, took on board the “very valid and relevant” observations made by the first court about the Security Service Act. “Obviously where the power of the executive is exercised secretly, risks of abuse increase.”  The MSS chief is nominated by the Prime Minister and phone taps are done under a ministerial warrant.  There is no authority to scrutinise that such secret surveillance measures are carried out proportionately.  Any review thereof does not eliminate the danger of abuse at the stage when the warrant is issued and surveillance effected, observed the judges, thus directing the court registrar to notify this judgment to the relative minister and the commissioner of laws.  The legislation needs to be reviewed to ensure that it is in line with the European Convention on Human Rights provision on private and family life.  Such review would ensure that work done to safeguard national security does not go up in smoke simply because the information gathered is not admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings.  In Degiorgio’s case, there was no evidence of such abuse of power and the phone taps were only used as intelligence, said the court, also throwing out Degiorgio’s argument that he suffered pre-trial prejudicial publicity.

Man says woman stole €750 in coins he saved from quitting smoking,Matthew Xuereb,"A man told a court on Monday that a woman whom he had only met once had stolen around €750 he had managed to put aside after quitting smoking.  Emanuel Dalli said he had taken the woman home after having a pizza together and she had returned to steal his savings. He was testifying against 28-year-old Yanika Cuschieri from Birkirkara, who is being accused of theft, committing a crime while on probation and relapsing. The man told Magistrate Leonard Caruana the woman had told him about the difficulties she was facing so he offered that she could clean his place in return for some extra cash. However, when on February 3 he was returning home at around 10pm he saw the woman accompanied by another man, leaving his house. He grabbed the man by the neck while his son, who had accompanied him home, held the woman until the police arrived. While they were waiting for the police, the man told him that he had nothing to do with the entire operation while the woman began accusing him of misdemeanour in her regard. He said he found the back door of his house unlocked and understood that the couple had entered through there to steal. He added she stole around €750 in one and two euro coins. The case continues next month. Inspector Kurt Farrugia, assisted by Attorney Joseph Camilleri Azarov and Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Attorney General's office, prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Gżira firm is focal point of ‘large-scale’ investigation,Jacob Borg,"Updated on February 26 with Papaya statement A financial institution in Gżira is a focal point of an international investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network,” Times of Malta can reveal. Police this week carried out searches at Papaya, an e-money company suspected of offering ‘money-laundering services’ to the criminal network. Although certain details about the international probe have been disclosed, Papaya has not yet been publicly named as the financial institution in question. EuroJust, the EU’s criminal justice cooperation agency, said at least €4.5 million were laundered through Malta since the end of 2015, though the total sum could amount to “tens of millions of euros”. Investigators are combing through Papaya’s list of account holders and transactions as part of the ongoing probe, sources told Times of Malta. National authorities in Malta, Latvia, Germany, France and Italy conducted more than 100 searches in a large-scale operation against the alleged criminal network. EuroJust said this week that the Maltese financial institution, in reference to Papaya, and the “organised crime group behind it” offered “money-laundering services” via a network of fake companies. Corporate records name Latvian national Dmitry Panurksis as Papaya’s owner. Panurksis did not respond to a request for comment by Times of Malta. Lawyer Tonio Fenech, who was a director of Papaya for a number of years, said he resigned from his role in the first half of 2023.   “I would therefore ask you to refer your questions to whoever represents the company as per the registry of companies,” Fenech said when contacted. Investigations were initiated in 2021 by the Latvian authorities after they noticed unusual money transfers from Latvia to Malta. Simultaneously, the German authorities started investigations into suspicious money flows to Malta. Papaya CEO hit by sanctions Papaya was set up in 2012 by Frederic Villa, a Swiss national who resides in Malta. He relinquished ownership of Papaya in 2016, however stayed on as its CEO and director. In February 2023, Villa was hit with sanctions by the US government. That same month, the Maltese authorities were tipped off about an alleged “plot” in 2022 to launder tens of millions of euros in Russian cash through Malta. Villa was named in the intelligence tip off as one of the potential parties to the “plot”.   When contacted, Villa strongly denied involvement in or knowledge of any such plot.   “I never, in any way, shape or form endorsed, engaged in or somehow approved any form of money laundering nor did I ever allow the companies in which I was involved to be so involved,” Villa said. Villa was among dozens of individuals and companies sanctioned by the United States in 2023, as part of an effort to target companies and people providing “material support” to Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. He was placed on the sanctions list over his role as a director of a Maltese company called Stratton Investment Group, which held an account at Papaya. Russia links Stratton’s parent company is believed by the US to have been involved in “covert procurement schemes” to supply sensitive Western technologies and equipment for Russian intelligence service and the Russian military. The parent company is owned by Swiss-Italian businessman Walter Moretti, who was also sanctioned. Villa told Times of Malta he had been placed on the US sanctions list solely due to his role as a director of Stratton. He said Stratton had been dormant for two years prior to the sanctioning.  Intelligence passed on to the Maltese authorities identified the need for further information on Stratton’s banking activities, particularly at Papaya. Villa said the only transaction Stratton was involved in was a €4.3 million one with a UK company, and all the necessary anti-money laundering checks had been carried. “All this information has been given to the authorities, after my sanctioning. There has been full transparency. Since my sanctioning, I have resigned from the directorship of Stratton, and have had no further contact with Mr Moretti.”   Villa said he had also immediately resigned from Integritas, a corporate service provider he owns, that provided services to Stratton and Moretti. Villa said he did this to be able to focus on taking all the required and necessary steps to clear his name both locally and internationally.   He also relinquished his role as Papaya’s CEO and director after being sanctioned in February 2023. Malta’s anti-money laundering unit last year fined Papaya €279,000 for its “minimal” regard towards its anti-money laundering obligations.   The FIAU said documents collected to support transactions taking place were deemed “inadequate” and, at times, created “more doubts rather than clarifications” regarding the transactions taking place at Papaya. In one example, the FIAU noted how a loan agreement between two Papaya customers for €700,000 was “updated” to €7 million. The FIAU said the loan agreements in place shed little light on the purpose of the loans. It said Papaya failed to scrutinise loan documents and the transactions taking place, in breach of its legal obligations. Papaya subsequently appealed the fine. In a statement on Monday, Papaya said it has continued to operate as normal.  ""As a licensed financial institution, Papaya maintains a strong working relationship with Maltese and other European authorities, including but not limited to regulators, auditors, police, Europol, and other law enforcement units. ""Indeed, there have been requests from authorities regarding the activities of some Papaya’s clients. These requests are not associated with the operations of Papaya as a financial institution, Papaya is not suspected of offering any money laundering services or other illegal business, and is not subjected to any form of legal proceedings,"" Papaya's owner Dmitry Panurksis said.  To facilitate ""the claim resolution process,"" Panurksis said Papaya and the above-mentioned clients closely cooperate with the authorities as part of the standard appropriate procedures. ""Meanwhile, these inquiries do not affect Papaya’s business; none of the clients’ accounts surveyed by the authorities were blocked nor arrested. Further commentary cannot be provided considering the interests of authorities. ""With regard to Mr. Villa and Mr. Fenech, they no longer work within Papaya since last year, and we believe it is not appropriate to discuss their personal endeavours within the context of the article, which pertains to the activities of our Electronic Money Institution"".  About the fine imposed by the FIAU, Panurksis said Papaya is indeed engaged in the appeal process and we will persist until the penalty is rescinded, ""as we have our own stance regarding this matter to our colleagues from FIAU"" ""For additional clarification, please, consider contacting FIAU directly.

Maltese man wanted by the FBI for malware charges appeals US extradition,Jessica Arena,"A Maltese man wanted by the FBI for selling malware on the dark web has appealed his extradition to the United States after previously having consented.  Daniel John Meli, 27, of Żabbar was arrested on February 7 and subsequently arraigned on February 9, after US prosecutors accused him of selling malware products, including the Pegasus remote access trojan (RAT) to cybercriminals.  Initially, Meli consented to be extradited to face the charges but had a change of heart after he got new lawyers, filing an appeal to overturn the extradition order.  In an application signed by Marion Camilleri and Arthur Azzopardi, Meli’s lawyers argue that while the first court had been satisfied that the man had consented to the extradition of his own volition, they alleged that it had failed to ensure that he had fully understood what he was consenting to, namely being put on a plane to the US to face hefty charges that could land him up to 40-years in prison far away from home, if found guilty.  Meli, they argued, has a documented history of mental health issues, takes regular medication to treat these issues and was previously admitted to both Mater Dei and Mount Carmel hospitals.  With this context, the court should have assured that Meli was in a sound enough state to understand what was being asked of him when he consented to the extradition and cast doubt on whether this could truly be considered voluntary in such circumstances.  Meli’s legal team also invoked the principle of territoriality, arguing that the allegations made against him indicated that if the alleged crimes had occurred, they had happened in Malta and by a Maltese citizen.  Therefore, if the Maltese state found the evidence brought to it by the FBI to be credible and compelling, it had an obligation to investigate and charge the man for these alleged crimes in Malta before he could ever be extradited to face these charges overseas.  Judge Neville Camilleri is expected to rule on the appeal next week.  American authorities suspect Meli has been selling malware online since “at least 2012”, but started building the case against him in February 2022, when he allegedly sold the software to an undercover FBI operative for $180 in Bitcoin. He is now facing charges of conspiracy, obtaining unauthorised access to protected computers to obtain information, illegally selling an interception device, and illegally advertising an interception device.  Each of these charges carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of causing unauthorised damage to protected computers provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.  The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Europol were among a number of international police forces to have worked together on Meli’s arrest.  Another man, Prince Onyeoziri Odinakachi, 31, was also arrested in Nigeria earlier this month for allegedly having provided customer support to those who purchased and made use of the malware.

Fr Luke Seguna claims court has breached his rights by losing his laptop,Matthew Xuereb,"Marsaxlokk parish priest Luke Seguna has filed an urgent constitutional case claiming a breach of his right to a fair trial after his laptop went missing from the law courts’ exhibit room. The priest, who is facing fraud charges, also claimed that other evidence seized by the police when they had started their investigations was never passed on to court-appointed experts and that the chain of custody of such important proof had been lost. The case was filed after a court heard on Tuesday that the court-seized laptop – a MacBook Pro – could not be found in the law courts’ exhibit room. Court expert Keith Cutajar told Magistrate Rachel Montebello how he was nominated by the court to examine the contents of the laptop but when he asked the exhibits’ officer for the device, it could not be found. The laptop was exhibited in court by the prosecution on June 19 last year. Since it is bulky it is not kept with the court documents but sent to the exhibits’ room after a registration number is allocated to it.   Cutajar said that, when he asked for the laptop and produced the relevant dates and number, he was told by the exhibit officer “we can’t find the laptop”. The magistrate ordered that the exhibits’ officer be summoned to testify in the next sitting together with the police officer who exhibited it. The court expert was testifying in the compilation of evidence against Fr Luke Seguna who is facing charges of fraud, misappropriation and money laundering, with prosecutors claiming he swindled some 150 of his parishioners out of around €500,000 over a 10-year-span. He is denying the charges. In an urgent application filed in the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, Seguna claimed that his right to a fair trial had been breached when the laptop went missing. He and other documentary evidence seized by the police were also never passed on to the inquiring magistrate, in blatant breach of the basic responsibility of the investigating officer to preserve the chain of custody of such evidence. Seguna’s lawyers Jose Herrera, Matthew Xuereb and David Camilleri insisted that the administrative shortcomings began when the police failed to inform the inquiring magistrate so that documentary evidence is conserved by court-appointed experts. The missing laptop and missing documents seized from the Marsaxlokk parish home by the police were important to prove his innocence. The laptop was analysed by the police, who are not court experts and there is no peace of mind about what the police had done with it, the lawyers claimed. They said that all these shortcomings were failing to ensure that their client is afforded a fair trial and called on the court to decree on the matter. Over a number of sittings since last August, numerous parishioners testified about the valuable work done by Fr Luke for the parish church and the people of Marsaxlokk, some saying that they missed his charitable acts.   Witnesses said that they willingly donated funds under the “arbural” system, while others explained that they used to donate money to the priest to be used by him as he best deemed fit. However, prosecutors claim that the priest held hundreds of thousands of euros in various bank accounts, together with a collection of five motorbikes and two cars, despite a relatively meagre income as a clergyman. Several suspicious bank transactions had triggered police investigations in his regard. Some €148,000 were allegedly traced to payment processing companies linked to a porn site, while police also tracked down several cheques totalling around €18,000 issued by a third party to the priest.

UK police make record drugs seizure,AFP,"British police said Friday that they had made what is believed to be its biggest ever seizure of serious drugs. The National Crime Agency said that 5,700 kg of cocaine were found in a container at the port of Southampton on England's south coast on February 8. The drug haul was discovered hidden in a cargo of bananas that had been transported from South America, the agency said in a statement. It had an estimated value of £450 million (€526 million) based on UK street prices, the NCA added. Officers believe the drugs were heading to Hamburg in Germany ""for onward delivery"", the statement said. ""This record-breaking seizure will represent a huge hit to the international organised crime cartels involved, denying them massive profits,"" said NCA director Chris Farrimond. The previous largest seizure of drugs in the UK was 3.7 tonnes of cocaine found in Southampton in 2022. The NCA estimates that criminal gangs make around £4 billion a year from Britain's illegal cocaine market. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Scam reports more than double in a year, €12.5m lost in 2023",Neville Borg,"The number of online scams reported to the police more than doubled over the past year, highlighting the ever-growing threat posed by online fraudsters. Speaking in parliament earlier this week, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri revealed that there were 2,517 cases of online fraud reported to the police throughout 2023, far more than the 1,088 reported in 2022. Camilleri was replying to a parliamentary question submitted by PN MP Darren Carabott. This means that people in Malta lost some €12.5m to scams and online fraud in 2023, almost 50% higher than the €8.5m they lost in 2022, according to figures provided by the police.  RELATED STORIES  The true figure is likely to be even higher, with international research suggesting that around a third of all scams go unreported. Online scams have proliferated in recent years, rising from just a handful each year a decade ago, to over 2,500 today, as technology developed throughout the years. A police spokesperson told Times of Malta that many of the more successful scams tend to be bank message scams, where scammers use what initially appears to be a genuine message from a trusted bank to gain access to people’s savings. The success of these scams “can be attributed to scammers exploiting the trust victims have in financial institutions”, the spokesperson warned. Scammers are becoming increasingly adept at spoofing banks’ communication channels, frequently sending customers fake messages from what appears to be a bank’s real telephone number. Unsuspecting customers, believing the message to be genuine, are then duped into handing over their personal details or money, sometimes to the tune of thousands of euros. Police say that scammers often use “urgency tactics”, such as claiming that a person has to perform a certain action within a specific time period or risk losing access to their accounts. According to the police, scammers often target people “who rely heavily on digital banking”, further increasing their chance of success. The “vast majority” of these scams tend to originate from overseas, according to the police. This often makes it more difficult for authorities to trace transactions and recover stolen money. New guidelines published by the Financial Arbiter late last year say that banks can be held liable in cases in which their customers are scammed, if they fail to adequately warn customers about scams imitating their communication channels. In one such case last year, BOV were instructed to pay 40% of one client’s losses, after the client clicked on a link in a fraudulent SMS they believed to be sent by the bank, eventually losing over €4,000 to the scam. The move is likely to see banks step up their communication in an effort to warn their clients of scams that are doing the rounds.

Man accused of stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept ,Jessica Arena,"A 63-year-old man was remanded in custody on Thursday after denying stabbing his brother-in-law while he slept. Robert Frendo from Paola was arraigned in front of Magistrate Nadine Lia on Thursday charged with the attempted murder of his brother-in-law, Joseph Seychell, in the house where they both live. Inspector Keith Rizzo told the court he had responded to a request for assistance on February 20 in Triq Lampuka in Paola, where he found an ambulance on site and a doctor treating the alleged victim. Seychell told the inspector that Frendo had stabbed him multiple times in his sleep. Later, Rizzo said that Frendo was apprehended by the police and he spoke to him at the police station where he informed him of his rights. The accused was also charged with causing grievous injuries to Seychell and causing him to fear violence as well as carrying a weapon. When asked to confirm his identity to the court, Frendo paused before declaring that he was “guilty”, although he had not been asked to enter a plea. Before the standard questioning could continue, the proceedings were briefly suspended as Frendo was hauled away by his lawyer. Subsequently, after proceedings continued, lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutajar replied that the accused was choosing to plead not guilty and that the accused had previously “misunderstood the court”. Addressing members of the media present in the courtroom, Magistrate Lia told reporters that the case should not be “prejudicated” by Frendo’s earlier statement and that the official plea was the one registered after consultation with his lawyer. No request for bail was made. Police inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo as well as AG lawyers Nathaniel Falzon and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted.

Australian bishop charged with sex crimes,AFP,"An Australian bishop is facing accusations of rape and indecent assault, becoming one of the most senior Catholics in the country to be charged with sex crimes.   Emeritus Bishop Christopher Alan Saunders was arrested in Western Australia on Wednesday evening after a high-powered internal Vatican investigation spurred child abuse detectives into action.  Police said he has been charged with 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault and two counts of sexual penetration without consent -- a legal term for rape. The 74-year-old, who is due to front court on Thursday, has also been charged with three counts of ""indecently dealing with a child"" between 16 and 18 years old. Archbishop of Perth Timothy Costelloe, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said the allegations were ""deeply distressing"".  ""It is right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated,"" he said in a statement.  Court documents show Saunders' alleged offences took place between 2008 and 2014.  For more than 20 years, Saunders presided over the Diocese of Broome, a sweeping coastal region in northwest Australia dotted with dozens of remote Aboriginal communities.  He stood down as bishop in 2020 when allegations of sexual abuse first surfaced in local media - but retained the honorary title of ""emeritus bishop"". An initial police investigation failed to unearth sufficient evidence to charge Saunders, who has been steadfast in his denials.  But with persistent rumours swirling around the clergyman, the Vatican launched its own probe in 2022 using sweeping powers first established by Pope Francis.  The ""Vos estis lux mundi"" powers - meaning ""You are the light of the world"" in Latin - were drawn up in 2019 to help the church investigate sexual abuse accusations at the highest levels.  The confidential church findings were later shared with police, who subsequently re-opened their investigation.  George Pell, the late Australian cardinal and Vatican powerbroker, was imprisoned on sexual abuse charges in 2019 - but his convictions were quashed the next year.

Eurojust suspects Maltese company laundered millions for criminal ring,Times of Malta,"A Maltese financial institution laundered at least €4.5 million in proceeds from criminal activities since the end of 2015, a pan-European police investigation has concluded. “The total sum of laundered money could amount to tens of millions of euros,” Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, said on Wednesday. The unnamed firm was searched by police officers assisted by German counterparts, as part of a massive police operation involving more than 100 searches across five countries.  National authorities in Latvia, Germany, France, Italy and Malta carried out more than 100 searches in a large-scale operation against a Russian-Eurasian criminal network and a Maltese-based financial institution allegedly involved in money-laundering services. Estonia was also involved. Four suspects were detained during an action day supported by Eurojust and Europol. Potential suspects and witnesses were also interviewed in Latvia, Germany, Estonia and Malta. More than 460 police officers were deployed to carry out the searches with Germany also deploying four officers to support the investigations and searches in Latvia and Malta. In addition to the arrests, various bank accounts and properties were seized. Eurojust said that the Maltese financial institution and the organised crime group behind it offered money-laundering services via a network of fake enterprises and individuals who were registered directors, without performing any real business activities. The organised crime group operated mainly from Riga and Berlin. Investigations were initiated in 2021 by the Latvian authorities after they noticed unusual money transfers from Latvia to the Maltese financial institution.  Simultaneously, the German authorities started investigations into suspicious money flows involving the same financial institution. Eurojust said it supported the concerted action by setting up a coordination centre and establishing and funding a joint investigation team between the German and Latvian authorities. The agency also organised five dedicated coordination meetings to prepare for the action day and assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders in the countries involved. On Wednesday, Europol deployed a money laundering expert to Latvia and set up a mobile office at Eurojust’s coordination centre to support the operation.  Since December 2021, Europol has been supporting the investigation by providing operational and financial analysis and operational expertise. The agency also supported the joint investigation team and provided financial support to the case.

Plea bargains: necessary evil or swift justice?,Claudia Calleja,"Three men charged with gruesome crimes admitted to the charges following plea bargain agreements. Claudia Calleja questions the reason behind the process in this article published before Eliott Paul Busuttil and Jeremie Camilleri were sentenced on March 5. In 10 days of legal drama, three men facing life behind bars for three different murders admitted their guilt in exchange for reduced sentences, sparking questions about the intricacies of the so-called plea-bargaining process. Legal experts suggest that such agreements are often sought when defence lawyers perceive no viable escape routes for their clients. For the prosecution and victims’ families, plea bargains offer a quicker resolution, reduced expenses, and the invaluable testimony needed to bring other perpetrators to justice. “Sometimes the prosecution has damning evidence and there is no way out,” one lawyer said. Another added: “This [plea bargaining] is also as a result of media coverage leading to the accused being wary of risking life due to a preconditioned jury pool and thus opt to cut their losses and avoid life.” Recent data provided by the Justice Ministry showed 102 cases awaiting trial by jury until the beginning of February. They involved 119 individuals and the oldest case dated back to 2009.  Plea bargaining facilitates the administration of justice as it expedites cases and helps reduce this heavy backlog, according to lawyers Joe Giglio and Jason Azzopardi. “It benefits the victims because it brings closure without the need of putting them through a lengthy trial,” said Giglio. Taking a case before a panel of jurors, came with risks for both the defence and the prosecution, Azzopardi added. Stefano Filletti, Head of Department of Criminal Law at the University of Malta, explained that if the State (through the attorney general) – and the accused – came to a sentencing agreement, it was common practice that the AG took the wishes of the family of the injured party into account.   He said sentence bargaining and plea bargaining were essential tools in the administration of justice. First, they brought quicker closure to the victims and swifter justice to the accused and were also cost-effective. Data from 2016 showed that a trial cost about €3,000 per day. “When doing away with a trial by jury, the system becomes more efficient, quicker and less expensive,” Filletti said. There was another important function of sentence bargaining. If a co-accused admitted to a crime against a plea-bargaining agreement, then the AG could summon that person to testify – increasing the chances of conviction of others who did not admit. This is what happened on February 13, when Danish national Jesper Kristiansen, one of the three men awaiting trial for the 2020 Sliema double murder, admitted after agreeing to a plea deal of 40 years’ jail. He admitted to his involvement in the murder of Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski at their home in August 2020. Two other men are also facing murder charges. Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison. As his plea deal has now been formalised, he is able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. On February 15, Elliot Paul Busuttil, 40, from Attard admitted to murdering taxi driver Mario Farrugia, who was found dead in the trunk of his car two years ago, as well as the attempted murder of a second man, Emil Marinov. Farrugia, 62, from Pembroke, was stabbed more than 40 times and then left in the trunk of his car in a Qormi valley in April 2022. At the time, Busuttil was out on bail for the attempted murder of Bulgarian national Emil Marinov, who was found in Ta’ Qali in August 2020, after also being stabbed multiple times.  The court was informed that the prosecution and defence had agreed on a 35-year prison sentence. On February 4, Jeremie Camilleri admitted to having intentionally ran over Pelin Kaya and then threw stones at her dead body last year, reversing his initial not guilty plea. Kaya was mowed down by his BMW car as she walked home along Testaferrata Street, Gżira, hours into her 30th birthday celebration. His case will now be sent to a criminal court judge, who will sentence him. Camilleri faces up to a lifetime sentence in prison, though defence lawyers told the court they had reached an agreement with all parties, including the victim’s family. In an Instagram post, Kaya’s sister, Derya, confirmed that the family was consulted by the attorney general’s office about the plea bargaining and agreed. She wrote: “Pelin will never come back, and the pain will never go away. Even though we think the murderer deserves the harshest punishment, in order to ensure... the speedy conclusion considering the difficult and exhausting nature of the process we can confirm that we were consulted... We never want it to be thought that we have given up, we took this step so that our family can breathe a little.”   Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski – the brothers of murdered men Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski – said the news that one alleged killer pleaded guilty in exchange for a set jail term of 40 years “is the first step in bringing closure, although nothing can be done to bring the loved ones back”. Karl Grech, director of Victim Support Malta, said many victims view plea bargains with scepticism because they worry such agreements may allow offenders to receive lenient sentences, thus diminishing the sense of justice and accountability. For some, a trial represents a public acknowledgement of the harm they suffered and an opportunity for the offender to be held fully accountable. “The way a plea bargain is perceived can significantly affect a victim’s healing process. However, if the deal is seen as unjust or too lenient, it can exacerbate feelings of pain and anger, hindering recovery. “A significant challenge in assisting crime victims is the protracted duration from case initiation to its hearing, and ultimately, to sentencing. This extended timeline can exacerbate trauma for victims. Therefore, implementing measures to expedite the legal process could significantly alleviate the additional stress caused by drawn-out court proceedings,” he said.

"US police arrest child, 9, over deadly family shooting",AFP,"Police in the United States have arrested a nine-year-old child over the death of a family member who was shot in the head, officials said Tuesday. Emergency services raced to Tooele, in the Midwestern state of Utah on Friday evening where they found a 32-year-old man who had been grievously wounded. ""He suffered from what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the head,"" said Officer Colbey Bentley of Tooele City Police Department. The man, who has not been identified, was rushed to hospital in nearby Salt Lake City but died from his injuries. ""The investigation led to the arrest of a nine-year-old, who is a family member of the 32-year-old male,"" Bentley told AFP. The child, who also has not been named, was arrested some time on Friday evening. ""We're looking into a potential charge of homicide,"" Bentley said. Firearms claim tens of thousands of lives every year in the United States, a country where there are more guns than people. Polls repeatedly show a majority of Americans are in favour of stricter rules on ownership, but a powerful gun lobby continues to hold Washington's political class in its grip.

Youths in Floriana gang attack case placed under supervision order by court,Matthew Xuereb,"A judge on Monday issued a supervision order for six youths who allegedly ganged up against a 16-year-old boy, robbing him of cash and stabbing him with a penknife in a Floriana public garden on February 3. Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera upheld a request by the attorney general’s office which asked the court to impose harsher bail conditions on the five girls and a boy who stand charged with the assault. Attorney general lawyer Kenneth Camilleri told the court during a hearing on an urgent application filed before the Court of Appeal that the first court had been “very lenient” with the accused, especially after having ignored the prosecution’s concerns about the strong possibility of tampering with evidence. In a decree, the judge said Magistrate Joe Mifsud was not wrong in using his discretion to release the youth on bail but should have imposed different bail conditions, especially since the alleged victim had not yet testified. Last Tuesday, the group, aged between 14 and 20, were charged in court after they were identified as the alleged aggressors behind the mugging that took place on the previous Saturday evening at around 7pm at a public garden just outside City Gate. Police from the Valletta station found the victim lying on the ground, with visible injuries to his face and hands. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sustained cut ligaments in his hands. His injuries were classified as grievous. The 14-year-old boy and five females – one aged 17 from Paola, two sisters aged 14 and 15 from Gżira, a 15-year-old from Valletta and 20-year-old Aicha Mariah from Paola – all pleaded not guilty. Three of the girls were charged with aggravated theft while the 20-year-old was separately charged with unlawful possession of the penknife as well as relapsing. The alleged victim was not only attacked but also robbed of his bag, containing some €90 in cash. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera placed all defendants under a supervision order to ensure they are followed closely throughout the course of the criminal case against them. Moreover, she ordered Aicha Mariah – the eldest of the group – to pay €500 as a bail deposit. The court retained the €2,000 personal guarantee, the curfew between 10pm and 6am, the order to sign the bail book once a week and the strict orders not to approach the victim in any manner. Lawyers Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb, Adreana Zammit, Ishmael Psaila, Dustin Camilleri and Alexia Attard were defence counsel.

Watch: Palestinians accuse Israel of 'apartheid' at UN top court,AFP,"Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al-Maliki told the UN's top court Monday his people were suffering ""colonialism and apartheid"" under the Israelis, as judges weigh the legal consequences of Israel's occupation. ""The Palestinians have endured colonialism and apartheid... There are those who are enraged by these words. They should be enraged by the reality we are suffering,"" Al-Maliki said. The ICJ is holding hearings all week on the legal implications of Israel's occupation since 1967, with an unprecedented 52 countries expected to give evidence.   Nations including the United States, Russia, and China will address judges at the Peace Palace in The Hague, seat of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The minister urged the court to declare the occupation illegal and order it to stop ""immediately, totally and unconditionally."" ""Justice delayed is justice denied and the Palestinian people have been denied justice for far too long,"" he said.  ""It is time to put an end to the double standards that have kept our people captive for far too long."" In December 2022, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ for a non-binding ""advisory opinion"" on the ""legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem."" While any ICJ opinion would be non-binding, it comes amid mounting international legal pressure on Israel over the war in Gaza sparked by the brutal October 7 Hamas attacks. The hearings are separate from a high-profile case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocidal acts during the current Gaza offensive. The ICJ ruled in that case in January that Israel must do everything in its power to prevent genocide and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire. On Friday, it rejected South Africa's bid to impose additional measures on Israel, but reiterated the need to carry out the ruling in full. The UN General Assembly has asked the ICJ to consider two questions. Firstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called ""the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination"". This relates to the ""prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967"" and ""measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem"". In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. Israel then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory. The UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal. Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel. The ICJ has also been asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's ""adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures."" Secondly, the ICJ should advise on how Israel's actions ""affect the legal status of the occupation"" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries. The court will rule ""urgently"" on the affair, probably by the end of the year. The ICJ rules in disputes between states and its judgements are binding although it has little means to enforce them. However, in this case, the opinion it issues will be non-binding although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon. The ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia. It also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down. Israel is not participating in the hearings and reacted angrily to the 2022 UN request, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it ""despicable"" and ""disgraceful"". Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that while advisory opinions are non-binding, ""they can carry great moral and legal authority"" and can eventually be inscribed in international law.

AG seeks harsher bail conditions for youths in gang attack,Matthew Xuereb,"The attorney general’s office has asked the court to impose harsher bail conditions on the five girls and a boy who allegedly ganged up against a 16-year-old boy, robbing him of cash and stabbing him with a penknife in a Floriana public garden. In an urgent application filed before the Court of Appeal, the AG asked the court to amend the bail conditions especially since the alleged victim had not yet testified.  Last Tuesday, the group, aged between 14 and 20, were charged in court after they were identified as the alleged aggressors behind the mugging that took place on the previous Saturday evening at around 7pm at a public garden just outside City Gate. Police from the Valletta station found the victim lying on the ground, with visible injuries to his face and hands.  He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sustained cut ligaments in his hands. His injuries were classified as grievous. The group appeared before Magistrate Joseph Mifsud charged with grievously injuring the victim and wilfully breaching the public peace.  The 14-year-old boy and five females – one aged 17 from Paola, two sisters aged 14 and 15 from Gżira, a 15-year-old from Valletta and 20-year-old Aicha Mariah from Paola – all pleaded not guilty.  Three of the girls were charged with aggravated theft while the 20-year-old was separately charged with unlawful possession of the penknife as well as relapsing.  The alleged victim was not only attacked but also robbed of his bag, containing some €90 in cash. The court upheld a request for bail by defence lawyers Franco Debono, Francesca Zarb, Adreana Zammit, Ishmael Psaila, Dustin Camilleri and Alexia Attard against a personal guarantee of €2,000 each, under a curfew between 10pm and 6am, signing the bail book once a week and under strict orders not to approach the victim in any manner.  The prosecution had objected to bail since the victim was still to testify and was still in hospital. But Magistrate Mifsud dismissed their request, stating that although the young offenders deserved a warning, they ought not to be remanded in custody but rather allowed to go back to their studies. In his appeal, attorney general lawyer Kenneth Camilleri said the first court had been “very lenient” with the accused, especially after having ignored the prosecution’s concerns about the strong possibility of tampering with evidence.  He asked the court to vary the conditions by, among others, imposing more onerous and effective financial deterrents as well as imposing a supervision order so the defendants would be followed closely.  A hearing has been set for Monday.  The victim told the police he was attacked by a group of six and identified one of the aggressors as a 14-year-old Maltese boy from Żurrieq.  Working on CCTV footage and information gathered through hours of intensive police work, investigators managed to identify the other five suspects who were tracked down and arrested.  Sources said the alleged victim was an ex-boyfriend of a friend of the co-accused and that there had been some verbal spat before the situation escalated to physical violence.

Man shoots dead 12 relatives in Iran,AFP,"A man killed 12 of his relatives in a rare mass shooting in southern Iran, state media reported Saturday.

‘Please call the police’: environmentalist live-streams Siġġiewi ‘ambush',James Cummings,"A member of an environmental protection group was forced to lock himself in his car after he was ""ambushed"" by people in Siġġiewi.  The incident was caught live on camera as the activist - a member of cleanup group 7R Lifestyle Malta - live-streamed the event to Facebook as it unfolded.  One man could be seen hitting his car and the activist said another had approached it, with him in it, with a rock in hand. A woman could also be heard and seen yelling at the man, as he urged live stream viewers to help him by contacting the police.   The activist said that he went to the area on the outskirts of Siġġiewi to meet a woman who asked to meet to discuss allegations of illegal dumping that 7R Lifestyle Malta had publicised on social media.  ""When I got here, she lured me into this lane and suddenly I was blocked off by a truck,"" the man said on the live stream.     “I am in a public road, and they have blocked me completely.” he said.   “They are keeping me here illegally. Please, please, if you can, call the police. Things are escalating, please, someone come now,” he pleaded.   “Look at the situation we are in.... This is all live, to show what sort of country we are... When you care about the environment you are stuck in this situation.”  The incident happened at around 8am, with the police attending the scene shortly afterwards.   When contacted, a police spokesperson said officers had attended the scene and ordered the vehicles blocking the road to be moved.   All people involved had been taken to the police station in Żebbuġ for questioning and investigations were ongoing, the spokesperson said. 7R Lifestyle Malta is a conservation group that works with the Malta Rangers Unit (MRU) to highlight illegal dumping in natural areas.   MRU rangers are citizens empowered to document and report environmental crimes and work with law enforcement to prosecute such crimes.  Commenting on the incident, the MUR said it “strongly condemmed” the incident, calling it a “planned ambush.”    “Our rangers have for over a year worked closely with the person behind this cleanup group and he has taken on Goliath in the area of Siġġiewi and reported several sites not following regulations, as well as doing endless amounts of cleanups,” the group said in a post on Facebook.   “Five days ago he reported an animal farm to ERA, as he should after seeing what he saw, and today ... when he comes on site a large milk truck is blocking the road, causing a scenario where he is not able to get out of there.”  The MRU said it would increase its patrols in the area following the incident.

Police identified burglary suspect when he wore same clothes to sign bail book,Matthew Xuereb,"A drug addict accused of breaking into an elderly couple’s home was identified when he went to a police station to sign a bail book wearing the same clothes as the burglar. Prosecuting inspector Sarah Zerafa told the court that officers had an inkling that the thief was Joseph Attard when they looked at CCTV footage from the Santa Venera residence and nearby buildings. Officers then checked CCTV footage at the Żejtun police station, where they knew Attard signed a bail book, and realised that the person in both sets of footage was wearing the same clothes. Attard, 38 and from Għaxaq, is pleading not guilty to stealing some €14,000 in cash and other items from the residence. He is currently out and about after having been granted bail four times over different crimes. The last time he was granted bail was at the beginning of February after he was charged with stealing thousands of euros in gold and other items from various homes. Defence lawyer Amadeus Cachia said he was not requesting bail at this stage but asked the court to order that his client be kept at the Mount Carmel Hospital forensic unit, since he had an acute drug addiction.  Magistrate Monica Vella recommended that the director of the Corradino Correctional Facility give the defendant the assistance he needs while he is in custody. The prosecution asked the court to issue a protection order in favour of the alleged victims of his crime, which request was granted.

German 'Maddie' suspect in court on unrelated sex crime charges,AFP,"The prime suspect in the long-unsolved case of missing British toddler Madeleine McCann will go on trial in Germany on Friday charged with a host of unrelated sex crimes. The 47-year-old German, identified by authorities as Christian B., was revealed as a suspect in June 2020. It was a major bombshell for the ""Maddie"" investigation, one of the highest-profile missing persons cases in history. Friday's highly anticipated trial opening will mark the first time he has appeared in public since then. German prosecutors have yet to charge Christian B. over Madeleine's disappearance, but in October 2022 he was charged with five separate counts of rape and child sex abuse allegedly committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. The charges came about as a direct result of investigations into the ""Maddie"" case, Christian Wolters, a spokesman for the prosecution in Brunswick, told AFP. Christian B. is already behind bars in Germany for raping a 72-year-old US tourist in 2005 in Praia da Luz -- the same Portuguese seaside resort where Maddie went missing two years later. If found guilty in the new trial, he could face another sentence of between five and 15 years, a spokeswoman for the court in Brunswick told AFP. However, if cleared, he could be freed from jail as soon as 2026, according to Wolters. The trial will last around four months with 29 hearings in total, according to the court. Three-year-old Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve region in May 2007 while her parents dined at a nearby tapas bar. Despite a huge international manhunt and global media attention, no trace of her has been found and no one has been charged over her disappearance. German prosecutors have said they have ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, but the case has since rumbled on without any major breakthroughs. Investigations are continuing in the Maddie case, Wolters told AFP, but ""it is currently unclear whether charges will be filed or not"". In the trial opening on Friday, Christian B. has been charged with two child sex offences and three rapes. In one case, he is accused of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old German girl on a beach in April 2007, just weeks before Madeleine McCann went missing. In another, prosecutors say he exposed himself in front of an 11-year-old Portuguese girl at a playground. He is also accused of sexually assaulting two women and a teenage girl and filming the incidents. In one case, prosecutors accuse him of entering the holiday apartment of a woman aged between 70 and 80, tying her up and raping and beating her. In the second, he is said to have tied a girl aged around 14 to a wooden post in his own home in Portugal, beat her with a whip and forced her to perform sexual acts. In the third, he is accused of entering a young woman's apartment via her balcony in 2004 while she was sleeping, threatening her with a knife and raping her several times. Prosecutors had previously said that the victim was a 20-year-old Irish woman. Evidence in the trial will include witness statements as well as notebooks seized from Christian B., according to Wolters. Handwritten notes and sketches in the notebooks offer insights into ""his sexual fantasies"", he said. The trial and the Maddie investigation share common witnesses, Wolters added, but ""other than that, they are completely separate procedures"". Christian B.'s lawyer, Friedrich Fuelscher, said his client was planning to initially remain silent during his defence, but this ""does not mean (he) has anything to hide"". ""The prosecution is on shaky ground with regard to all the charges,"" Fuelscher told AFP. If he gets a fair trial, Christian B. ""can only be acquitted"", Fuelscher said. ""However, ensuring a fair trial will also be the greatest difficulty of this trial: the media's prejudgement of the accused is unprecedented,"" he said.

"Paceville murder victim served three jail sentences in two countries, court told",Matthew Xuereb,"A man who was stabbed to death in Paceville had served jail time for violent crime in two other countries, a court heard on Thursday. Police Inspector Kurt Zahra told the court that Joseff Rivas was sentenced to jail on three separate occasions in his home countries, Romania and the United Kingdom – in 2007, 2010 and 2017. He was jailed for 27 months in 2007, three years in 2010 and four years in 2017 for robbery and grievous bodily harm.  Rivas was stabbed in Paceville on December 5, 2022, during a knife fight allegedly triggered by a row over prostitution. The case concerns a violent incident that broke out in broad daylight when Rivas and two other men approached the trio who were having a drink outside a cafeteria on Ross Street. An argument ensued over some prostitution-related earnings and the situation escalated into a full-blown fight during which Rivas was fatally stabbed. The victim was a suspected member of a Romanian criminal group, allegedly sent to kill the three accused, believed to be “pimps”, a court previously heard. Rivas was stabbed “20 or more” times, with forensic pathologists saying that three of those blows proved fatal. Romanian nationals Ilie Constantin and his cousins, brothers Ionut Iulian Tanase and Dan Andrei Tanase, deny his wilful homicide. They are arguing that they acted in self-defence. Zahra took the witness stand during the compilation of evidence against the three men to present a detailed conviction sheet pertaining to Rivas.  According to information obtained from police in Romania and the UK, where Rivas resided, all his convictions were related to the same crimes – offences against the person and grievous bodily harm. Zahra said that the list did not feature any pending cases but he said there were no alerts when he searched the victim’s name in the police database. A police officer from the Rapid Intervention Unit testified about finding the victim lying on the pavement and unresponsive, with blood oozing out of his back and neck.  RELATED STORIES  The court on Thursday also heard testimonies of scene of crime officers who described how they were assigned to take photographs of the scene as well as two searches in apartments in St Julian’s and Marsascala, from where they took blood samples and passed them on to the court-appointed experts for DNA testing. In the kitchen of the St Julian’s apartment, officers found, photographed and seized a wet grey hoodie from inside a bin, as well as a knife found on the kitchen sink. These were also sent for testing.  The case, presided over by magistrate Astrid May Grima, continues. AG lawyers Kaylie Bonnet and Darlene Grima prosecuted, together with Inspectors Kurt Zahra and Brian Xuereb. Lawyers Franco Debono, Charmaine Cherrett, Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"One dead, children among 21 injured in Super Bowl parade shooting",AFP,"One person was killed and children were among the 21 injured after a mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl victory rally on Wednesday triggered panic among huge crowds of fans. Shots rang out moments after jubilant Chiefs players addressed a vast, cheering crowd, sending shocked fans and VIPs fleeing in a tragic end to what had been a joyous morning of celebrating the NFL champions. Police said three people had been taken into custody after the attack near Kansas City's Union Station, but the motive behind the shooting was still under investigation.   Fire department chief Ross Grundyson told a press conference that many of the victims had sustained ""life-threatening injuries"". A local DJ, Lisa Lopez, was killed in the assault, her radio station said. ""This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC Community,"" KKFI posted on its Facebook page, referring to Kansas City.  Children's Mercy Hospital said it was treating 12 people - 11 of them children, nine for gunshot wounds - after the shooting. A hospital spokesman said all were expected to recover.    Paul Contreras, who was at the rally with his three daughters, said he tackled and disarmed one of the suspected shooters before the police arrived. ""I got the right angle on him and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve,"" Contreras said on CNN. ""I take him down, and I'm putting all my body weight on him. And then another good Samaritan comes over and is helping me."" Victims were treated lying on the ground before being carried away on stretchers amid the commotion and the crowds, while the hundreds of police guarding the event rushed to clear the area. Chiefs star Travis Kelce said he was ""heartbroken"". ""My heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Praying for Kansas City,"" quarterback Patrick Mahomes wrote on social media, while a statement from the team said they were ""truly saddened by the senseless act of violence"".   US President Joe Biden issued a rallying call for Americans to back his pleas for Congress to enact gun reform, saying Wednesday's shooting ""cuts deep."" ""Today's events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting,"" Biden said in a White House statement. He called on Americans to ""make your voice heard in Congress so we finally act to ban assault weapons, to limit high-capacity magazines, strengthen background checks, keep guns out of the hands of those who have no business owning them or handling them."" Just moments before the shooting, Kelce and his teammates had been soaking up the adulation from a sea of red-shirted fans. There had been no hint of trouble as hundreds of thousands of partying supporters feted Chiefs players along a two-mile (three-kilometre) route in a procession of double-decker buses, enveloped by a blizzard of red and gold confetti. Local officials said more than one million people were expected for the parade, which was held in unseasonably sunny, warm conditions in downtown Kansas City. Mass shootings are common in the United States, where there are more guns than people and about a third of adults own a firearm.  The attack in Kansas City wasn't even the only shooting to grab national headlines Wednesday: four students were also shot outside an Atlanta high school, while three police officers were shot during a standoff in the capital Washington. All are expected to survive, according to media reports.  The shootings came six years to the day after 17 people were killed in an attack at a high school in Parkland, Florida. ""There is something so depressingly American about experiencing a mass shooting at a Super Bowl celebration on the anniversary of another mass shooting,"" posted March For Our Lives, a student-led advocacy group seeking gun control that formed after that shooting in Parkland, a suburb of Miami. Polls show a majority of Americans favor stricter gun regulations, the powerful firearms lobby and mobilized voters supporting the country's culture of strong gun rights have repeatedly stymied lawmakers from acting.  The Chiefs were celebrating their third Super Bowl title in five seasons after beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas on Sunday. The team's most famous fan - music superstar Taylor Swift, whose relationship with beau Kelce has become a cultural phenomenon - was not part of the celebrations. She was reportedly en route to Australia, where she is due to perform in Melbourne on Friday. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Jeremie Camilleri plea deal 'not taken lightly', court told as sentence date set",Edwina Brincat,"A man who admitted the murder of Pelin Kaya just over a year ago will be sentenced in March. Jeremie Camilleri, had denied the murder of the 30-year-old interior designer on Testaferrata Street, Gżira, on January 18 2023 but last week changed his plea to guilty.  Camilleri ran over the Turkish woman, who was a stranger to him, in his BMW car and then pelted stones at her body.  On Tuesday, Camilleri appeared before the Criminal Court where Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera took note of a joint application by the prosecution and the defence stating that a plea deal had been reached.    “It was not taken lightly. Negotiations went on for months with the Attorney General and the victim’s lawyers, who are also present in court,” explained defence lawyer Alfred Abela.  “You know that the court is not bound to abide by those terms,” pointed out the judge.  The parties said that they did. They did not reveal in court the punishment that had been agreed between them. “The victim was killed in a macabre manner,” said Attorney General lawyer Kaylie Bonett, adding further that negotiations had gone on for months and the final punishment agreed upon had taken note of all circumstances of the case.  One of those circumstances was the fact that the bill of indictment had not yet been issued when Camilleri registered an admission, pointed out Abela.  After hearing all parties confirm their agreement on the terms of the sentence bargaining, the court put off the case to March 5 for judgment to be delivered.  AG lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Nathaniel Falzon prosecuted.Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin were defence counsel.Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi, Charlon Gouder and Ramona Attard are appearing parte civile.

'The first step to closure' - families of Sliema murdered couple,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The families of a couple murdered in their Sleima home in 2020 said the news that one of the alleged killers will plead guilty in exchange for a 40-year prison sentence was ""the first step towards closure"". ""Hopefully, this conclusion is the first step in bringing closure, although nothing can be done to bring the loved ones back,"" Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski- the brothers of murdered men, Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski- told Times of Malta  yesterday. ""Needless to say, we now look forward to the swift closure of all three cases pending trial."" Pandolfino and Maciejowski were murdered inside their Locker Street home in August 2020. One of the three men awaiting trial for the Sliema double murder- Jesper Kristiansen- admitted the murder in court on Monday after agreeing to a plea deal. Kristiansen, a Danish national, had fled Malta following the murder but was arrested 10 days later in Spain, after the Spanish police tracked him down in Cadiz, and extradited him to Malta to face criminal charges.  The other two men facing murder charges in the case are Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national Viktor Dragomanski. Prosecutors opted to charge the three separately but yesterday informed the criminal court that the three had been put together under one joint bill of indictment. That meant Kristiansen, Dragomanski and Muka were to stand trial together. However, Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras noted a joint note filed by the prosecution and Kristiansen's defence team, which said that the parties had agreed on the terms of a plea bargain.  The court was informed that Kristiansen would enter a guilty plea against the agreed punishment of 40 years and his share of court expenses. The accused, assisted by lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto, confirmed that he understood the implications of that note.  AG lawyer Kevin Valletta then asked for the separation of proceedings, meaning that Dragomanski and Muka would part company with Kristiansen. The request was upheld. Kristiansen is expected to formally confirm his plea at another sitting in the near future.  Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison if found guilty. Once his plea deal is formalised, he will also be able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta is prosecuting. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto are counsel to Kristiansen. Lawyers Joe Giglio and Michaela Giglio are appearing parte civile. The families of the murdered couple also thanked the police, the courts, the attorney general's office, and their parte civile lawyers ""for their hard work to solve and bring these terrible murders to justice"". Last October, the two brothers had lamented court delays, telling Times of Malta that they were ""devastated"" and ""extremely disappointed"" at how one of the other alleged killers- Muka- had his trial postponed to April.  Back then they had said the families ""all desperately needed closure"" and that delays added ""unnecessary heartache"".

Man allegedly shot by son refuses to testify,Matthew Xuereb,"A man has been cleared of shooting his father after he refused to testify against his son. Peter Azzopardi told Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace that he did not want to testify against his son Steven, 37, who stood charged with trying to kill him, threatening him and attempting extortion. The shooting incident took place outside their home in Għargħur in April 2018 when a family dispute over property heated up. The father was shot in the shoulder in a field just off Sqaq it-Xaqquf and his son was arrested shortly afterwards. Despite having a 0.22mm bullet lodged in his right shoulder, the injuries were classified as slight in nature. The accused, Steven Azzopardi, was granted bail upon arraignment, pleading his innocence from the beginning. The firearm was never found. During the first session of the compilation of evidence a week after the shooting, Peter Azzopardi declared under oath that he did not want to testify against his son and that he had since forgiven him. His declaration meant the prosecution had to do without the testimony of the sole eyewitness of the alleged crime.   According to the Criminal Code, an alleged victim of an offence involving domestic violence may request the court to stay proceedings against the alleged perpetrator but the court may decide to carry on, considering the best interests of the complainant, any minors involved, and any other relevant third parties. The Attorney General’s office insisted that the case must continue and the accused must face a trial by jury. The compilation of evidence continued for six years, until all other prosecution witnesses testified, including police officers, scene-of-crime officers, forensic officers, court-appointed experts, medical and ballistic experts. When the prosecution rested its case on Friday, defence lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri asked the court to stay proceedings, insisting that if the prosecution’s only eyewitness was still refusing to testify, going before a jury was going to be a futile exercise. Magistrate Micallef Stafrace upheld the request, ruling that it was amply clear that Peter Azzopardi, even in the presence of his lawyer, wanted the case against his son to stop here. She therefore ruled that the case against Steven Azzopardi had been extinguished and cleared him of all the charges brought against him. Police Inspector Roderick Spiteri prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. Lawyer David Gatt appeared parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Court throws out breach of rights claim by one of Europe's most wanted fugitives,Edwina Brincat,"A court has thrown out a breach of rights claim by convicted explosives importer Jomic Calleja Maatouk, currently still one of Europe’s most wanted fugitives.  The man was handed a five-year effective term of imprisonment last July, in a judgment handed down by a Magistrates’ Court, describing him as a “lethal weapon” ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk appealed that decision and was out on bail pending final judgment. However, soon after, Calleja and his wife went missing. The couple were subsequently targeted by a European Arrest Warrant and placed on Europol’s list of most wanted fugitives.  While criminal proceedings against him were still pending before the Magistrates’ Courts, Calleja Maatouk had flagged a constitutional issue concerning the disclosure of information by the prosecution.  Police had pressed charges against him for allegedly importing explosives purchased on the dark web after obtaining intelligence pointing investigators in his direction.  When asked how that information had been obtained from the dark web, superintendent George Cremona had testified that “it was irrelevant”.  The presiding Magistrate agreed, pointing out that if that information was police intelligence, then the superintendent could not testify about it.  The accused’s lawyer asked for full disclosure, but the request was rejected.  A subsequent request for a constitutional reference was also turned down by the court in an “exhaustive and well reasoned” decree delivered by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech in March 2022 which concluded that the request was “frivolous and vexatious.”  That was when Calleja Maatouk filed separate constitutional proceedings claiming that the lack of full disclosure breached the accused’s fundamental rights.  The relative provision under the Criminal Court regulating disclosure did not provide “an independent mechanism”. Rather than have the court decide whether a particular piece of information was intelligence or otherwise, the matter was placed in the hands of the police and the Attorney General who were interested parties in the proceedings.  Calleja Maatouk’s lawyer referred to the more “just and fair” procedure adopted under the US and Dutch systems when compared to the system adopted under Maltese law, arguing that the latter was defective.  There were “blatant loopholes” which resulted in a breach of the accused’s fundamental rights, argued lawyer Benjamin Valenzia.  Such lack of full disclosure meant that Calleja Maatouk could not provide a valid defence.  When delivering judgment on Monday, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction observed that the issue which formed the subject matter of the case was “identical” to that which had been decreed upon by the Magistrates’ Court.  Yet, even though the Magistrate had concluded that the claim was “simply frivolous and vexatious”, Calleja Maatouk had proceeded with separate constitutional proceedings.  Citing case law on this matter, Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey concluded that the applicant’s claim was null, declaring that the court would not pronounce itself on a matter that had already been declared “frivolous and vexatious” by another court.

One of three charged with Sliema double murder agrees to 40-year jail term,Edwina Brincat,"One of three men awaiting trial for a double murder in Sliema is to plead guilty after agreeing to a 40-year jail sentence as part of a plea deal. Jesper Kristiansen is one of three men accused of murdering Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski inside their Sliema home in August 2020. Kristiansen, a Danish national, had fled Malta following the murder but was arrested 10 days later in Spain, after Spanish police tracked him down in Cadiz, and extradited him back to Malta to face criminal charges. The other two men facing murder charges in the case are Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national Viktor Dragomanski. Prosecutors opted to charge the three separately but on Monday informed the Criminal Court that the three had been put together under one joint bill of indictment.   That meant Kristiansen, Dragomanski and Muka were to stand trial together.  However, Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras took note of a joint note filed by the prosecution and Kristiansen's defence team, which noted that the parties had agreed on the terms of a plea bargain. The court was informed that Kristiansen would enter a guilty plea against the agreed punishment of 40 years and his share of court expenses.  The accused, assisted by lawyers Stefano Filletti and Roberto Montalto, confirmed that he understood the implications of that note.  AG lawyer Kevin Valletta then asked for the separation of proceedings, meaning that Dragomanski and Muka would part company with Kristiansen.  That request was upheld.  Kristiansen is expected to formally confirm his plea at another sitting in the near future.  Had he gone to trial, Kristiansen could have faced up to life in prison if found guilty. Once his plea deal is formalised, he will also be able to testify against his co-accused without the fear of self-incrimination. AG lawyer Kevin Valletta is prosecuting.

Iran sentences man to death over killing prominent filmmaker,AFP,"An Iranian court has sentenced a man to death over the killing of renowned filmmaker Dariush Mehrjui and his wife months ago at their home near Tehran, the judiciary said Monday. Mehrjui, an 83-year-old director associated with the Iranian new wave of cinema, was stabbed to death along with his wife Vahideh Mohammadifar in October at their home in Karaj, west of the Iranian capital. The convicted killer, who was arrested days after the attack, was a former employee of Mehrjui who “had a grudge against the deceased due to financial issues”, the chief justice of Alborz province, Hossein Fazeli-Harikandi, said previously. Three others were charged in the case over their roles in planning and assisting the murder, he added. On Monday, the Judiciary’s Mizan Online website said the court sentenced the killer to death in accordance with the Islamic law of retribution, known as the “qisas” law. He was found guilty of the “premeditated murder of Mehrjui and Mohammadifar”, Mizan quoted Fazeli-Harikandi as saying. He added that the application of the retribution law came at the request of Mehrjui’s family. The other defendants received sentences ranging from eight to 36 years in prison, according to Fazeli-Harikandi. The verdicts, however, are not final and can be appealed before the Supreme Court, Mizan added. Following Mehrjui’s death, tributes poured in to celebrate the works of the pioneer director, producer and screenwriter, who during his six-decade career was confronted by censorship both before and after the Islamic revolution of 1979. The director was best known for his 1969 metaphorical drama The Cow as well as his 1990 dark comedy Hamou” showing 24 hours in the life of an intellectual tormented by divorce and psychological anxieties.

Malta and the mob: how the Italian mafia came to view Malta as a second home,| Neville Borg and Nicholas Debono Drury,"Antonio Ciavarello’s arrest in Mosta on a nondescript Thursday morning brought Malta’s role as the hideout of choice for mafia bosses and henchmen back into the spotlight. Ciavarello is the son-in-law of notorious Sicilian mafia boss Totó Riina, once the head of the Corleone clan immortalised by Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather trilogy.   But Ciavarello is only the latest in a long line of mobsters linked to Italian or Sicilian mafia clans found to be hiding in Malta over the years. Riina himself was known to be a frequent visitor to Gozo, often spotted in St Francis Square in Victoria. Like many others before him, Ciavarello successfully kept a low profile in Malta, avoiding run-ins with the police and dutifully reporting for his day job as a driver with a construction company. Some of his predecessors had gone to greater lengths to hide their identities. Sebastiano Brunno, the head of the Nardo clan of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, was arrested to great acclaim in 2014 after five years on the run. Brunno had been living under a false identity, going by the fanciful name of Natale La Modica, even producing a fake Italian ID card when approached by police moments before his arrest as he was on his way to lunch in a Buġibba restaurant. Seemingly unperturbed by the prospect of years behind bars, Brunno reportedly congratulated police as he was being handcuffed, telling them “well done, you found me”. He is currently serving a life sentence for the 1992 murder of a man called Nicolò Agnello.  Sebastiano Brunno, head of the Nardo clan of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, was arrested in Buġibba to great acclaim in 2014 after five years on the run.   Earlier in the same year, Aldo Gionta, a member of the Neapolitan Camorra, was caught by Italian police in Pozzallo as he attempted to board a ferry to Malta. Gionta was known to be somewhat of a maverick, often taking to wearing wigs and even cross-dressing in his attempts to evade authorities. Known as the “poet boss”, thanks to his penchant for penning poems while in lockup, Gionta was wanted by police for hiring his own brother to kill a man who had slapped his 14-year-old son, after the boy had thrown an egg at him during carnival celebrations. Simone Gaetano, believed to be a member of the Stidda mafia clan, was making the opposite ferry journey from Malta to Pozzallo in September 2019, only to find Sicilian police waiting patiently for him as he disembarked. Countless others, from Cosa Nostra mobster Giuseppe Arcaria to Francesca Rispoli, daughter of the notorious ’Ndrangheta boss Vincenzo Rispoli, were captured either while travelling to or hiding in Malta, or, in the case of the latter, after organising what police described as an extortion beating in Marsascala.  Stories in Times of Malta about Mafia links to the country.    Carlo Bonini, deputy editor-in-chief of La Repubblica, thinks that the mafiosi caught in Malta throughout the years are only the tip of the iceberg. “In reality, nobody really knows how many people are hiding in Malta,” he told Times of Malta. The mob’s presence in Malta’s criminal underworld is spread across several notorious mafia families, each having cornered a part of the market. According to DIA, Italy’s anti-mafia agency, Cosa Nostra is particularly active in the drug trade, with the ’Ndrangheta and Santapaolo-Ercolano families mostly opera­ting in gambling and betting circles. A major police operation in 2021, codenamed ‘Operation La Vallette’, uncovered how mob operators smuggled some 430kg of cannabis and cocaine from Puglia to Malta. With the help of their local contact, a man named John Spiteri, the drugs were hidden inside a fruit and vegetable shop in Attard. This came shortly after businessman Antonio Ricci was arrested in Malta for his alleged links to a €60m online gaming racket. He had been suspected of ties with the 'Ndrangheta mafia although his lawyers insist that his only pending issues in Italy relate to whether he should pay his taxes in Malta or Italy.   Online gambling and sports betting are proving to be increasingly fertile ground for the mafia in Malta. In 2021, Catania police found that several Maltese companies were being used by the Santapaola-Ercolano clan to evade some €30m in taxes from online bets. The question remains – what is it that makes Malta so attractive to the mafia? DIA, Italy’s anti-mafia agency, believe that it is a combination of several factors. First and foremost, Malta’s geographical proximity to Italy and Sicily, together with its EU membership, has meant that “in recent years the presence of Italian organised crime has increased” across the island. Secondly, Malta’s “particularly favourable tax regime” and its low corporate tax make it ideally placed for the mob’s money laundering activities.   DIA director Giuseppe Governale argues that it ultimately boils down to a simple equation: “The mafia has always had great vision, it has always carried out a cost-benefit analysis: in short, it goes where GDP grows and where anti-mafia legislation is reduced or less effective.” Malta, with its decade-long economic boom and historically lax approach to white-collar crime, fits Governale’s description like a glove. Carlo Bonini agrees. He says that it is an open secret that hundreds of Italian professionals use Malta to hide or launder their money, often by opening companies and benefitting from low taxes. “If regular people do it, why wouldn’t organised crime?”, he asks. Bonini also thinks that the types of industries that have thrived in Malta in recent years, from real estate to online gaming, are particularly susceptible to money laundering activities. Malta’s police force, Bonini adds, is often less equipped to track down mafia members on the run, compared to their Italian counterparts. “These people are used to hiding from dedicated anti-mafia agencies and police with specialised training in the field,” he told Times of Malta. Hiding from Maltese police, by comparison, is seen as more straightforward. But authorities say that coordination between Maltese and Italian law enforcement has been stepped up to tackle these criminals. In a LinkedIn post shortly after Ciavarello’s arrest, crimi­nologist and head of the Malta Gaming Authority’s financial crime compliance unit Antonio Abdilla Zerafa said that although the geographical proximity between Malta and Italy increases the chances of criminal gangs settling in Malta, the “sustained and effective collaboration bet­ween the law enforcement agencies of both nations has consistently facilitated the apprehension of high-profile criminal figures and the confiscation of illicit assets”.

'Feliċ will have two days of fame': Man tells friends he shared viral sex video,Edwina Brincat,"A man accused of filming a fellow diner having sex with a woman at the Luqa boċċi club allegedly owned up to sharing the video without the couple’s consent but shrugged it off saying “Feliċ will have his two days of fame”.  Mark Cachia Zammit, a 35-year-old delivery man from Birżebbuġa, posted that comment in a Messenger group chat after a video of a sex scene, filmed during an evening meal, went viral on Facebook.  The whole episode landed Cachia Zammit in court  facing criminal charges as the prime suspect behind the filming and non-consensual sharing of the footage, with his table companions being summoned as eyewitnesses.  Cachia Zammit’s lawyers are claiming that he lacked criminal intent since he never meant to harm the alleged victims who had “tacitly consented” to the filming.  When the proceedings resumed this week, two of the accused’s friends who witnessed the unfolding of events that evening both appeared to agree that Feliċ “did what he did freely” and appeared to “enjoy the attention” of his table companions.  One of the witnesses recalled arriving last at the venue that September evening. He had been invited along by Cachia Zammit and when he got there, the rest of the group were already seated, waiting for dinner to be served.  Feliċ and the woman were sitting next to each other “chatting normally”. Grabbing a drink at the bar, he waited until starters were followed by the main course and then joined the others at the table, sitting at one end, facing the bar.  “Everybody was chatting in smaller groups at the table,” explained the witness, who said that he was on his mobile phone while eating. He suddenly heard shouting.  “Feliċ and the woman were dancing intimately with their clothes on... Feliċ was enjoying the attention he was getting,” as others at the table egged him on, he explained. The couple returned to their seats and but went back to their dancing, their movements “getting more and more intimate”.  “Feliċ appeared to be holding back while she egged him on, removing his clothes,” said the witness, stressing that at that moment he chose to focus on his food.  The woman led Feliċ towards a billiards table, that had been shifted to make space for their gathering, “and they had sex there” to shouts of “come on Feliċ! You’re king!”. The witness was not pleased with the unexpected turn of events.  “I went there to eat and ended up in all this. I had thought it would just be a meal, a drink and then back home. I have a girlfriend,” explained the witness, annoyed by the hassle that the meal with friends had landed him in.  Another eyewitness testified that the couple “seemed to know each other”. The woman - a stranger to the witness - had allegedly joined the party of male friends on their way into the club.  “They ended up entwined (gew kobba), hugging and kissing,” said the witness. And as the situation grew more intimate, so did the comments.  Asked who was behind those comments, the witness said that he “recognised the voice of Mark Cachia Zammit”.  Given the angle of filming of the video which ended up on social media, the witness claimed that the person filming must have been Cachia Zammit.  When the footage went viral the following morning, those present at the meal were shocked and confronted the accused about it, court heard. “All reached the same conclusion that he had filmed it,” said the witness. Later, the accused allegedly admitted his mistake in a group chat among friends, but shrugged it off saying: “Feliċ will have his two days of fame"". During the sexual episode, the bar owner had ordered the couple to stop, telling them to “go outside or go to the bathroom”.  But when his orders were ignored multiple times, he closed the entrance to the club and went back to his cooking.  Questioned about the couple at the centre of attention, the witness said “Feliċ did what he did freely. No one forced him"". Moreover, he seemed to be aware that he was being filmed because “he began to pose and wave, conscious of the filming”.  “What about the woman,” asked the prosecutor. “She too,” came the reply.  Cross-examined by defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, the witness confirmed that he too was holding his mobile phone at the time of the incident.  He was scrolling casually because, after a while, he lost interest in what was going on around him. “Were you on a video call?” pressed on Azzopardi.  “Yes, because someone called me and I answered. He [the caller] asked: ‘what’s all that noise?’ And I hung up.”  The case, presided over by Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia, continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Kurt Farrugia are prosecuting.

Teens plead guilty to breaking into their headmaster’s safe,Edwina Brincat,"Three teens who admitted to breaking into a safe inside their headmaster’s office, stealing cash and two model cars, were granted bail pending sentencing by the juvenile court.  Their mischievous plan landed the 14-year-olds, a UK-born girl, a Polish boy and an Italian boy, in deep trouble and ultimately in court. On Friday afternoon, they pleaded guilty to the solitary charge of theft aggravated by means and value. The students were tracked down as the suspects who broke into the principal’s office at the middle school they attended and forced open a safe.  The suspected theft took place between February 2 and 5.  Although initially it was thought that some €8,000 was missing, the actual amount stolen was subsequently confirmed as falling between €3,000 and €5,000. Two model cars were also stolen.  Working on CCTV footage as well as information gathered from the school, police soon tracked down the suspected thieves. A magisterial search and arrest warrant was issued on Thursday and early on Friday morning police set about executing the arrests. By 7.30 am all three suspects were in police custody.  They were questioned separately, with each giving the same version of events.  They all collaborated and there was “no nonsense,” said prosecuting inspector Clayton Camilleri when giving an overview of the events leading to the arraignment.  It also resulted that the teens realised their mistake and had a change of heart, returning the items to their school, where they were subsequently spotted by a security guard. In court, the three students sat quietly, evidently nervous in the unfamiliar environment of the courtroom, with their parents and a social worker sitting closely behind them.  Assisted by their lawyers, the youngsters registered an admission which they confirmed after presiding Magistrate Joseph Gatt suspended the hearing for a while, giving them the chance to speak to the lawyers and reconsider their plea.  “Guilty,” all three repeated, each one in turn, when asked a second time by the magistrate.  “This was a very stupid mistake. Let’s admit that,” said the Magistrate, as all three nodded in agreement.  “Make sure you never come back here. You’re 14. You’ll sit for your exams soon…..You made a mistake, a serious one and hopefully the only one. Now [focus on ] books, books,” advised the Magistrate, his warning backed up by the defence team.  The prosecution and the defence filed a joint note explaining that in the circumstances a term of probation would be the appropriate punishment. The defence further requested a pre-sentencing report.  The court pointed out that despite their admission being registered at the earliest stage, the teens would have to be handed a sentence by another magistrate presiding over the juvenile court.  The current system of assignment of magisterial duties does not allow for a duty magistrate to deliver judgment in respect of minors, even if there is an admission. Defence lawyer and Chamber of Advocates president Peter Fenech, who was assisting one of the teens, pointed out that the system needed to change to cut down on “useless” dragged-out proceedings, especially in such cases where minors are involved.  The court then upheld a request for bail against a €200 deposit for each of the teens, promptly paid out by their parents in court.  The court also issued a ban on the names of the minors, the school as well as the headmaster who was present at the arraignment. The youngsters approached their school head right after the hearing and apologized for their misdeeds. AG lawyer Giuliana Magro Conti and inspectors Clayton Camilleri, Andrew Agius Bonello and Joseph Mallia prosecuted. Lawyers Peter Fenech and Elena Fenech, Noel Bianco and Sylvana Brannon assisted the teens respectively. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Woman spared 15-month jail term over wrong bail book location,Matthew Xuereb,"A woman has been spared 15 months in jail and indefinite detention over a separate case after a court found that the bail book she was convicted of failing to sign was at a different police station than the one mentioned in the charge sheet. Charlene Gatt, 37 from St Paul’s Bay, was convicted of having failed to sign the bail book as part of her bail conditions over a case in which she stood charged with allegedly hitting her female neighbour with a meat mallet. The court heard how she suddenly stopped signing the bail book between October 2021 and February 2022 when she was finally rearrested and charged with breach of bail. She was jailed for nine months and a six-month suspended sentence was brought into effect. The court had also ordered her detention until her case is decided as well as the revocation of a €5,000 bail bond. But presiding over her appeal, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera noted that the first court could have never found her guilty of failing to sign the bail book at the Żebbuġ police station because the bail decree presented in court by the prosecution stated that the bail book was at the police station in Paola. On the basis of this alone, the court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against Gatt. Moreover, the court observed that from testimonies of experts who knew Gatt, including a family doctor who had known her for at least 15 years, the woman had problems that would be better addressed outside jail. She was a single mother who was battling a drug addiction, among other problems. Madam Justice Scerri Herrera said that Gatt would be better off outside jail, where she can be followed closely by a probation officer and other experts who can help her get her life back on the right track. She therefore cleared her of the charges and overturned the effective jail term imposed by the first court. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Another three men charged over Ħamrun brawl,Edwina Brincat,"Three men, who allegedly triggered a massive brawl in Ħamrun earlier this week, were remanded in custody upon arraignment on Friday afternoon.  Ibrahim Flej, 33, Ismael Rajih, 32 and Kacem Al Flieg, 23, all sharing the same Qormi address, were escorted to court after being tracked down over their alleged involvement in the “big commotion” that broke out at around 1 pm on Tuesday.  Two Syrian brothers, Saoud and Naief Mahmoud, were arraigned on Thursday and were also denied bail.  Today, the court heard how last Tuesday, officers at the Ħamrun police station heard a lot of shouting outside.  They went out to check and saw many people rushing in one direction.  Heading in that direction, a short distance away from the station, the policemen came across a “large scale commotion,” with people locked in a scuffle.  Four men were arrested and escorted to the police station for questioning.  Two of them were subsequently released.  The other two, who bore visible signs of injury, were taken to the polyclinic, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa.  Footage from the scene of the brawl led to the identification of three other suspects, namely the trio arraigned on Friday.  They had arrived in Ħamrun in a van which they parked some way off from the site where the incident took place.  They stepped out of the vehicle and lingered nearby, apparently waiting. Then suddenly, all three dashed in the direction of the area where the fight broke out.  That footage did not capture the fight but at one point, Ibrahim returned to the van, drew out a piece of wood and headed back in the direction of the fight scene. That wooden object was the same one police seized when they stepped in to break up the fight, the prosecutor said.  The suspected trio were arrested and interrogated. On Friday they pleaded not guilty to slightly injuring Saoud, inciting a gathering of ten or more persons, actively participating in that crowd, speaking foul or indecent language in public and wilful breach of public peace.  The defence requested bail, arguing that these were summary charges carrying a punishment which did not exceed two years imprisonment.  The accused had untainted criminal records, a fixed address and jobs. Moreover, there was no risk of tampering with evidence since the alleged victims were currently in jail, under preventive custody, argued lawyer Frank Anthony Tabone.  The prosecution objected since the alleged victims and other eyewitnesses were still to testify.  Saoud was initially reluctant to tell police that he had suffered the blows.  The brawl appeared to have stemmed from some unresolved issue regarding payments related to work that the parties had undertaken.  Saoud did not even want to go to the polyclinic at first, but later explained that he had received the first blow on the head from Ibrahim. Parte civile lawyer Matthew Xuereb pointed out that there were civilian witnesses, including a veteran lawyer and Saoud’s partner, who were still to testify.  His clients had been charged when they were the victims, said the lawyer.  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Gatt, turned down the request for bail given the nature of the charges and the fact that civilians were still to testify. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri were defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Maltese man to be extradited to US as prime suspect in FBI malware investigation,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 1.35pm A Maltese man will be extradited to the US as part of an FBI investigation into the sale of illegal malware on the dark web. Daniel Joe Meli, 27, from Żabbar was also allegedly involved in mentoring services on a hacking forum, according to police. The malware is known as RAT - or remote access trojan - and is used by criminals to gain access to and control computers and servers. Several US victims have fallen prey to RAT, with no reported victims in Malta so far, the police added. A search and arrest warrant for Meli, a check-in agent, was issued by a magistrate on Tuesday. On Facebook, he says he works for Aviaserve and previously worked at Air Malta.  The investigations in Malta were led by the Cybercrime Unit following a request for assistance by the US authorities, which believe that the prime suspect in the sale of malware is Maltese. According to investigations by the local police, Meli was working with other people who were not Maltese and did not live here. He was arrested at his place of work in Gudja on February 7. Several items linked to the investigation were confiscated from places owned by the suspect. He was escorted to court, where Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday kicked off the extradition procedure. Meli consented to the extradition and is being kept at the Corradino Correctional Facility in the meantime. His lawyer, Joe Giglio, invoked the rule of speciality, meaning that he was to be extradited to answer only for the charges indicated in the relative documentation.  A Nigerian accomplice was arrested in Nigeria, while investigations led by Europol are ongoing in Austria, Canada, Croatia, Finland, The Netherlands, Romania, Germany and Nigeria. Inspectors Dr Mario Cuschieri and Robinson Mifsud prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Man admits to sexual harassment at workplace,Edwina Brincat,"A man pleaded guilty to sexually harassing a co-worker by touching her breast, later sending her an apology through Facebook Messenger. Ernest Assumang Kumi, a 47-year-old Nigerian national living in Birżebuġa, was targeted by criminal action for committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature and following a course of conduct which amounted to harassment.  Prosecuting Inspector Wayne Bonello said the incident took place last November at the company’s Qormi offices. The victim filed a report a few weeks later in December. The woman told police that on the day of the harassment, the accused approached her to speak to her about his plans to move abroad, asking about his wages.  While the woman was talking to him, discussing his payslip, he suddenly touched her breast, saying: “I can’t stay away from your breast”. The woman pushed him away, shielding herself against the unwelcome advances while the man passed some further indecent comments. She told him to go away and he did.  Later, he sent her a Facebook message apologising for his behaviour. An arrest warrant was issued against the suspect but it could not be executed since he was abroad.  He was arrested on Wednesday as soon as he returned to Malta, explained the prosecutor.  Assisted by a legal aid lawyer, the man registered an admission. Asked by presiding magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil whether he fully understood the charges, the accused said: “It was a mistake. I touched her breast. But we talk to each other all the time.”  Given more time to consult his lawyer and reconsider his plea, the accused confirmed his admission.  Parte civile lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin said that on Wednesday the accused had filed a report against the victim alleging “some sort of touching from the back”.  However, in light of his admission on Thursday, the defence said that that report was to be withdrawn by the accused.  The parties agreed that a maximum term of probation, coupled with a protection order, would be appropriate punishment in the circumstances.  The victim would be spared re-living the incident and would not be called to testify, explained her lawyers.  Moreover, the accused had filed an early guilty plea, had cooperated with the police and apologised for his wrongdoing.  The court put off the case for judgment on Monday and upheld the defence’s request for bail against a deposit of €500, a personal guarantee of €1,000, signing the bail book daily until Monday and not approaching the victim or other witnesses in any manner.  The court also issued a ban on the victim’s name and issued a protection order in her regard, warning the accused of the consequences if he were to breach that order.  AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli and Inspector Wayne Bonello prosecuted.  Lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant was legal aid counsel. Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin appeared parte civile.

German libraries up defences against far-right attack,AFP,"Defaced and destroyed, books torn up and political messages scrawled across their pages: the evidence of an alleged far-right vandalism spree at a city library in Berlin covers an entire table. “The first reaction was confusion, then outrage, when we realised what had happened here,” Boryano Rickum, chief librarian for Tempelhof-Schoeneberg district, told AFP.  The incident – the work of a single suspect – was not, however, a one-off.  The library at Berlin’s Technical University is also thought to have been targeted by far-right vandalism, while elsewhere extremists have crashed events and threatened staff.   The cases illustrate what campaigners call a “cultural struggle” as extremist ideas gain purchase and the far-right climbs in the polls. The increased threat has prompted efforts to better arm public spaces against attack and protect them as a space for dialogue. Staff at the library in well-heeled Tempelhof-Schoenberg were used to finding the odd scribbled swastika but the vandalism crossed a line, said Rickum. Destroying books was, in his eyes, tantamount to an “attack on democracy”.  “The moment we discovered the damage, it was clear that we couldn’t just go back to business-as-usual.” Critical censorship The topics dealt with in the books gave some indication of the possible motivation: the history of feminism, critical analyses of far-right groups and the autobiographies of prominent green politicians. “We had to assume that it was an attempt to prevent a critical discussion of right-wing extremism and National Socialism,” said Rickum.  Acts of violence against books have a particular resonance in Germany, where the Nazis, who ruled up to 1945, ceremonially burnt publications they deemed to be subversive or deviant.   The acts of radical censorship are commemorated in central Berlin on Bebelplatz, the site of such a bonfire in the 1930s. In recent times, many cultural institutions have had run-ins with extremists, said Bianca Klose from MBR, an advisory group, which offers help dealing with the far-right.  “But now we’ve noticed that in particular public libraries are increasingly noticing a so-called cultural struggle from the right,” said Klose. By targeting libraries, “the extremist right is trying to change the boundaries of what can be said”, according to Klose, whose organisation printed a pamphlet with advice for librarians last year.   The publication details confrontations with the far right, such as threats made last year against a reading to children by two drag queens at a Munich library. With a growing number of elected officials, the far-right AfD party was “trying to use political power to gain influence over libraries”, Klose said. The party’s representatives used their positions to ask “why certain books are not in collections”, notably ones from right-wing publishing houses, sometimes framed as a matter of political neutrality. ‘The right place’ The pamphlet offers best-practice solutions: how to establish guidelines, how to decide what books to stock and ways to contextualise content in libraries. In Tempelhof-Schoeneberg, the library’s response has been to “put the focus on the books affected”, said Rickum.  Many of the authors of the vandalised books have been invited to discuss their ideas and the staff has established a reading group around the issue.    Federico Quadrelli, 37, a volunteer who leads the group, sees it as “a space where people can meet and talk about important, current, political topics”. The suspected vandal at the Tempelhof-Schoeneberg library, a man in his early thirties from Berlin, has been charged with damaging property. The aim of the attack was to limit debate, said Rickum. “We want to achieve the opposite, namely that people assess it critically.” “Democracy needs a place where people can come together... and we think this is the right place,” he said. “Of course, I also know that as a library we cannot do this alone. We need civil society to save democracy.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Son-in-law of mafia boss Totò Riina arrested in Malta,Edwina Brincat,"Updated 4.01pm The son-in-law of late Sicilian mafia boss Totò Riina has been arrested in Malta and has consented to his extradition to Italy. Antonino Ciavarello was arrested in Mosta early on Thursday morning, a day after his 50th birthday, on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued in Italy. The police said in a statement the Italian authorities issued the warrant on January 24, 2022.  The 50-year-old is wanted by the Brindisi Public Prosecutor's Office to serve a prison sentence after having been convicted of fraud and breach of police bail. Ciavarallo is married to the daughter of Salvatore “Totò” Riina, a notorious Sicilian mafia boss, who led the Corleonesi clan immortalised in the Godfather films. Nicknamed the 'beast' because of his cruelty and known as 'the boss of bosses' of the mafia, he targeted his crimial rivals in the 1980s and 90s as well as journalists, prosecutors and judges who got in his way.  One of Italy's most feared mobsters, he died in a prison hospital bed in 2017 while serving 26 life sentences and was believed to have ordered the killing of more than 150 men. His most famous victim was Giovanni Falcone, an anti-mafia judge murdered in a car bomb in 1992.    Palermo-born Ciavarello was taken to court on Thursday afternoon and immediately consented to his extradition. Assisted by an interpreter and seated throughout the hearing after complaining of leg pains, he said that he worked as a driver with a local company. His legal aid lawyer explained that the accused was aware of the sentences in his regard but did not know that they were effective. He never had any issues with police or authorities in Malta and had only once landed a fine. Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil confirmed with the prosecution that the man had no pending judicial proceedings in Malta and upon his consent, remitted him into custody pending his extradition. Prosecuting inspector Roderick Spiteri presented documentation including correspondence with Italian counterparts confirming that the wanted man’s fingerprints matched those of the person arrested today. The forensic laboratory had tested Ciavarello's fingerprints after his arrest. Lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant was legal aid counsel.

EU agrees first law on combatting violence against women,AFP,"EU member countries and lawmakers reached an agreement on Tuesday on the bloc's first rules to tackle violence against women, the European Parliament and officials said. The law seeks to protect women in the 27-nation European Union from gender-based violence, forced marriages, female genital mutilation and online harassment. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, first proposed the major legislation on March 8, 2022, to mark International Women's Day. ""It's a clear message across the union that we take violence against women seriously,"" EU lawmaker Frances Fitzgerald told reporters in Strasbourg after the announcement. ""It is a directive that the women and girls all across the European Union have asked for for over 30 years,"" another lawmaker, Evin Incir of Sweden, said. ""For the first time ever, we criminalise widespread forms of cyberviolence, such as non-consensual sharing of intimate images,"" Vera Jourova, European Commission vice president for values and transparency, said on social media. The text criminalises cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyber incitement to hatred or violence across the European Union. It does not, however, include a common definition of rape, which proved to be the most controversial point in negotiations. ""We could not get consent-based definition of rape into this directive. So that is a very big disappointment,"" Fitzgerald said. Although the text does not contain a definition of rape, member states will aim to raise awareness that non-consensual sex is considered a criminal offence, the parliament said in a statement. The commission will have to report every five years on whether the rules need to be updated, it added. The parliament and at least a dozen EU countries including Belgium, Greece and Italy had wanted to include a definition of rape. But a dozen other countries, including France, Germany and Hungary, opposed doing so, arguing the EU had no competence in the matter. The states in opposition argued that rape does not have the cross-border dimension, necessary for it to be considered a crime that comes with common penalties in the bloc. The parliament and the commission strongly disputed that position, insisting that rape could fall within the framework of ""sexual exploitation of women"", for which there is already a joint set of penalties.  The reluctance to agree a definition of rape sparked controversy in France, where President Emmanuel Macron had said tackling violence against women would be a priority of his second term. Macron had already elicited criticism after defending the presumption of innocence for Gerard Depardieu, who has been charged with rape and sexual harassment.

Men caught red handed by police in foiled armed hold-up denied bail,Edwina Brincat,"Two armed robbers, allegedly caught in the act by policemen patrolling St Paul’s Bay streets in the early hours of Monday morning, were remanded in custody upon arraignment.  Mitchel Buhagiar, a 33-year-old sales manager, and Konrad Cassar, a 47-year-old water leaks technician, both from St Paul’s Bay, were caught red-handed while allegedly attempting to rob a supermarket store in Triq il-Maskli at around 3 am.  Three police officers patrolling the area were alerted by the commotion which led them to the store where they spotted two masked and armed men holding up the female cashier and a male shop worker, prosecuting Inspector Clayton Camilleri explained. One of the men carried a knife while the other had a screwdriver-like instrument which later turned out to be a sharpening tool.  When foiled, one of the suspects immediately cooperated and lay face down on the floor. But his partner in crime tried to escape, heading to the toilets and stores at the back of the supermarket where he was subsequently arrested.  The pair were jointly charged with attempted aggravated theft, unlawfully holding the two victims against their will, causing them to fear violence, as well as wilfully breaching the public peace.  Both were also charged with relapsing.  Buhagiar was separately charged with slightly injuring the male shop worker by putting the knife to his back, failing to obey legitimate police orders, wilful damage to third-party property as well as breaching bail.  They pleaded not guilty.  Assisted by legal aid lawyers, both accused requested bail.  Buhagiar had a fixed job and there was no fear of absconding. He has a drug problem and wished to start a rehabilitation programme, lawyer Alexia Vassallo argued. Cassar was also a drug addict who wished to reform himself. He had a fixed address and job and the convictions on his conduct sheet related to offences dating back ten years. The request was objected to by the prosecution in both cases.  The accused were caught red-handed and were armed while carrying out a crime against the person. Both men were untrustworthy and their criminal record offered no peace of mind, AG lawyer Claire Sammut countered.  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request. Buhagiar had already been afforded an opportunity when granted bail in separate proceedings, observed the court. Moreover the fear of tampering with evidence, the need to protect third parties and serious doubts as to the accused’s trustworthiness led the court to deny bail.  As for Cassar, the court observed that the accused was masked when attempting the hold-up, thus indicating that the crime was planned and that the accused tried to hide away from justice.  Although he cooperated when arrested, there were eyewitnesses who still had to testify.  The court also issued a Protection Order in respect of the alleged victims, including the two workers and shop owners.  AG lawyer Claire Sammut and Inspector Clayton Camilleri prosecuted.

"PL MEP candidate asks police to investigate man over Muscat, Abela 'hate speech'",Times of Malta,"Updated 3pm with Robert Aquilina comment A Labour MEP candidate has asked the police to investigate a man who insulted Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela on Facebook for hate speech. Daniel Attard filed a police report on Tuesday morning, arguing that Godfrey Leone Ganado had breached Article 82A of the Criminal Code in two comments he published online on Monday. Leone Ganado wrote of Muscat and Abela that he hoped “the unexplained wealth they accumulated off our backs will crumble to dust and bury them together with their families in a pit of smelly shit”.  In a subsequent comment, he added: “When dealing with this trash you need to call a spade a spade, and after all, you need a spade to lift shit”. Leone Ganado posted those comments beneath a post published by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina. Aquilina said he dissociated himself and Repubblika from the comments and Leone Ganado, and that he had deleted the comments as soon as he became aware of them.  The comments drew criticism from various quarters on social media, and on Tuesday morning Attard said he wanted Leone Ganado, whom he described as “part of the extremist Repubblika clique”, prosecuted. “I will insist on action being taken against anyone who thinks they are above the law, and to ensure justice is equal for all,” Attard said following his criminal report.   Leone Ganado is no stranger to controversy: in 2020 he lost a libel suit after he likened MP Rosianne Cutajar to a prostitute. “Hamalli, prostitutes and call girls have a right to be represented in parliament,” he wrote of the Qormi MP. A magistrate ruled that the comment impinged on Cutajar’s reputation and ordered Leone Ganado to pay her €800 in damages. Repubblika president Robert Aquilina clarified on Tuesday afternoon that Leone Ganado was not a member of Repubblika. He quit the association after  being threatened with expulsion when he made similar comments in the past, Aquilina said.

Perfume thieves get a conditional discharge,Edwina Brincat,"Two men have been conditionally discharged after admitting to stealing almost €300 worth of perfumes from a pharmacy in St Julian’s last month. Marius Fanel Galan, 36, staying at St Julian’s, and 40-year-old driver George Bigu, from Swieqi, were arrested after being tracked down as the suspects behind the theft that allegedly took place on January 26, some time between 5:00pm and 8:30pm. Galan said that he had been on holiday in Malta for a week. The pair were jointly charged with stealing perfumes and other items from the pharmacy.  The theft was aggravated by the value of the items stolen and the time when the incident took place. They registered an admission when they were arraigned on Monday and confirmed their guilty plea after the court granted them time to reconsider, warning that the charge carried a possible jail term.  When making submissions on punishment their lawyer, Franco Debono, highlighted the accused’s clean criminal record, the fact that they had cooperated with police and had apologized for their wrongdoing. Moreover, they registered an early guilty plea and were willing to reimburse the pharmacy owner for the €295 worth of perfumes and other items stolen. The circumstances of the case did not even merit a suspended sentence, argued the lawyer. However prosecuting Inspector Jonathan Ransley called for a suspended sentence, pointing out that one of the accused said that he came to Malta as a tourist but ended up stealing. After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, declared the two men guilty upon their own admission and conditionally discharged them for two years. AG lawyer Andreas Vella and Inspector Jonathan Ransley prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.

‘The wait is killing us’: Chantelle Chetcuti's sister on pain of pending trial,Jessica Arena,"The sister of murder victim Chantelle Chetcuti has spoken out about the pain of her alleged killer’s trial remaining unresolved, despite four years having passed since the crime.  Chantelle’s sister, Stacey Camilleri, opened up about the family’s calvary on the anniversary of her sister’s death and said the family is unable to live in peace for as long as justice remains unserved.  “Four years must be more than enough for a case like this to close! The wait is killing us!” Camilleri said in a Facebook post.  She said that while the family is doing its best to move on, fully processing their grief has stalled because the man accused of Chantelle’s murder, whom they believe is responsible for her death, continues to live freely out on bail “as if nothing ever happened”.  “We are not asking for the world,” she said.  Chantelle Chetcuti was fatally stabbed outside a Żabbar club on February 2, 2020 while out having a drink with a friend.  Her former partner and father of her children Justin Borg is accused of her murder. He is pleading not guilty to the charges and is currently out on bail while proceedings against him continue.  Camilleri emphasised the toll that the whole ordeal has had on her sister's two young children.   “The lives of these two children have changed forever, our lives changed forever and a part of me died with you that day,” she said.  She also alleged that Borg had turned up outside her late mother's house after being released on bail, and said that had further added to their anguish.  “We didn’t even get the chance to grieve properly, how could we when he started to appear in places where, if he had any sense of decency, we would never have seen him,” she continued.  Their mother had since died, Camilleri said.  ""Our mother went from bad to worst until she left this world,"" she wrote. ""She didnt deserve to spend her last years on this earth in agony.""  RELATED STORIES  Camilleri said it is a shame that despite the evidence, proceedings against Borg have yet to be concluded.  “He has his rights, they say, of course he has his rights, but what about our rights?” she continued.  “I cannot understand why this man is still free. Peace cannot exist where justice is not served.”  Chatelle Chetcuti’s family is not the only one who has spoken up about their pain being exacerbated by lengthy court proceedings.  The family of Paulina Dembska, who was killed in Sliema in 2022, have also expressed how the family has been left unable to mourn as judgment against their sister’s alleged killer remains in limbo.   “I can only say that the case is taking too long. We all know who took the life of our sister,” her brother Łukasz Dembski told Times of Malta, saying he was left with the impression that the accused received more psychological help from the authorities than his family has.

Environment watchdog condemns illegal dumping for social media clout,Times of Malta,"The Environment and Resources Authority has condemned videos appearing to show people dumping electronic waste in a quarry, seemingly for entertainment.  Such irresponsible behaviour, seemingly enacted for social media clout, is deplorable, ERA said in a statement on Friday. Images provided by the authority appear to show a person throwing an old CRT television into a quarry, possibly within the limits of Dingli, as the Dingli Radar features in the background of one image.   “These actions are detrimental to the environment because this type of waste contains dangerous materials like mercury that can lead to the contamination of groundwater,” ERA said.  “It is also detrimental to third parties and betrays a lack of civic responsibility.”  The authority said it is working with the police to find the people responsible and hold them accountable for their actions.

"Trio arrested after road stop yields cocaine, cannabis and magic mushrooms",Edwina Brincat,"Three men caught with a mix of drugs inside their car, when flagged down in a roadblock earlier this week, were denied bail after pleading not guilty to drug-related charges.  The drugs were discovered during random police checks that were being carried out in Paola on Monday, explained prosecutors who arraigned Adam El-Haddoudi, 37, Jaeckel Tamas, 38 and Gabor Gyorgy Rusz, 35, all Hungarian nationals.  When the car they were driving was flagged down and pulled aside, police spoke to Tamas who was the only English speaker among the trio.  A search of the vehicle yielded a mix of drugs on the front side, and under the floorboard.  All three men were placed under arrest and given their legal rights, said prosecuting Inspector Paul Camilleri.  A magisterial inquiry kicked off and a scientific expert was appointed to certify the nature and amounts of the suspected illicit substances.  Inside various bags and tubes, there were 4 grams of cocaine, 91 grams of cannabis grass, 90 grams of cannabis resin, 12 grams of psilocybin (magic mushrooms), 12 Viagra pills and 11 ecstasy pills.  Some €2000 in cash was found in one of the men’s possession. The other two suspects had minimal sums of cash.  Right up to their arraignment, police were unable to determine where any of the three accused lived. Tamas’ health records listed two addresses, one in San Ġwann and another in Attard, but he no longer lived there and refused to disclose his address to the police.  The other two men claimed that they were in Malta on holiday, but did not tell police where they were staying.  Among the bags of substances, police had also discovered a tracking device.  Additionally, while the drugs were being removed from the vehicle, an officer had allegedly noticed a car zooming past, going past the Mosque towards the roundabout and back, circling the area several times.  The number plate of that other vehicle was not recorded.  All three accused pleaded not guilty.  Lawyer Jose’ Herrera, assisting El Haddoudi, questioned whether police had determined who the drugs belonged to. “Can you tell whether the drugs were his or not? If you find drugs on a bus, do you arrest all the people on the bus?” the lawyer argued. He also pointed out that his client had a fixed address in Malta and a pending job offer.  Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting the other two co-accused, backed up that argument as well as the fact that the amounts of substances were small, describing them as “drug court territory.”  After hearing submissions the court, presided over by magistrate Charmaine Galea, turned down the request.  Inspectors Paul Camilleri, Kurt Farrugia and Antonello Magri prosecuted.  Lawyer Jose’ Herrera was counsel to El-Haddoudi.  Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were counsel to the other two accused. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Fugitive boss of 'most violent' Italian mafia arrested in Corsica ,AFP,"A boss from one of Italy's most violent mafias who escaped from a maximum security prison last year has been captured in France, authorities in both countries said on Friday. Marco Raduano, described as ""dangerous"" on Europol's list of Europe's most wanted criminals, was detained on the French island of Corsica. He had escaped from a heavily secured prison in Nuoro, Sardinia, in February 2023, using bedsheets to scale down the walls.  Authorities in Italy also announced on Friday the detention of his close aide, Gianluigi Troiano, another fugitive who had been picked up near Granada in southern Spain. ""The carabinieri's (police's) capture abroad of two dangerous fugitives, Marco Raduano and his right-hand man Gianluigi Troiano, represents another major blow to organised crime,"" Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said. Raduano, 40, was jailed for being the boss of the rural Gargano clan operating within a young and little-known organised crime syndicate in Foggia, in the southern Italian region of Puglia, known as the Fourth Mafia. He had been serving a 24-year prison sentence for membership of a criminal organisation, drug trafficking, holding illegal weapons and other crimes, according to Europol. Europol said he was ""at the top"" of his criminal organisation, ""with the role of promoter, organiser and ruthless killer of the group dedicated to the perpetration of murders, drug trafficking and management of the extortion racket"". A source close to the matter in Corsica told AFP that Raduano was arrested on Thursday evening in Aleria, as he was dining in a restaurant with a young woman. He had been living there ""quite frugally"" on false papers, using a falsely registered stolen vehicle, the source said. He did not resist his arrest. Raduano's escape was hugely embarrassing for Italian authorities and underscored the power of the Fourth Mafia, today considered Italy's most violent organised crime syndicate. Troiano, an ""underboss and organiser"", had escaped from house arrest not far from Foggia in September 2021, Italian police said. He was found in Otura, a small town near Granada, and will now have to serve a sentence of nine years and two months in prison, they said. Raduano is also accused of the murder of two men in Foggia in separate incidents in 2017 - with Troiano also implicated in the latter. The judicial process is ongoing. Piantedosi thanked the French and Spanish authorities for their cooperation in allowing Italian police to ""close the net"" on the two fugitives. Less sophisticated than the wealthy 'Ndrangheta, the Naples-based Camorra or Sicily's Cosa Nostra, the Foggia clans rely on extortions, bombings and threats to locals. They are also engaged in drug trafficking, armed robberies, and vehicle and livestock theft.        You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Teens steal rental vehicle from airport car park,Edwina Brincat,"Two teens who stole a vehicle parked at the Malta International Airport a week ago have been granted bail pending sentencing after admitting to their wrongdoing.  The minors - a 16-year-old from Fgura and a 17-year-old from Xghajra, both Maltese nationals - were arrested after being identified through CCTV footage.  The theft was reported last Thursday between 3pm and 5pm when a Ford Focus model owned by a car hire company went missing.  On Wednesday, one of the teens was recognised when he returned to the airport. Further investigation led to the arrest of the second suspect.  Police also found clothes that allegedly matched those worn by the suspects on the day when the car was stolen, the court was told on Thursday.  The youngsters were jointly charged with aggravated theft, as well as driving without a licence and third-party insurance cover.  The stolen vehicle was subsequently retrieved.  They both registered an admission and their lawyers requested the court to order a pre-sentencing report.  The court upheld that request as well as an additional request for bail against a personal guarantee of €10,000 each. The accused were ordered to sign the bail book twice a week and to abide by a curfew.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Victor George Axiak, ordered a ban on the publication of the minors’ names.  AG lawyer Alessia Schembri, together with inspectors Karl Roberts and Roxanne Tabone prosecuted.  Lawyers Alfred Abela, Rene’ Darmanin and Ludvic Caruana were defence counsel.

Roderick Cassar’s lawyers seek to suspend murder proceedings,Edwina Brincat,"Roderick Cassar’s lawyers are seeking to suspend criminal proceedings over the murder of his wife until his constitutional challenge against the recently introduced femicide law is definitively settled.  The unexpected twist on Wednesday saw Cassar’s lawyers informing the judge presiding over his constitutional case that they were filing an application requesting an interim measure. That measure would effectively suspend the criminal proceedings wherein Cassar stands accused of the wilful murder of his estranged wife, Bernice, who was assaulted and shot outside her workplace in November 2022. Cassar is pleading not guilty.  Those murder proceedings at compilation stage before the Magistrates’ Court are currently at a very advanced stage, with the bill of indictment expected in the near future.  The bill of indictment would pave the path to the accused’s trial.  Pending the murder proceedings, Cassar’s lawyers filed a separate case before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction claiming that the recent amendments introducing the concept of femicide as an aggravating factor of wilful homicide, breached the accused’s fundamental rights.  They are arguing that the new law did not only introduce the notion of femicide but also did away with the plea of ‘sudden passion.’ Once the murder qualified as femicide, that mitigating factor was “categorically excluded” even if it was proved that the accused acted under sudden passion or was in a state of mental agitation.  Cassar’s lawyers thus argued that the new law was highly discriminatory, sexist and totally counter productive and breached the accused’s right to a fair hearing.  In their latest application for an interim measure the lawyers argued that the outcome of the constitutional case undoubtedly impacted the outcome of the murder proceedings. For that reason it would be wise at this advanced stage of the criminal process to stay (suspend) those proceedings until the constitutional proceedings ran their full course.  Faced with that information, Madam Justice Anna Felice granted Cassar’s lawyers one week to file their request and to serve notification thereof to the other parties.  Within that week, they were also to indicate whether they had any further evidence to produce in the constitutional case.  Such interim measure, if upheld, would likely delay the issuing of the bill of indictment by the Attorney General.  The case continues.  Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi, Marion Camilleri and Jacob Magri are assisting Cassar.Lawyer Julian Farrugia is representing the State Advocate.Lawyers Marita Pace Dimech, Rodianne Sciberras and Ann Marie Cutajar are appearing on behalf of the victim’s family who intervened in the proceedings.

"Three teenagers admit involvement in Mosta garden mugging, granted bail",Edwina Brincat,"Three teenagers have been granted bail after admitting they were involved in a mugging at a public garden outside the Mosta Mcast campus. The trio, a 15-year-old and two 16-year-olds, were all charged on Wednesday before magistrate Charmaine Galea. Prosecuting Inspector Stephen Gulia told court on Wednesday the police were alerted to the aggression at Ġnien L-Għarusa in Mosta on January 24 at around noon.  A 22-year-old student was robbed of his laptop by two of the accused. The victim gave chase, caught up with them and wrestled the laptop out of their hands.  The aggressors punched the student in the face and although he got back his laptop, the muggers fled the scene.  The student filed a police report and was escorted to the health centre where his injuries were certified as grievous because they needed suturing.  Police investigations kicked off and two of the suspects were identified through CCTV footage.  Their faces were not masked. One of the muggers and another teen who acted as a lookout during the aggression were the first to be identified, explained Gulia.  The third suspect was soon identified through other footage and information supplied by his alleged partners in crime.  All three were arraigned on Wednesday afternoon. The first to be arraigned were a 16-year-old unemployed Maltese national and a 15-year-old Syrian student - both from St Paul's Bay. They registered an admission to aggravated theft, grievous bodily harm, causing fear of violence, insulting, threatening and assaulting the victim as well as wilful breach of peace. The court, presided over by Magistrate Charmaine Galea gave them time to reconsider, warning that the charges carried a possible five-year jail term.  Punishment would be delivered by the juvenile court after a pre-sentencing court report is drawn up. A request for bail was not objected to by the prosecution as long as conditions reflected the ""most serious nature of the crimes."" They were granted bail on condition they do not approach the victim and keep away from the Mosta MCAST campus, signing the bail book twice weekly, a curfew lasting from 11pm and 6am and under a personal guarantee of €5,000 each. Magistrate Galea warned them of the consequences if they were to breach any of those conditions. The court issued a protection order in favour of the victim too. The third teen - a 16-year-old Moroccan student also from St Paul's Bay - was charged with complicity in the mugging by acting as a lookout.  He too pleaded guilty and was granted time to reconsider. He was also granted bail, with the imposed conditions prohibiting him from going to school since he is a student at the MCAST campus. The court imposed a ban on the aggressors' names and a protection order in respect of the victim. AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov together with Inspectors Stephen Gulia and Godwin Scerri prosecuted.  Lawyers Jacob Magri and Arthur Azzopardi are counsel to one of the 16-year-olds. Lawyers Jose' Herrera, Alex Scerri Herrera and Matthew Xuereb assisted the other 16-year-old. A legal aid lawyer assisted the 15-year-old.

Officials unaware how many workers were at Jean Paul Sofia collapse site,Edwina Brincat,"The developers, contractor and architect involved in the Corradino building collapse that killed Jean Paul Sofia in December 2022 were “totally oblivious” of the number of workers on site when the tragedy struck, a court heard on Wednesday. ""No one could tell us the exact number” Assistant Commissioner Kenneth Haber testified as he recounted the scene he witnessed shortly after the building came crashing down during construction works. The police were initially told that “some six workers” were involved, the officer recalled during the compilation of evidence against developers Matthew Schembri and Kurt Buhagiar, project architect Adriana Zammit and contractors Milomar and Dijana Jovicevic. All five are pleading not guilty to the involuntary homicide of 20-year old Jean Paul Sofia who was buried alive under the rubble.   Haber said the site was a hive of activity when he got there, with civil protection officers and paramedics engaged in the rescue operation. Some men were pulled out from the rubble “all covered in concrete,” and the primary task was to determine the number of persons who had been on the site and to account for everyone. But that proved to be difficult. Police and rescue workers spoke to the developers, the architect and the contractor but no one could give the exact number.    Questioned further by parte civile lawyer Joe Giglio whether the accused were in a position to give a head count of those on site at the time of the incident, Haber replied in the negative. “No one was aware of what was going on or the number of persons on site. They were totally oblivious. And I must say that they were also somewhat panicked, to be fair. But we could not get to a number. They could not supply that information.” At one point somebody pointed to a parked van close to the accident site. When police opened that vehicle they found a wallet with the ID card of Jean Paul Sofia inside.   Haber said the police started a triangulation process to locate Sofia’s mobile phone. One of the workers on site, not one of the accused, told the police that Sofia was not one of the workers applying concrete that day, but could have entered the site prior to the collapse.  The case, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Antonello Magri are prosecuting. Lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell is counsel to Zammit. Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are counsel to the developers. Lawyer Timothy Bartolo is counsel to the contractors.

Parliament extends pre-trial arrest period for serious crime,Daniel Ellul,"People suspected of serious crimes can now be held in custody for up to four days before being charged with a crime after both sides of the House voted to double the maximum period of pre-trial arrest for serious crimes. As it stands, police can hold someone suspected of a crime under arrest for up to 48 hours before charging criminally.  But following Tuesday's vote, anyone suspected of a serious crime with a penalty of over 12 years in prison can be held for a further 48 hours following an order by a magistrate.  That change will come into effect after the President signs off on the law. The government initially suggested allowing the police to hold a person suspected of a serious crime for an additional 84 hours, but PN MPs Carm Mifsud Bonnici and Mario de Marco expressed concern about tripling the maximum period of pre-trial arrest. Support from the Government and the Opposition was needed to vote this law through as it will involve amending the constitution, which requires two-thirds of the House's support.  In a statement, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the change will provide more effective tools for police ""The applicability of this law should be the exception and not the rule. This is a law that also reflects steps taken in other countries to respond to complex crimes that have developed over the years,"" he said. “We want to continue working for a society where everyone, without any distinction, is accountable for their actions but we also want to ensure that the laws respect the fundamental rights and the need for an objective justification for the measures that are taken. These are two important pieces of legislation in the work being carried out for a more efficient and effective justice and the fight against crime.” The House also amended legislation in relation to proceeds of crime on Tuesday limiting the amount of assets frozen and eventually confiscated on the amount suspected to have been acquired through an illicit activity. Currently, someone accused of a financial crime can have most of their property seized by the court.  The new law aims to proportionalize the assets frozen by the court with the crime someone is being investigated or accused of.  The law relates to financial crime, and legislation on freezing orders related to drug trafficking will not change.  The PN voted against these amendments. Earlier this month, the party said the limit on freezing orders should not apply to those accused of corruption. In comments to Times of Malta, Shadow Justice Minister Karol Aquilina said that the PN had tried to amend the law to not include people accused of corruption three times, but the government refused each time.  The new laws will be advantageous for people accused of serious crimes as the onus of proof that assets were acquired through crime will now be on the prosecution, he said.  “That is especially hard to do when there is money laundering,” Aquilina said.  He claimed that the law was fast-tracked with the intention to protect people close to the government who are or will be accused of financial crime.

Employee denies injuring drunk customer in kebab shop punch-up,Edwina Brincat,"A kebab shop employee who allegedly punched a drunken customer who refused to leave, landing him in critical condition, was granted bail upon arraignment on Tuesday.  Fawzi Khalifa, the 20-year-old son of an Egyptian kebab shop owner, was arrested as the suspect behind the violent incident that resulted in the victim, a 45-year-old Ukrainian national, being found unconscious in Triq Gulju in St Paul’s Bay. The alleged aggressor was on Tuesday charged with causing the victim grievous injuries which left him in critical condition as well as wilfully breaching the public peace during the incident which took place at around 10 pm. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. His defence team argued that the alleged victim, who was heavily drunk at the time, had refused to leave the shop when asked to by the accused.  That was when an argument broke out.  The accused allegedly punched the drunken man who fell to the ground. The injured man was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance and was admitted into intensive care. He has since been transferred out of the intensive therapy unit, the court was told.  The accused’s lawyers requested bail, arguing that the injuries sustained by the alleged victim were partially caused by the fall.  The court was also told that the victim’s blood alcohol level was 307mg/dl.  After hearing submissions on bail the court, presided over by magistrate Nadine Sant Lia, upheld the request against a deposit of €3,000, a personal guarantee of €7,000 and daily signing of the bail book. The court also issued a protection order in respect of the victim, warning the accused that he was not to approach any of the prosecution witnesses, including the alleged victim.  AG lawyers Maria Meilaq Schembri and Claire Sammut prosecuted together with Inspector Bernard Charles Spiteri.  Lawyers Mario Mifsud, Nicholas Mifsud, Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin were defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Man arrested after police search yields cannabis plants, €15,000 in cash",Times of Malta,"A 44-year-old man was arrested after police found a “considerable” number of cannabis plants growing in his home.  The police said in a statement on Tuesday that they went to look for the Tarxien resident after a person filed a police report at the Żabbar police station about items allegedly going missing from their home. That person named the 44-year-old as one of the people who could have been responsible for their theft.    Police said they went looking for the man and later accompanied him to his home in Tarxien. This is where officers said they found a “considerable” number of cannabis plants being cultivated on the property. In pictures sent by the police’s communications office, several mature plants, saplings and a large jar of dried cannabis plants appear to have been found at the site.  The search also yielded some €15,000 in cash from the Tarxien home.    Duty magistrate Rachel Montebello was informed of the find and ordered an inquiry to be opened.

Man with ‘zero involvement’ in Paqpaqli crash cleared after seven years,Edwina Brincat,"A motorsport enthusiast has been cleared of all criminal responsibility for the ill-fated 2015 Paqpaqli għall-Istrina charity event, with the court declaring the man’s involvement “a big fat zero” seven years after he was charged. “I had nothing to do with it. I was never in the core committee… I got to know some of the other co-accused here in court,” Jonathan Tonna told the court, adding he had initially thought the charges were “some joke”. He was one of the five co-accused, of the original group of 13, still facing charges over the incident in which motoring enthusiast Paul Bailey’s Porsche 918 Spyder spun out of control and crashed into the crowd. About 26 spectators were injured, some critically. The following year, members of the organising committee, together with the supercar driver, were charged with involuntary harm to victims and damage to third party property following a magisterial inquiry into the incident. They were also sued before the civil courts for damages. Criminal proceedings were assigned to Magistrate Victor George Axiak after former Magistrate Aaron Bugeja was elevated to judge. Last October, Bailey registered an admission and was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service. One of the organisers, Angelo Manara, also registered an admission and was ordered to perform 200 hours of community work. Two months later, another six members of the core committee pleaded guilty and each was handed 200 hours of community service, plus one-thirteenth share in court expenses.   Tonna was involved in the annual charity event up to 2013 representing Island Cars Club, which used to organise its own motoring event at another site. The club last participated in Paqpaqli in 2014. The following year the club decided not to hold the event because there were too few entries. In 2015, Tonna received an email from one of the Paqpaqli organisers, Tonio Cini, asking whether Island Cars Club had a safety plan when organising their own event. “What safety plan?” Tonna replied, explaining that pre-2015 there was no plan. When Paqpaqli was first organised during the presidency of George Abela, safety was handled by his colleague Duncan Barbaro Sant, who gave instructions regarding track design, barriers and how the area was to be fenced off. But after both of them stepped down, Tonna had no further involvement. “That’s where it ended. I’ve been here for seven years and they know it.” He got to know about the Paqpaqli incident through a relative who worked in hospital and who alerted Tonna’s wife about the casualties being rushed to emergency. Months later, then-inspector Josric Mifsud asked Tonna whether he would assist in the magisterial inquiry as court expert. Tonna expressed doubts about his personal qualifications but Mifsud assured him that as a motorsports enthusiast who had organised several motoring events, he was sufficiently experienced to qualify as court expert. Tonna turned down the proposal, sensing a conflict of interest. One of his relatives had been badly injured in the crash and he also knew some of those involved in the event’s organisation. He gave the police officer contact details of a foreign motorsports enthusiast who could provide the necessary expertise. Then two weeks later, he received a call. “The magistrate wants to speak to you,” the caller said. “I thought it was some joke,” Tonna said on the witness stand. He could not answer the inquiring magistrate’s questions because “I had nothing to do with it”. He was questioned about the “previous years” and once the session was over, he headed back home. In 2017, one of the event organizers dropped the bombshell, telling Tonna that he had been named in the case. “Perhaps they have mistaken experts,” he wondered. But he called Mifsud to check, and “he [the police officer] did not seem to know what to say”.   Then court documents began to pour in. “There were 13 civil cases…€14,000 in court expenses,” explained Tonna. The court saga also impacted his wife’s well-being. “I had nothing to do with it. I was never in the core committee,” he insisted when questioned twice by the magistrate. Barbaro Sant also testified that Tonna, together with the majority of the organising team, had stepped down in 2013. After stepping down, Barbaro Sant did not hand over his safety role to anyone and could not tell who took over. Following those testimonies, Magistrate Axiak turned to the prosecution: “Do you still want to press charges against Tonna?” Superintendent Josric Mifsud said that if the other co-accused declared they could not point a finger at Tonna, the prosecution would take a stand. He confirmed he had called Tonna. “Seven years have passed in this case but it’s never too late,” the court observed. “Tonna’s involvement was nil, nothing, a big fat zero. Can we have this declaration today so that this man may reset?” Lawyers for Jonathan Bruno, Agostino Degiorgio, Tonio Cini and Brian Gatt unanimously minuted that Tonna had no involvement whatsoever in the organisation of the 2015 event. The prosecution then requested the separation of proceedings and the court delivered judgment in respect of Tonna, declaring that he “clearly had no involvement of whatever nature in the organisation of the event and had no responsibility for any safety plan”. The court cleared Tonna of all criminal liability. “You may now leave,” said the magistrate, as Tonna left the dock and walked out of the courtroom, visibly relieved. The case continues. Lawyers Michael Sciriha, Lucio Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri were defence counsel to Tonna, Bruno and Cini. Lawyer Raphael Fenech Adami is counsel to Degiorgio. Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli are counsel to Gatt. Lawyer Michael Grech appeared parte civile. Superintendent Mifsud and Inspector Hubert Cini are prosecuting.

Two men arrested in drug investigations,Times of Malta,"Two men were arrested on Saturday for drug-related offences in separate investigations.  A 37-year-old Romanian man was arrested after police caught him with 15 kilograms of a substance suspected to be cocaine while a 36-year-old Serbian man was arrested in connection with an illegal cannabis-growing operation.  The Romanian national was apprehended by police shortly after arriving in Malta from on the catamaran ferry from Sicily.  After searching the man’s vehicle, which was alleged to be carrying packets of cocaine, police discovered 15 kilograms of the substance which had an estimated value of around €2 million.  Police found 15 packages of drugs hidden in false compartments in the Volkswagen Touareg.   Police discovered 15 kilograms of cocaine in the car which had arrived from Sicily. Photo: Office of Communications, Malta Police Force.   In another operation the same day, officers raided a residence in Mellieħa after spending some time observing the property. They discovered more than 150 large cannabis plants and arrested a Serbian man in connection with the case.   The plants were thought to yield around 80 kilograms of cannabis for sale on the streets, with police believing the drugs were meant for the local market.   Two inquiries were opened led by Magistrates Donatella Frendo Dimech and Monica Vella, respectively, who in turn each appointed several court experts.  Police investigations are ongoing.

Paschalino Cefai charged over cocaine find after trying to flee police,Matthew Xuereb,"Paschalino Cefai, notorious for a string of crimes in Gozo, has been charged with aggravated possession of cocaine and with trying to flee the police. The court heard on Saturday how the 44-year-old from Zebbuġ, Gozo was stopped in a car where he was a passenger on January 25 in Marsa. The car, which had heavily tinted windows, had an expired road licence and insurance. The woman was asked to step out of the car but Cefai remained seated in the passenger seat. While the police spoke to the woman driver, Cefai sneaked out of the car, ran to the driver's side and tried to drive off. He was promptly stopped in the act. When the police searched the car, they found 14 grams of cocaine inside a bag in a jacket on the car’s back seat. Cefai appeared before Magistrate Leonard Caruana charged with possession of cocaine found in circumstances denoting it was not for personal use as well as with trying to flee from the scene, resisting the police and disobeying their orders. He was further charged with relapsing and with breaching the conditions of a previous release since he was out on bail over other crimes. He was accused of breaching the bail conditions imposed in April 2022, in a case in which he stands charged with his involvement in an alleged hold-up in Naxxar with two accomplices. Defence lawyers asked Magistrate Caruana to release their client on bail, arguing that the alleged incident was caught on the police bodycams so the evidence was preserved. However, police inspector Mark Cremona countered that there were civilian witnesses who still had to testify in the case. The court turned down the request since Cefai did not offer the guarantees that he would respect bail conditions is released. He was remanded in custody.  Lawyers Charles Mercieca, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel. Cefai is synonymous with various crimes in Gozo, and was once described by a judge as a person who “terrorised Gozo” with his constant aggressive attitude. In 2012, he stabbed a man inside a courtroom and was given a seven-year jail sentence. He was back in court in August last year, after he seriously injured a man who tried to rob him. In that case, the court heard how a robber entered the residence of the notorious Gozitan criminal but ended up leaving empty-handed and with serious facial injuries when the two got into a fight. Correction January 27, 2024: A previous version stated that Cefai was charged in Gozo. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Reform to shorten criminal court cases to begin ‘in months' - Justice Ministry,Claudia Calleja,"The legislative process to shorten lengthy court proceedings will be kickstarted “in the coming months”, a Justice Ministry spokesperson has said after the family of a murder victim said the slow court system was adding to their pain. In an interview with Times of Malta, Daria Dembska said her family “cannot start mourning” until the man accused of murdering her sister Paulina in January 2022 is judged. Last year, a government White Paper proposed that the compilation of evidence stage should be concluded within one year from an arraignment. It also sought to eliminate the process called ‘referral’ (rinviju) that often lengthens the compilation as court documents bounce between the court and the attorney general’s office. This is no longer needed as it is now mandatory for AG representatives to be present in court. A Justice Ministry spokesperson said the consultation stage for the reform, which has been discussed for years, has been concluded. “We received numerous suggestions and proposals, which resulted in a very valid and informative consultation. There have been proposals that built on the consultation document, as well as broadened the scope of the reform. Thus, we had to amend and strengthen the draft bill, as well as consult with key stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the reform,” the spokesperson said. “It is our intention that in the coming months we kickstart the legislative process in parliament,” she added. Malta had emulated the British legal system in 1814 by laying down the need for a compilation of evidence to take place before a criminal trial. Britain has since removed this requirement to speed up the legal process, but Malta retains it. It means that before a trial can begin, the compilation of evidence process must take place.   Paulina Dembska, a 29-year-old Polish student was raped and strangled in the heart of Sliema on January 2, 2022. Abner Aquilina was arrested for the murder, charged, and the compilation of evidence process began. Two years later, it is still ongoing. A parallel has been drawn with the unprovoked murder of Ashling Murphy that happened in Ireland a few days after Dembska’s. When Roberta Metsola became European Parliament president that month, she paid tribute to both murdered women. But in the case of the 23-year-old Irish woman, the case has been concluded. Murphy, a 23-year-old teacher and musician, was murdered as she jogged along a canal near Tullamore, County Offaly, on January 12. Jozef Puska, 33, was charged with murder later that month. The trial began in October 2023, and three weeks later, he was jailed for life. Unlike the Irish justice system, a person charged in a Maltese court first has to go through the compilation of evidence in front of the Magistrates’ Court before the trial by jury can start in the presence of a panel of jurors and a judge. During the compilation, the police bring forward their witnesses as do the defence before the magistrate decides if there is a case against that person to go to trial. Franco Debono, a lawyer who specialises in criminal law, said that he agreed with reforming the compilation of evidence, noting that he had suggested doing that in a 2011 holistic justice reform private members bill when he was a Nationalist MP. However, he disagreed with removing it completely in any court case. He explained that the compilation of evidence served, among others, as a discovery stage – to build the picture of events, which is not always clear-cut and draw up the bill of indictment. Removing it entirely could mean that the full picture of events could not emerge, possibly leading to miscarriages of justice, Debono argued.  “Just because another country removed it, it does not mean they have a better system. I have always believed that a lazy justice system is not good, but one that is too hasty is even worse,” he said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Today's front pages – January 26, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Friday. Times of Malta leads with a call by the Gozo Tourism Association to extend the ban on demolition and excavation in summer to the entire island, insisting that the whole of Gozo is considered to be a tourist zone. The newspaper reports prominently on Thursday’s compilation of evidence against a man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend in Sliema that has been delayed after the defence challenged Malta's new femicide law. Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada denies the aggravated crime of femicide, which was introduced in the Criminal Code in 2022, and makes him liable to a harsher punishment. The Malta Independent and L-orizzont also report on the murder court case that was due to begin on Thursday but was deferred until next month. In-Nazzjon and The Malta Independent also report how patients at Mater Dei Hospital were being forced into “undignified” situations as they waited for beds to free up. Adrian Delia, the shadow minister for health, spoke on Thursday about persistent issues with long waiting lists at the country’s main hospital and warned that a staff shortage and staff burnout were close to leading Malta’s healthcare into a “critical emergency”. In-Nazzjon separately reports how certain factions within the Labour Party were pushing the idea for former leader Joseph Muscat to return to politics. L-orizzont meanwhile leads with comments by Foreign Minister Ian Borg that the “illegal” war of Russia in Ukraine topped Malta’s agenda as chair of the OSCE. The newspaper also reports on a case of a man who was a victim of domestic violence at home. He claims his wife threatened him with a gun.

"Man stopped by police over brake lights, charged with drug possession",Edwina Brincat,"A driver, flagged down by community police over malfunctioning brake lights, ended up in greater trouble when officers sensed a ""strong smell of cannabis"" coming from the vehicle.  Omar Alhamdoalgorsh, a 26-year-old Syrian gypsum worker from Buġibba, was escorted to court on Thursday after being arrested two days ago.  Court was told that on Tuesday, community police patrolling the St Paul's Bay area spotted a vehicle with malfunctioning rear brake lights. They flagged down the driver and when they approached the vehicle they smelt ""a strong scent of cannabis"", prosecuting inspector Francesco Mizzi told court on Thursday.  A search of the vehicle yielded two sachets of cannabis on the dashboard. The officers found another bag of cannabis and a sachet containing eight ecstasy pills.  The driver was escorted to the Qawra police station, given his legal rights and told the reason for the arrest.  Asked by defence lawyer Noel Bianco, the prosecutor said that the accused had cooperated all along.  The man's family lived in Malta and he had a stable job, argued the lawyer when pushing for bail.  Moreover, he had cooperated fully, telling police how he acquired the drug.  As for the amounts, the accused had bought the drugs to share with a friend who was on holiday in Malta and staying at a hotel, pointed out the prosecutor, objecting to the request for bail.  The defence countered that the accused had admitted to police that he needed help to quit drugs and even cried under interrogation.  After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, upheld the request under various conditions, including a treatment order.  The accused would be monitored by a probation officer who was to report to court every two months.  ""One negative report will spell repercussions,"" warned the magistrate.  The accused was to pay a deposit of €500, bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000, sign the bail book twice weekly and be home between 10pm and 6am. Inspector Francesco Mizzi prosecuted.

Life sentences should be removed from Malta's laws - Chamber of Advocates,Times of Malta,"The Chamber of Advocates said on Wednesday that it agreed in principle with a reform of the drug laws proposed by the government in a white paper. It said, however, that it is of the view that the concept of a life sentence for those convicted of trafficking illegal substances should no longer have a place in the laws. ""The time has come for the parties represented in parliament to acknowledge that this punishment is draconian, it no longer exists in democratic countries and it should be removed from the criminal code in Malta,"" the chamber said. It said it agreed with the proposal that people accused of trafficking could choose between being tried by jury or by judges. But it felt that illicit substances should be divided into two categories according to their nature.  RELATED STORIES  As for the amount of drugs that would qualify an accused person to be arraigned before the Rehabilitation Board, the Chamber said that there should be a benchmark but not a fixed amount so as to avoid injustices owing to the rigidity of the numbers proposed.

Man cleared of conspiring to burn car of ex’s new boyfriend,Edwina Brincat,"A man accused of conspiring to burn a BMW vehicle driven by his ex-partner’s new boyfriend has been cleared based on lack of sufficient evidence.  Luke Vella, a 28-year-old Żabbar resident, was charged with conspiracy to commit arson, causing third parties to fear violence as well as breaching three previous sets of bail conditions.  Criminal investigations date to 2020 when Vella’s suspected accomplice headed to the Żabbar police station to spill the beans on the accused who had allegedly been trying to rope him into his plan to set fire to a particular vehicle. Gordon Albani, the alleged accomplice, detailed the alleged plot.  Vella was to call for him, drive him to his house to collect certain items, and then drop him off at the spot where the arson was to be committed.  But although he heard Vella’s plans and went along with him, he never meant to carry out the task, Albani later told police.  Instead of committing the arson, he headed to the police station to file a report.  Vella was subsequently charged, pleading not guilty. The court heard that the accused had been in a relationship with a woman and the couple also had a young child.  After they broke up, the woman started a relationship with someone else.  Her new boyfriend drove a BMW model that was registered in his father’s name.  That was the vehicle allegedly targeted in the planned arson.  Vella’s ex testified in the proceedings that Albani used to turn up at her takeaway outlet at  Żabbar, asking for money and food.  The guy had also told her about how her ex, Vella, had allegedly spoken to him several times to burn down her new boyfriend’s car. Albani claimed that Vella had promised him €700 for the job which was allegedly planned for the night of October 12, 2020.  That information had prompted the woman and her boyfriend to file a police report.  Vella denied any such agreement with Albani.  The prosecution produced mobile localisation and call profile data to prove that Vella and Albani were well acquainted and communicated frequently. That data - covering the period between June and October - showed that Vella called Albani 20 times on eight different days.  Between October 6 and 13, they communicated 12 times. Calls were localised around Żabbar, Żejtun, Birżebbuġa and Vittoriosa.  Although the pattern and frequency of those calls appeared to coincide with the prosecution’s theory, the content of the calls was unknown.  The very first element of the crime of conspiracy is the existence of an agreement between two or more people.  In this case, evidence showed that even if Vella was trying to convince Albani to go along with his plan, Albani never accepted, not even momentarily, to commit the arson.  Failure to prove that first element meant that the prosecution failed to prove the charge of conspiracy, said presiding Magistrate Leonard Caruana.  When testifying, Vella’s ex as well as her new boyfriend and his father, never expressed any sign of fear.  After Albani spoke to her about Vella’s arson plan, the woman was not convinced that the crime would take place.  Albani had also told her about some court proceedings involving him and Vella and said that he wanted to take revenge against her ex after landing a conviction.  There was no evidence of any fire having been started.  When all was considered, the court concluded that those offences were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and consequently Vella could not be found guilty of breaching those three bail decrees. The court thus pronounced an acquittal.  Lawyer Roberto Montalto was defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Andrea Prudente libel case continues in court,Edwina Brincat,"US doctors told Andrea Prudente it was ""not an issue"" when she consulted them after experiencing some spotting for 15 days before she was due to travel from Seattle to Malta, a court heard on Monday.  Prudente’s case hit international headlines when she was denied an abortion in Malta after suffering a ruptured membrane while 16 weeks pregnant. Doctors told her they could only intervene if her life was at imminent risk. Her pregnancy was medically terminated in Spain. On Monday court heard that before travelling to Malta for her babymoon, Prudente had been told spotting was not an issue. That information was divulged in libel proceedings instituted by Prudente’s lawyer, Lara Dimitrijevic, on her behalf against former Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi over claims that the American tourist had conspired to introduce abortion in the country.  Another libel case was instituted against academic and blogger Simon Mercieca over a similar story he uploaded on his blog about the expectant mother who experienced symptoms of miscarriage during her trip to Malta in June 2022.  In a separate, constitutional case, Prudente is claiming that her fundamental rights were breached when doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy after her waters broke at 16 weeks. The suit against Azzopardi concerns a Facebook post in which the former MP claimed that Prudente came to Malta purposely to stir controversy over the termination of her pregnancy.  When the case resumed on Monday, Yves Muscat Baron, consultant head of the maternity and gynaecology department at Mater Dei Hospital, testified that he had never spoken to or examined Prudente but had checked her medical file after her gynaecologist consulted him about the case.  The woman was 16 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to Mater Dei Hospital after her waters ruptured.  Prudente later explained that she had been spotting for some 15 days before setting out on her trip to Malta with her partner, Jay Weeldreyer for their babymoon.  When testifying in separate breach of rights proceedings against the State, Prudente said that before travelling, she had consulted her health care providers who told her that such spotting was probably normal after intercourse, said Muscat Baron.  “But that [spotting] could also indicate detachment of the placenta… So we tell them [patients] to rest, not travel half across the world.”  Prudente travelled from Seattle to London and onto Malta, then crossed over to Gozo. She consulted doctors at Gozo General Hospital after experiencing more spotting but the foetal heartbeat and waters were all in place.   RELATED STORIES  The couple then visited a consultant at a private hospital who confirmed that there were blood clots behind the placenta.  Two days later, the patient’s waters ruptured and the consultant, Alberto Vella, referred her to Mater Dei Hospital where she was monitored for seven days.  During that period, Prudente had contacted gynecologist Isabelle Stabile who, in turn, called Vella saying, “you know what to do”.  That call was rather unusual and appeared to carry a “sort of threat”, prompting Vella to consult Muscat Baron who summoned a consultancy conference to discuss Prudente’s case with three other specialists.  Asked by Azzopardi’s lawyer, the witness said that Prudente was never in danger of dying.  That was the line of discussion among the consultants.  Asked by presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello whether the baby could survive at the point when Prudente went to Gozo, Muscat Baron replied, “yes”.  “Prudente herself was not at all in danger of dying,” went on the witness, when questioned by Prudente’s lawyer, Andrew Sciberras.  The patient was given intravenous antibiotics for a urinary tract infection she had at the time, reducing the risk of that infection being transmitted to the baby.  When waters rupture, there is a 1% risk of uterine infection too.  But when pressed further about the detached placenta, Muscat Baron explained that although there were blood clots behind the placenta, an unborn child can survive even when the surface area of the placenta is only 25% attached.  “It’s not a death sentence for the baby,"" he said. In Prudente’s case, the placenta was protruding, pointed out the lawyer.  But the consultant rebutted that if that were the case, the baby would not live. When Prudente was admitted to Mater Dei Hospital, an ultrasound showed that there was no liquid around the baby and there was prolapse of the umbilical cord. However after the mother rested in hospital, the cord moved back up.  “Had it remained outside [the mother’s body] it would have dried up and died.” “How did you conclude that Prudente did not rest,” asked Sciberras.  The expectant mother had travelled from Seattle to London and then to Malta and Gozo, Muscat Baron replied. “So are you saying that a pregnant woman cannot travel,” asked Sciberras. There was a difference when a pregnant mother was bleeding. “It’s only logical,” remarked Muscat Baron, drawing parallels with a “worse case” where a woman’s waters ruptured at 13 weeks.  In that case, he said, the baby had survived.  “Was it medically identical,” asked the lawyer.  “It was even worse at 13 weeks,"" Muscat Baron replied. The majority of those in the maternity department were of the view that it was not recommended for Prudente to travel, he added. “This is not my opinion. The majority of people within our department all say the same: It’s an accepted medical opinion”.  Asked whether he knew of any ulterior motive for Prudente to travel to Malta, the consultant replied, “she was on a babymoon”.  Prudente’s medical file was presented in evidence by a Mater Dei representative.  The case continues.  Lawyers Lara Dimitrijevic and Andrew Sciberras are representing Prudente.

Court delays hamper FIAU's fight against money laundering: report,Jacob Borg,"Efforts by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit to effectively police the banking sector are being “greatly undermined” by delays in court proceedings, according to a national money-laundering risk assessment report. The anti-money laundering unit has faced an avalanche of appeals against the penalties it issues for anti-money laundering breaches. Both the size of such penalties and the FIAU’s ability to even issue fines have been successfully challenged in court. The report – led by a committee that includes the police and FIAU – hits out at the fact that a number of appeals against the size of the fines have been pending for more than the six months set out by law. It also questions whether the members of the judiciary hearing these appeals have the necessary know-how to do so.  ""Appeals to sanctions imposed by the FIAU are heard by the court of appeal, and being a general court, the level of expertise necessary to confirm or otherwise the breaches determined by the FIAU and what factors to consider as to whether a sanction is proportionate, dissuasive and effective may be weak,” the report says. When fines are “substantially” reduced by the court, the reason behind this reduction is often “not explained”, nor is any explanation offered as to how this reduced fine could act as a proportionate, effective and dissuasive measure. “This happens even when the same court would have confirmed all, or the greater part of the breaches as identified by the FIAU, as well as their materiality and severity,” the report says. The report does however note that except for a few banks, sanctions imposed by the FIAU on credit institutions are not appealed, as an agreement is reached to implement the directives imposed to address any gaps in their anti-money laundering systems. It said the serious breaches by two credit institutions, a reference to the now defunct Pilatus Bank and Satabank, served as crucial lessons for Malta when it came to anti-money laundering laws. “Both cases have received a lot of public attention, both locally and internationally, and demonstrated the authorities’ commitment and strength in detecting and enforcing effective and proportionate measures for serious breaches of anti-money laundering obligations. “The MFSA has also taken effective measures for the risks identified in both credit institutions, leading to the European Central Bank withdrawing the banking licence of both institutions based on MFSA’s proposal,” the report says.

Man charged with trafficking drugs after dogs sniff cannabis in his car,Edwina Brincat,"A driver was on Sunday charged with drug trafficking after customs officials and a sniffer dog found cannabis grass in his car just as he got off the Sicily ferry. Nemanja Bozin, a 36-year-old Serbian national living at Wardija, had just got off the catamaran from Pozzallo on Friday when sniffer dogs first roused suspicion. A search of the vehicle yielded cannabis grass in the front part of the car and also in a container. The driver was arrested and was on Sunday charged with the alleged involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy, importation of cannabis grass as well as possessing the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not intended solely for personal use.  The accused - a maintenance worker on board vessels - pleaded not guilty.  His defence lawyer did not request bail at the arraignment stage and the court, presided over by magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia remanded the accused in custody.

"Today's front pages - January 21, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Sunday. The Sunday Times of Malta leads with findings of a national assessment of Malta’s financial crime risks which show that the volume of money laundering taking place through the property market could be “significant”. The newspaper separately reports that according to a Times of Malta exercise, several food items earmarked for price reductions through a government scheme are unlikely to see big cuts at the supermarket till, if anything at all. The Malta Independent on Sunday leads its front page with news that plans for a new Paceville junction are set to be filed with the Planning Authority next month.

Keep saying no,Anna Marie Galea,"An investigation carried out by UN Women UK a few years back found that 97% of women in the UK aged 18 to 24 have been sexually harassed. And 96% of those women did not report the incident because they felt it would not change anything. The research also showed that women who were groped, followed and pressured into sexual activity did not think that their experiences were “serious enough” to be reported. What this means is that this type of behaviour has become so normalised and played down that women have just come to accept it as being par for the course of being a woman. To be female is to be a target. I’ve also found that a lady’s “no” doesn’t always seem to carry the weight it should. In my teenage years, several people seemed to mistake my “nos” for “maybes”, putting me in sometimes very uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations. It was only when I got older and angrier that it got better. Telling a woman in her 30s to smile doesn’t seem to have the same effect it does as when you say it to a vulnerable 15-year-old who’s just realising that not everything is sunshine and roses. Just this week, a Maltese woman claimed that she was filmed without her consent at a local gym. The woman in question was approached at the gym by a small group of men and, after one of them started to work out next to her, he asked her to remove her headphones so that he could flirt with her. She quickly realised that one of the men who had approached her was a Tiktoker known on the platform for his videos of trying to pick up women and messaged to say that she didn’t want to be part of any video or on social media.   Apparently, her “no” wasn’t final enough for the group and one of them kept insisting that they post the video anyway with her face blurred out. She didn’t agree to this either. The footage still went live, though, but with her blurred out (her part has since been removed). It took her taking to social media and a lot of backlash for an apology video to be issued and this was only after she was told that she was blowing things out of proportion. I honestly can’t think of anything more tiring than being a woman. Whether you’re at the gym, on the bus or at the supermarket wearing headphones, why do men feel it’s okay to invade your personal space? Women don’t care how hot you think you are and how sparkling you believe your conversation to be; most of them want to be left alone. We shouldn’t have to say we have boyfriends or husbands at home to justify our “nos” either. How unbelievably sad it is to think that the mere outline of a man that may or may not exist carries more weight than a female’s agency to choose who to talk to and how to spend her time. In a world where your time and body are constantly treated like commodities and the expectation is to give in because you either won’t be taken seriously or made to feel silly, it takes courage to say no.

‘Significant’ money laundering through property market,Jacob Borg,"The volume of money laundering taking place through the property market could be “significant”, according to a national assessment of Malta’s financial crime risks. The 200-page national risk assessment seeks to identify the country’s money laundering threats and vulnerabilities. This assessment, led by a committee that includes the police and FIAU, says the full scale of money laundering through the property sector is unknown. However, the share of real estate assets frozen in Malta in 2021 was estimated at €44.6 million, thereby indicating that money laundering through the real estate sector is “significant”, the report says. Assets are frozen by the authorities during criminal proceedings involving financial crimes. The assessment pinpoints property as an attractive method for criminals to hide their illicit proceeds, as it allows them to launder large amounts of money in a single transaction. Criminals may also invest in property to rebuild and sell at a higher price, to justify their income, the report continues. In 2021, the government introduced a €10,000 cap on cash transactions for the sale of property and other valuable items. The report highlighted how these rules do not extend to the use of cash for construction, renovation or finishings, thus raising the risk that cash from criminal activities is laundered through property. Similarly, concerns were raised about the rental market, as the rent can give criminals a legitimate income. The report details how buyers and sellers may attempt to reduce their tax dues on property sales by deliberately undervaluing the properties. According to data by the tax authorities, 32 per cent of all property deals in 2021 were identified as being potentially undervalued. The Malta Tax and Customs Administration appoints an independent architect to value the property in cases where undervaluation is identified, according to the report. Buyers would then be obliged to pay tax on the new valuations. An analysis of suspicious transaction reports by the FIAU involving property deals found that the majority of reports had at least one Maltese resident involved, and were mainly about tax crimes.  During a three-year period ending in December 2021, property purchases by foreigners did not register an increase, and Maltese nationals accounted for 98 per cent of the property deeds, the report says. The report also delves into the licensing of estate agents. It says that to date, there has been no enforcement against those operating without a licence. Furthermore, “vulnerabilities” exist in the licensing law, as people continue only acting as intermediaries during property sales “on an occasional basis”.

Alec Baldwin charged with manslaughter over Rust film death,AFP,"Actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with manslaughter over the deadly 2021 shooting on the set of his film Rust, according to a court document filed Friday. Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, was holding a Colt .45 during rehearsals for the low-budget Western in New Mexico when it discharged a live round, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the October 2021 shooting and said that he did not pull the trigger on the gun, which in any case should have been loaded with a dummy. Friday's development marks the latest attempt to hold someone to account for the deadly episode, which sent shockwaves through Hollywood and led to calls for tightening rules around firearms on movie sets. Initial manslaughter charges against Baldwin were dropped in April last year, due to what prosecutors called ""new facts"" which demanded ""further investigation and forensic analysis."" In October, prosecutors said they were convening a grand jury - a group of citizens who assess evidence and decide whether there is a case to answer. ""We look forward to our day in court,"" Baldwin's attorneys Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro said in a statement sent to AFP on Friday. Baldwin reportedly faces up to 18 months in jail if convicted of the new charge. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer - the person responsible for supplying and maintaining weapons - is set to go on trial next month on charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. Prosecutors say that as the person who loaded the gun, she is culpable. She denies the charges. There has been no explanation as to how live rounds ended up on the movie set. Dave Halls, the film's safety coordinator and assistant director who handed Baldwin the loaded gun, agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to six months probation. Filming of Rust resumed last year, and has now been completed, Variety reported, using new locations in the US state of Montana. The cinematographer's widower, Matthew Hutchins, served as an executive producer. He has already settled a wrongful death suit with Rust producers and has said he has ""no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame,"" calling his wife's death ""a terrible accident."" Director Souza also returned, saying at the time that completing the movie would be ""bittersweet"" but that the cast and crew ""are committed to completing what Halyna and I started.""

Man admits snatching café tip jar was 'stupid mistake',Edwina Brincat,"A man who admitted his “stupid mistake” after helping himself to the tips box at a cafeteria, was remanded in custody after admitting to simple theft on Friday afternoon.  Manpreet Singh, a 27-year-old Indian national with a Maltese residence permit, landed in hot water after helping himself to the coins meant as tips for staff at a St Paul’s Bay cafeteria on Triq Censu Tanti.  The theft took place early on Thursday morning and was reported at the Qawra police station at 11 am. Security footage from the shop was also turned in that clearly showed the suspect. Footage showed a man wearing a black hoodie and carrying a red backpack, with the police using stills from the video to send out wanted posters for him. Later on Thursday, police officers patrolling the streets of Marsa spotted a man who appeared to match the description of that wanted person, with his hoodie and backpack also matching the images.  The suspect was approached and informed that he was being placed under arrest and was escorted to the Ħamrun police station where he was given his legal rights. The suspect admitted that he had committed “a stupid mistake.” His backpack yielded some coins which the man admitted had been taken from the tips box at the St Paul’s Bay café. Upon arraignment, Singh pleaded guilty to simple theft of cash amounting to some €150 as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.  Prosecuting Inspector Francesco Mizzi said that the accused had social, economic as well as drug problems which he needed to address and to rehabilitate.  For that reason, an effective term of imprisonment would enable him to rehabilitate himself. The man had previously faced homelessness but had now found somewhere to live and also managed to get a job countered his legal aid lawyer.  The accused was still young and if given a suspended sentence and a treatment order, that would allow him “another chance,” in life, argued the defence.  After hearing submissions on punishment the court presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, deferred the case to next week for delivery of judgment. The accused was meanwhile remanded in custody.

Suspected trafficker nabbed after accepting drug parcel from undercover police,Edwina Brincat,"A man, who signed a parcel delivered by a police officer dressed as a postman, was remanded in custody after facing charges allegedly linking him to a drug-trafficking conspiracy.

That parcel was flagged to police by customs officers way back on December 27. The controlled delivery was carried out on Wednesday by lead investigator Jonathan Pace who, dressed as a postal worker, went to a Xemxija address indicated on the parcel.  As soon as he reached the street where the address was located, two men approached his van, asking whether he had a parcel addressed to a third party.  Replying in the affirmative, the undercover officer approached the entrance to a garage where Bjelica signed for the delivery, just as police colleagues moved in to arrest the suspect.  Later, police also searched the Mellieħa residence where the youth lived with his father.  Fourteen cannabis plants were found in that residence, together with some fertilizer, masks, laptops and other electronic devices.  During the suspect’s arraignment on Friday, Pace explained that back in November and December other similar packages had been addressed to Bjelica. The suspect pleaded not guilty to importing cannabis grass, complicity in a drug importation and trafficking conspiracy, possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not solely for personal use as well as unlawful cultivation of the plant.  During his interrogation, the suspect had opted not to answer most of the questions as he had a right to and had even started crying, pointed out the prosecutor.  A request for bail was objected to at this early stage, not only because of the amount of drug involved but also because other witnesses, besides police officers and experts, were still to testify.  Those included the accused’s father and owner of the Mellieha residence as well as owners of other residences to which previous parcels had been addressed.  Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca countered that not only was the accused not disposed to approach witnesses but those witnesses were expected to testify about “objectively proven” facts, such as ownership of the properties involved or the accused’s job history.  Bjelica had a fixed job and lived with his father.  Denying him bail would risk his job and would make him unable to contribute to utility payments.  It would have a “snowball effect,” argued the lawyer, highlighting the fact that the accused had complied with police authorities and would likewise obey court orders.  However, after hearing submissions, the court presided over by magistrate Gabriella Vella turned down the request after being told that investigations were still ongoing and civilian witnesses were still to testify.  The court, however, solicited the prosecution to wrap up investigations as soon as practically possible.  Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.  Lawyer Charles Mercieca was defence counsel.

'This is what 500 ecstasy pills look like': ex-addict's viral video on drug laws,Times of Malta,"Updated January 20 with second video A recovering drug addict fears changes to local drug laws will encourage users to become traffickers - and has made that known in a video featuring inaccurate claims that's gone viral.  Clint Camilleri used smarties, salt and cocoa powder to show what 500 ecstasy pills, 200g of cocaine and 200g of heroin look like. His video, posted to Facebook page Strada Rjali, amassed 66,000 views in less than 20 hours.    Camilleri's video is a reaction to a reform proposed by the government that will revise the maximum amount of drugs a person can be caught with and still be tried before a drug court.  Introduced in 2015, drug courts focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment and can send a convicted person to time in rehab rather than jail.  They only come into play when a court rules that drugs involved in the crime were not for personal use.  In such cases, magistrates can choose to assign defendants to a drug court if they are caught with up to 300 grams of cannabis, 300 ecstasy pills or 100 grams of cocaine or heroin. The government wants to increase those limits to 500 grams for cannabis, 500 ecstasy pills or 200 grams of cocaine or heroin, and give magistrates the option of appointing a drug court if they believe the accused person was committing drug-related crime due addiction issues.  The proposal is currently open to public consultation. Proponents of the government's idea say this will give magistrates more leeway when handling criminal suspects they believe are struggling with addiction issues. They argue that many people have ended up kicking their drug habit and getting their life back on track, only to face the prospect of a long criminal sentence years after their drug crimes.  But the plan to revise laws has been slammed by the Opposition, which says it will lead to drug traffickers being treated as victims. The result will be having more drug traffickers within rehabilitation programmes, making it even harder for real victims to kick their habits.  ""The Nationalist Party does not want drug traffickers to be let off lightly, as the government wants, and it is objecting strongly to having the real victims of drugs and the traffickers being considered in the same way by the law,"" the PN said earlier this week. In his viral video, Camilleri says the new amounts proposed are ""scary"" and incorrectly conflates them with the maximum amount of drugs allowed for personal use. In reality, the proposed amendments have nothing to do with personal use limits. Instead, they concern crimes that will be heard by a drug court, which do not deal with cases related to personal use of drugs.  Currently, anyone caught with seven grams of cannabis, two grams of cocaine or heroin or two pills of ecstasy is let off with an administrative fine. Anyone caught with larger amounts can also be let off - but only if a magistrate concludes the drugs were for personal use.  In the video, Camilleri says that at the height of his drug use, he would take five ecstasy pills in a night. The maximum amount of pills he would take in one night would be five. ""With five I would be out of order: when I woke up I would not remember anything that happened the previous night. There were times I'd wake up in someone's kitchen, wondering where I was.  ""If I take five pills on Saturday and another five on Sunday, a stock of 500 pills would last me a year. How is a year's worth of pills considered personal use,"" he asks in the video.  Camilleri makes a similar argument about cocaine and heroin, again incorrectly claiming that the amendments will increase personal use limits.  A 200-gram stock of cocaine would last him 40 days if he took five grams a day, he says.  ""As an addict, my mind would start calculating: I'll keep five for myself and sell part of it. It feels like an invitation to sell some of it to turn a profit and buy even more,"" he says in the video. Camilleri explains that an addict could mix 200g of pure cocaine with other substances and turn it into a kilo of drugs that can be spread over three months while still turning a profit.  ""There is so much pain out there that no one is aware of. I want to cry when I see this, remembering what I went through and where I am at the moment. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through."" In a second video posted by the Facebook page, Camilleri met with Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, who sought to better explain the government's plan and dispel fears that the changes are related to personal use of drugs.   In reply to questions sent by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Justice Ministry reiterated that the amendments have nothing to do with laws governing personal use of drugs.  It also noted that the ultimate decision will rest with the magistrate presiding over each case.  The court must be “morally convinced of the accused’s prospects at rehabilitation,"" the spokesperson noted.  “Whenever the court is faced with a drug trafficker, it will continue to regard him as a drug trafficker, thus enforce harsh and appropriate punishments,” the spokesperson said.  “Furthermore, whoever is caught with any amount of drugs, even if it is less than the amounts in the schedule, and the Court thinks that the individual is not a person who was addicted to drugs, the person will be tried and penalised according to the law, based on the penalties that are already in place and which same penalties will not be amended.” The spokesperson said the amendments are being proposed following a review of case law related to drug offences and following internal consultation with the Sentencing Policy Advisory Board.  Furthermore, the new revised maximums will not allow quantities of illegal drugs below these numbers to be interpreted as being for personal use, the spokesperson said.  “Possession with intent to supply can still be inferred, given the appropriate circumstantial evidence. It is most likely to be inferred from possession of amounts included in the guidelines in question but which are high enough to trigger such an inference,” she said. “The law is not changing in this respect and the punishments applicable to possession with intent and to drug trafficking will still apply. The proposed changes would make no change to the elements of any drug offence.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Three reports in two days: man denied bail after stalking and harassing his ex,Edwina Brincat,"A man, who harassed and stalked his ex insisting on seeing the couple’s 18-month-old child, was denied bail after the court heard how the woman had filed three reports in two days. The alleged victim turned up at the domestic violence unit on Thursday at around 1 am after a fresh clash with her former partner, 30-year-old and self-employed Justin Chetcuti from Mosta.  The woman told police that the father of her young child kept bombarding her with messages that were also insulting and threatening in nature.  He persistently followed her around, insisting that he wanted to see his son.  Just a day before that latest report, Inspector Omar Zammit from the domestic violence unit had called Chetcuti and asked him to go over to his office. But the man said that he could not make it, blaming his inability to do so on “his painful back”. He promised the inspector that he would go the following morning but instead kept up with his harassment, trying to track down his ex and telling her that he wanted to see his son.  The man was arrested and escorted to court on Friday, pleading not guilty to stalking and harassment, insulting and threatening the alleged victim, causing her slight injuries as well as wilfully damaging her mobile.  He was also charged with relapsing.  Asked by defence lawyer Edmond Cuschieri whether the issue of access to the minor was the “apple of discord” between the estranged couple, the prosecutor confirmed. The lawyer pointed out that the accused had not been allowed to see his son for quite some time.  “Does that justify the threats?” remarked presiding Magistrate Gabriella Vella.  The court turned down a request for a ban on the accused’s name after the prosecution objected, pointing out that proceedings were public.  A ban was issued only on the name of the alleged victim.  A request for bail was also objected to because proceedings were still at a premature stage, with the woman still to testify and the parties living close to each other.  Moreover, the alleged offences were frequently repeated.  The victim had filed four reports in two weeks, three of them over two days.  Every time police spoke to the accused, he always came up with some excuse not to go to the police office, said Zammit, adding that the man was untrustworthy.  The accused’s lawyer countered that it all started because the father was not allowed to see his son. He now understood what this could lead to and would not keep up with his behaviour. “But God forbid if every person denied access to his child ends up in jail,” Cuschieri said.  However, the court turned down the request deeming that bail was premature at this stage, even because the victim was still to testify.

Italian court rules Fascist salute is a crime... sometimes,AFP,"The Fascist salute is a crime - but only in certain circumstances - Italy's top court has ruled, with experts warning convictions are unlikely just days after a video of a mass salute caused outrage. The Supreme Court made its decision Thursday in a separate case of eight people convicted for raising their right arms in what is also known as the Roman salute during a ceremony in Milan in 2016. It came just days after around 1,000 people were filmed saluting at the former Rome headquarters of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a party formed by supporters of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini after World War II.   The images went viral, sparking calls for prosecutions from opposition politicians - but also revealed confusion over whether the salute was illegal. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been criticised for refusing to condemn the event. Her far-right Brothers of Italy party has its roots in the MSI - and she joined its youth wing at 15. The Supreme Court judges concluded that the Fascist salute and the roll call ceremony - whereby participants at a demonstration reply ""Present"" while raising their arms, as they did in Rome on January 7 - are offences. The judges said the rituals were ""evocative of the gestures typical of the dissolved Fascist party"" of Mussolini, who ruled Italy with an iron fist between 1922 and 1943. But they added that a crime is not committed under the anti-Fascist Scelba law of 1952 if the gestures are carried out during a commemoration, and if it cannot be proven that those involved have the intentions of reviving the Fascist party. The judges also said another law, the 1993 Mancino law, which sanctions acts of discrimination or violence of a racial character, could be used. But the courts must decide. In the Milan case, the Supreme Court granted the defendants the right to appeal their convictions, saying the courts must decide whether there was a ""concrete danger of reorganisation of the dissolved Fascist party"". A defence lawyer in the case, Domenico Di Tullio, welcomed the ruling, saying it proved that the Fascist salute was ""not a crime"" unless there was a real danger of reviving the Fascist party, or racial discrimination or violence. ""In Italy, opinions are not punished,"" he said. Neo-fascist group CasaPound -- whose members are under investigation for the January 7 salutes -- also hailed it as a ""historic victory"". But Emilio Ricci of the anti-fascist National Association of Italian Partisans (ANPI) said rather than being ambiguous, the ruling clarifies how neo-fascists can be prosecuted. He called on authorities to charge the participants of the January 7 event, held in memory of the 1978 murders of two teenage activists of the MSI youth wing. Their killings were blamed on left-wing militants but nobody was ever convicted of the crimes, which came during a period of political violence in Italy known as the ""Years of Lead"". ""I hope the prosecutors will indict them for violation of the Scelba and Mancino laws,"" Ricci said. Constitutional expert Gaetano Azzariti told AFP the Supreme Court ""confirmed the anti-fascist values"" of the post-war Italian republic. With Thursday's ruling, it upholds the crime of apology for fascism, while leaving the application to the courts -- a balanced approach, in his view. But Giulio Vigevani, a professor of constitutional law, said it would still be complicated to prosecute the Fascist salute. ""The salute in itself is not a crime, it only becomes a crime if the rite qualifies as a danger of reorganisation of the Fascist party,"" he told AFP. ""In 99 per cent of cases, it will be no"" to prosecution, he said. ""The constitution says that Italian democracy is open, it is not afraid of its enemies.""

No racism when victim denied entry in club: police testifies in Paceville case,Edwina Brincat,"A police inspector testifying in the case of a man who was savagely beaten up in Paceville on New Year's Eve is claiming there was no racism involved when the alleged victim was denied entry into a club. Details of the incident emerged at the first hearing of the compilation of evidence against Ryan Zammit, a 26-year-old Gżira resident who was charged as one of five bouncers allegedly involved in the violent episode. Footage of the brutal attack, first published by Lovin Malta, showed around five bouncers kicking and hitting a man lying motionless on the floor as horrified onlookers watched. The victim also published a video showing that he had tried to get the police to intervene with an issue he was having with the club bouncers before the beating.  Before that video made it to social media, one of the alleged aggressors had already filed an official report to the police, claiming that he had been attacked with a broken bottle at around midnight.  That man, later identified as 21-year-old Albanian national Riald Gragjevi, was taken to hospital for treatment but had been discharged by the time police investigations into the incident kicked off.  Working on that social media footage, filmed by third parties who were still to be identified, the police set about gathering CCTV footage from various establishments located in the area where events leading up to the beating took place.  Piecing together the evidence was no easy task, even because hardly any of the final aggression was captured on video, mainly because surveillance cameras were obstructed by the festive decorations on the streets.  With “balloons and banners” in the way, footage only showed snippets of the chase leading up to the beating, explained prosecuting Inspector Brian Xuereb who testified at length in Zammit’s case.  “But people beating [the victim] cannot be seen. Or very little of it, through the [street] ornaments.” A surge of clubbers turned up at Havana before the stroke of midnight, each showing their Maltese identity card at the door to make it past security.  “All showing a valid ID card were allowed in, all race and colour… There were no racism issues whatsoever,” said the inspector, who had examined footage subsequently gathered from the site where the chain of events first started.  Then Sudanese national Ahmed Adem Idriss Albarjo, came up to the bouncers at the door, showed them a document but was turned away.  “They told him it (the document) wasn’t good,” said Xuereb. But the man insisted, refusing to leave until two bouncers led him down the stairs to the street, clearing the entrance so that other people could go in.  Idriss would not budge and that was when one of the bouncers punched him on the chin and forcibly led him away.  At that point, the rejected clubber went to some police officers patrolling the streets of Paceville, complaining and trying to get them to intervene in his issue with the bouncers.  He was told to go and file a police report.  Instead, the man headed back to the club, looking out for his ‘target’ to throw what appeared to be a sizeable Vodka bottle. Riald sensed the man’s intention and grabbed him by the arms. That was when Idriss fell to the ground, glass bottle in hand.  A scuffle broke out between the bouncer and Idriss who then grabbed the broken bottle and flung it straight at Riald, striking him on the upper back. After throwing the bottle, Idriss took to his heels. Several security guards reacted and gave chase, running after the man who headed in the direction of the Burger King outlet.  That was where the bouncers caught up with him, raining blows and punches. Riald was armed with a metallic telescopic baton, easily visible in the footage.  A large bouncer intervened and floored Idriss. The other bouncers stepped away but two of them, namely Riald and Zammit, continued, explained the prosecutor. Those two continued to hit and kick the man who lay motionless on the ground. Asked by Zammit’s lawyer, Herman Mula, whether the alleged victim had received a beating before Zammit stepped in, the inspector explained that before Zammit joined the aggression, the victim was still on his feet. Once the victim was floored by the large bouncer, Riald continued to hit Idriss with the baton on his head and legs. Both Riald and Zammit also kicked the man on the head.  Xuereb said that he could easily identify Zammit on that footage since he knew him by sight, having seen him on various previous occasions working at Paceville commercial establishments. That evening Zammit was not working at Havana and had joined the brawl further away when bouncers from that club caught up with the victim after the chase.  The court, presided over by magistrate Nadine Sant Lia, directed the inspector to indicate the various sources from which police had obtained the different footage documenting the whole incident.  Zammit was granted bail against a deposit of €1,000, a personal guarantee of €3,000, signing the bail book twice weekly and under a curfew between 10pm and 8am.  Idriss was meanwhile also granted bail in separate proceedings where he stands charged with slightly injuring the bouncer who suffered a tear on the chest and a cut on the head in the broken bottle episode.  AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Giuliana Magro Conti are prosecuting together with Inspector Brian Xuereb. Lawyer Herman Mula is counsel to Zammit. Lawyer Roberta Bonello is counsel to Idriss.  Lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi and Jessica Formosa are counsel to Gragjevi.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

'We remember Paulina': bench in Sliema commemorates femicide victims,Giulia Magri,"People paying tribute to murder victim Paulina Dembska can now gather their thoughts while seated at a bench dedicated to all Malta’s femicide victims. The Sliema promenade bench has been painted red and bears a plaque reading ""We remember Paulina. No horror could extinguish her light. No more excuses. Protect women."" The quote is from a speech given by European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who inaugurated the bench on Friday morning. Paulina's sister, Daria Dembska, was present at the inauguration as was Sliema mayor John Pillow.   Dembska, a Polish student, was 29 when she was killed in Independence Gardens on January 2, 2022. Abner Aquilina has been charged with her murder and is pleading not guilty.  The violent and random killing horrified the country and led to legislators making changes to the criminal code to punish killers more harshly when the crime is deemed a femicide. Two years after her murder, the case against Aquilina is nowhere near its end and Dembska’s family have lashed out at delays and said the accused appears to be receiving more psychological help than his victim’s family. The idea for the bench came after seeing a similar installation in Italy as part of that country’s ‘Posto Occupato’ (Seat Taken) campaign to stop violence against women. Speaking to Times of Malta on Friday, Daria explained that she and her sister had seen the bench inside a church in Trento, Italy during Christmas, just weeks before the murder. ""Paulina asked me what it meant,"" Daria recalled, saying she explained the concept to her sister, who said it would be a good idea to have similar installations in Malta and Poland. ""The point of this bench is to not only be a memorial for those we lost, but also to bring awareness about violence against women in our society. I don't want another family or woman to suffer and experience the pain we are going through,” Daria Dembska said.   The inauguration of the bench comes a day after the one-year anniversary of the murder of Pelin Kaya, a Turkish interior designer killed hours into her 30th birthday. During Friday’s event, Daria also presented a drawing by her young daughter to Metsola. The European Parliament is also understood to be looking into options to replace a memorial poster featuring a photo of Dembska and poem that was vandalised last year.

'I wish it was me instead of Pelin': sister tells Gżira vigil year after murder,Giulia Magri,"Pelin Kaya's sister Derya on Thursday told a vigil at the Gżira site where she was brutally killed a year ago she wished she had been killed instead of her younger sibling.   The Turkish interior designer was walking on Msida Road on January 18 of last year, moments after turning 30, when a BMW ploughed into her. The car came to a stop after crashing into a petrol station and the glass window of a KFC restaurant. CCTV footage showed the driver - Jeremie Camilleri - walking away from the wreckage and incredulously hurling rocks at Pelin as she lay dying on the side of the road. Tasered by the police within minutes, Camilleri later said he wanted to be famous. He is pleading not guilty. One year after her murder, Pelin's family spoke to Times of Malta about the way their lives have been savagely uprooted. Derya, however, has said she has “absolute faith” in the Maltese justice system and that the accused will be punished in the “harshest” manner. On Thursday, a tearful Derya placed her sister's favourite flower - a red gerbera daisy - at the memorial site set up just outside the KFC outlet. The  Gżira outlet remained closed.  She was followed by members of the Turkish Embassy including Ambassador Erdeniz Şen, Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg, Sliema Mayor John Pillow, Gżira Mayor Conrad Borg Manche, a KFC representative, friends of Pelin and members of the Turkish community. European President Roberta Metsola was also present.   Addressing the crowd with the help of an interpreter, Derya said she wished she had died on that faithful day instead of her sister.  ""We are where Pelin took her last breath. I wish it was me instead: her death has scarred me,"" she told those present, thanking them for not leaving her alone during this difficult night. ""Our human brain cannot make sense of the tragedy that took place a year ago at this site... we just have to endure it as a family."" Derya said all that was left was for the justice system to take its course and serve justice for Pelin.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

'Desperate' couple tries fleeing Malta with toddler when denied asylum,Edwina Brincat,"A father “desperate” to better his family’s situation after their asylum process proved unsuccessful was on Thursday remanded in custody after facing charges for trying to leave Malta using forged documents.  His partner and mother of the couple’s three-year-old daughter was granted bail only to allow her to take care of the child, after the court was assured that the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers would house the mother and child until court proceedings were concluded.  Abuji John, 29, and Ajoke Shittu, 31, both Nigerian nationals living in Żabbar, were charged separately with document forgery, knowingly having in their possession and making use of forged documents as well as making a false declaration.  Both pleaded not guilty. When asked by presiding Magistrate Victor George Axiak whether he was guilty or not, Abuji replied, “No, because I have to fight for my family”.  RELATED STORIES  Prosecuting Inspector Lara Butters, who pressed charges separately against the parents on Thursday explained that the Nigerian couple and their child had been stopped by immigration police at Malta International Airport.  The couple and young child were on their way to catch a flight to Naples when their Italian passports and residence cards roused suspicion. The documents turned out to be counterfeits.  Later, during his statement to the police, the father said that he was “deeply desperate” because their asylum process had failed and their request for asylum was rejected. Faced with that decision, the man said that “he needed to do something for a better life for his family and daughter”, said the prosecutor.  His request for bail was objected to by the prosecution who highlighted the fact that the father had managed to obtain forged documents and tried to flee.  Chats on the accused’s phone appeared to indicate that a third party was involved but during his interrogation, Abuji did not cooperate. Moreover, he had admitted that he had no money and that was why he had tried to flee. Nor did he have a fixed address where to stay, added Butters.  “There is no reason to discriminate between mother and father,” countered defence lawyer Martin Farrugia, pointing out that both parents faced identical charges, but the mother had been granted bail. Her partner was an asylum seeker and also father to their three-year-old child.  So far, the prosecution had put forward allegations and many hypothetical statements, argued the lawyer. But there was no legal basis to deny the father bail. The court was requested “not to discriminate to make sure that the family would not be torn apart"". “This is no issue of discrimination”, hit back the prosecutor, pointing out that the mother was granted bail only because the child could not be “left alone” and no placement was possible.  “As a father, he has an equal right to be with his family… there is no reason to impose different conditions on the father. We’re not asking for any preferential treatment, but simply bail under the same conditions [as the mother],” argued the defence.  However, the court turned down the request because it lacked peace of mind that the man would be able to satisfy all bail conditions.   RELATED STORIES  The mother’s request for bail had also been objected to by the prosecution who argued that the family had run out of legal options once their asylum process had run its course.  Upon a direct question by the court, the prosecutor explained that the child was currently being cared for by Appoġġ and if bail were to be denied to the mother, the police would seek a care order for the child.  A representative of AWAS was then asked to explain whether the agency could cater for the mother’s situation.  “I can confirm that in her situation, with a young child, AWAS will accept her and house her until court proceedings are over,” said the representative.  “The agency always strives to keep family units together.”  In light of that information the prosecutor did not raise further objections to bail and the court upheld the mother’s request against a personal guarantee of €20,000, an order to sign the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am.  Mother and child were to reside at the Marsa Initial Reception Centre. The court explained those conditions to the mother making it clear that she was being granted bail only to be able to care for her young daughter and warned her of the consequences if she were to breach any of the court’s conditions.

Man who injured mother during brawl at home remanded in custody,Edwina Brincat,"A 24-year-old who pleaded guilty to injuring his mother during a brawl at home and relapsing was on Thursday remanded in custody.  The man was escorted to court under the watchful gaze of his father to face charges over the violent episode which had resulted in slight injuries to the mother.  Defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi told court the violence was ""triggered"" by the accused’s mental condition. The youth was receiving psychiatric help and was on five different types of medication. Azzopardi claimed the accused did not realise what happened at the time but when questioned by a police inspector and shown photos of his mother's injuries he “broke down"". He said the man was remorseful and faced reality, knowing fully well that he was to shoulder the consequences.  Prosecuting Inspector Omar Zammit, from the Domestic Violence Unit said the accused had cooperated after the incident, acknowledged his mistake and said he was sorry.  “He needs help,” said the prosecutor, echoing a request by Azzopardi for the court to recommend the accused be detained at Mount Carmel’s Forensic Unit.  Azzopardi said there would be no request for bail, but the accused was pleading guilty and resigned to spending some days in custody until judgment was delivered.  A few days of deprivation of his liberty would help the youth come to terms with his situation, said the lawyer, while the accused’s father broke down in tears and walked out of the courtroom.  The defence and the prosecution suggested a term of probation as appropriate punishment. The accused pleaded guilty to causing his mother to fear violence, slightly injuring her as well as relapsing.  Upon that admission, the court, presided over by magistrate Victor George Axiak, remanded the accused in custody pending delivery of judgment next week.  The court also upheld a request for a ban on names to safeguard the identity of the victim and her family.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Government, Opposition agree to double pre-trial arrest period for serious crime",Times of Malta,"Both sides of the House have agreed to double the maximum period of pre-trial arrest for serious crimes. Police can currently hold a person under arrest for 48 hours before charging them with a crime. Over the past months, parliament debated extending that period for crimes that are subject to a jail sentence exceeding 12 years. The government initially suggested an additional 84 hours, subject to a magistrate’s approval. But PN MPs Carm Mifsud Bonnici and Mario de Marco had expressed concern at tripling the maximum period of pre-trial arrest. They had claimed hardened criminals and delinquents would not be affected by these changes and would just remain silent. The legislative amendment would impact innocent people who ended up arrested by the police, they had said. The proposed amendment stemmed from concerns among investigators that the existing 48-hour limit was insufficient when probing major crimes or criminal suspects. In such cases, interrogations or results of forensic tests can take longer than the maximum 48-hour period. On Wednesday, the Justice Ministry said in a statement that the proposal to extend the pre-trial arrest period by another 48 hours had made it through the committee stage. It is now set to go through the Third Reading. Minister Jonathan Attard reassured that the legislative amendment will not change the accused's rights. Attard welcomed news that the proposed changes had been approved by both sides of the House, as the bill will need two-thirds of MPs' votes to become law.

"Drug addict stole €14,000 in gold items over Christmas and holiday season",Edwina Brincat,"A drug addict, who allegedly stole some €14,000 in gold items during a string of robberies from private residences over Christmas and the New Year, was remanded in custody upon arraignment on Wednesday. Joseph Attard, a 48-year-old construction worker from Għaxaq, was tracked down as the prime suspect behind two thefts and another two failed attempts which took place between December 19 and January 7.  Prosecuting Inspector Joseph Mercieca said CCTV footage and other evidence led investigators to Attard’s arrest.  A Marsascala apartment was targeted first on December 19 afternoon but the plan failed. The following day, another attempted theft was reported at a Fgura property.  The third time around, the thief targeted a Marsascala apartment on New Year’s Day and made off with several valuables, mainly gold items.  The owner of the property later identified Attard as a worker who was carrying out work in an apartment within the same block.  The suspect’s phone localisation data subsequently placed Attard in that area around the time when the theft took place.  On January 7 more valuables were reported stolen from a private residence in Għaxaq.  The victim’s son spotted someone, later identified as Attard, walking away from the property. He later identified the suspect when shown photos by police.  The following day, when the son accompanied his father to the police station to report the theft, he spotted Attard who happened to turn up just then to sign the bail book.  On January 12 the police obtained an arrest warrant. However, when they arrested the suspect he was admitted to hospital and released on police bail.  On Wednesday the suspect reported back to the police who proceeded with his arraignment.  Attard pleaded not guilty to two aggravated thefts, two attempted thefts, wilful damage to third-party property, breaching bail and relapsing.  A request for bail was objected to not only because the victims were still to testify but also in light of the accused’s ""unruly character"" as evidenced by his criminal record that was “not voluminous but like a book, being some 35 pages long,” argued AG lawyer Andreas Vella. Besides, the accused had an acute drug problem and psychological issues, added Mercieca.  Attard’s legal aid lawyer, Adriano Spiteri, pointed out that the accused had a fixed address but acknowledged that his drug problem had never been properly treated.  The court, presided over by magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil, turned down the request and recommended that the prison director was to afford the accused all necessary medical assistance to address his problems.  Inspectors Antonello Magri and Doriette Cuschieri also prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Man denied bail after woman forgives nine years of abuse,Edwina Brincat,"A man who psychologically abused his wife for nine years was on Wednesday denied bail when a court decided to proceed with the case despite the victim wanting to drop the charges. The 45-year-old technical officer was arraigned after his wife filed a report at the police domestic violence unit, following years of alleged financial and psychological abuse.  Prosecuting Inspector Audrey Micallef said the woman recounted how the man controlled the purse strings, paid bills with her wage and left her at his mercy.  He constantly told her she “was good for nothing,” and “not presentable in public”. He also appeared to have developed a paranoia that she was seeing someone else and his suspicions would go overboard if she arrived home later than expected.  On Sunday evening the man allegedly punched her all over her body, pulling away the bed covers and saying: “This is how you’ll sleep tonight.”  The man, whose name is not being published to safeguard the identity of the alleged victim and the couple’s three children, pleaded not guilty to causing his wife to fear violence, subjecting her to moral and psychological violence, insulting and threatening her as well as causing her slight injuries.  He was also charged with wilfully damaging her mobile phone.  The woman, who on Wednesday was called into the courtroom midway through her husband’s arraignment, said she wanted ""to try to reconcile"" with her husband and that she had forgiven him.  “Even if it doesn’t seem to make sense or illogical, I don’t want to continue the proceedings. That’s my wish,” insisted the woman with Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil. “Is this your wish alone,"" the magistrate asked. “Yes and I say this consciously… no one forced me to,"" the alleged victim replied. “So you want to forgive him and stop the proceedings?” pressed the court. “Yes, please,” the woman said, as her husband sat in the dock. However, Micallef said she was not convinced about the woman’s decision, pointing out that there were times when her husband had contacted the alleged victim through his father. After consulting the Criminal Code and hearing what the parties had to say, the court ordered proceedings to continue.  The tearful woman walked out of the room, downcast and silent.  The accused’s defence team requested bail. The man could reside with his father who was present in court and also willing to step in as a third-party guarantor, argued lawyer Alfred Abela.  His criminal record was untainted and, if he were to risk his job, the children would suffer at the end of the day.  Given adequate bail conditions, including a protection order, “we may cater for this somewhat particular case"", the lawyers added.  However, the prosecutor objected, highlighting the serious nature of the charges which dated back “days, weeks, months and years”.  There was also a fear of future wrongdoing if the accused were to be released from arrest and if the wife were to change her mind about testifying, there was also fear of tampering with evidence.  The accused had already tried to communicate with her through his father while at the lockup, piling pressure on the victim, argued Micallef.  After hearing submissions, the court turned down the request, stating that in light of the nature of the charges, it lacked peace of mind that the accused would abide by bail conditions.  The court also issued a protection order and warned the accused of the serious consequences of breaching that order.  Inspector Audrey Micallef prosecuted.  Lawyers Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin were defence counsel. Legal procurator Colin Galea appeared parte civile.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Activists set up bed outside Castille lined with names of murdered women,Times of Malta,"Activists set up a bed inscribed with the names of murdered women outside the Office of the Prime Minister, in a bid to call on the government to do more to prevent domestic violence in Malta.  The group Young Progressive Beings (YPB) set up the makeshift bed on Tuesday afternoon and wrote down the names of women who were murdered by an intimate partner on the sheets.  Prominently, the name of Sandra Ramirez was among those listed on the installation.   RELATED STORIES  Ramirez, a 43-year-old Columbian national, was found stabbed to death in her bed last week. Police learned of the incident after her partner, Fabian Eliuth Garcia - also from Colombia, walked into a police station and gave himself up.  At Garcia’s arraignment on Sunday, police testified that the man went to the Sliema police station early Saturday morning with a Spanish-to-English translation app open on his phone. There he had written: ""I murdered my ex-partner in an argument inside my home"".  Garcia is pleading not guilty to the crime.    “The bed symbolises not just where Sandra Ramirez was murdered, but the intimate spaces where many of these crimes have taken place and the “trusted” people who were the perpetrators,” YPB said. “We call on the government of Malta to prioritise the prevention of intimate partner violence and domestic violence and bring the men who killed them to justice. Femicide is preventable.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Mtarfa couple charged with abusing young daughters granted bail,Edwina Brincat,"A couple who last week were charged with sexually abusing their young daughters for several years and covering it up were granted bail on Tuesday.  The husband, a 43-year-old deliveryman from Mtarfa, is pleading not guilty to defiling the couple’s two daughters, engaging in non-consensual sexual activity and subjecting them to acts of physical intimacy.  The mother, a 42-year-old housewife, who wept throughout her arraignment, pleaded not guilty to permitting the abuse and preventing the minors from reporting it.  The alleged ill-treatment surfaced when the younger girl, who turned 13 on the day of the couple’s arraignment, first opened up about the domestic situation with the mother of a friend during a sleepover.  Soon after the girl, accompanied by an adult, turned up at the Rabat police station to file a report, telling police about the abuse and claiming that her elder sister faced the same plight.  She also claimed their mother was aware of the situation but often warned her not to tell anyone.  Both girls later spoke to police in the presence of officials from the Child Protection Unit. Their allegations triggered investigations which ultimately resulted in criminal charges against both parents.  Upon arraignment, husband and wife pleaded not guilty. Both were denied bail.  Their case was assigned to a Magistrates’ Court which scheduled a first hearing on Tuesday. The couple, who at last week’s arraignment were assisted by a legal aid lawyer, had meanwhile engaged a personal lawyer who filed a fresh request for bail.  After hearing the elder daughter testify behind closed doors the court, presided over by Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, upheld the bail request in respect of both parents.  The mother was ordered to sign the bail book once a week, not to approach prosecution witnesses, particularly the younger daughter who is still to testify, and to bind herself under a personal guarantee of €5,000. The father was granted bail against a deposit of €800, a personal guarantee of €15,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under the strict condition of not approaching prosecution witnesses, especially his daughters.  The protection orders imposed by the court upon arraignment still stand as does the ban on the names of all parties.  The case continues. AG lawyer Darlene Grima and inspectors Godwin Scerri and Wayne Buhagiar are prosecuting.  Lawyer Roberto Montalto is defence counsel.

Traffic policemen cleared by court of overtime racket,Edwina Brincat,"Two sergeants from the police traffic section who were accused of involvement in a racket linked to extra duties during works on the Marsa flyover project have been acquitted of all criminal wrongdoing. Judgment was delivered in proceedings against Matthew Azzopardi, 45 and Francis Larry Sciberras, 55. They were charged in July 2020 with complicity in the racket whereby unlawful gains were allegedly obtained to the detriment of the police corps, Infrastructure Malta and/or Transport Malta. The amount allegedly received in unaccounted-for extra duty payments by the two accused totalled some €5,000. The two were also charged with making false declarations as well as committing an offence which, as public officials, they were duty-bound to prevent. They protested their innocence from the very start. It had all started when police received anonymous information that a number of police officers from the traffic section were allegedly stealing fuel, skiving work duties, towing vessels against payment and seeking protection money. Those allegations triggered a probe by the Anti-Money Laundering Squad which focused on the allegation that officers were skiving from work when they were supposed to be performing extra duties.  RELATED STORIES  Prosecuting inspector Lianne Bonello testified that in Azzopardi’s case, police found no evidence of his involvement in any other of the alleged irregularities. Extra duties were services offered by police officers upon the request of a person or entity against payment, according to agreed rates. When those extra duties are done during normal work hours, payment is due to the corps. The prosecution claimed that Azzopardi played a role in a conspiracy with other traffic officers to make unlawful gains through deceit and fraudulent means, claiming payments for services that were actually not rendered by him. Another sergeant, Norman Xuereb, was identified as the alleged brains behind the racket because he was the one who met Infrastructure Malta and Transport Malta to discuss payments. The prosecution claimed that several times, Azzopardi was not found in the area where he was supposed to be but moved about, occasionally tracked down in his home locality. And when he worked extra duties during work hours, he got payment which was rightly due to the corps. After hearing all testimonies and scrutinising all documentation the court, presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove the element of deceit that was one of the requisites of the offence under article 308 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution “completely failed” to produce proper evidence of the fraud allegedly committed through “deceit, devices or pretences” intended to persuade the victim to part with his money and thus suffer a loss. There was no evidence of some sort of communication between the accused and Xuereb to be assigned those duties. Even less so was there evidence that Azzopardi was instructed not to report for work, or to carry out extra duties during normal hours, or to do other duties not related to his detail. And when not found on the spot where he was detailed, there was no proof that he was conspiring with others to evade duties. The prosecution also alleged that certain officers used to swap duties but then failed to produce concrete and conclusive evidence to support this allegation. When all was considered the evidence was too “weak” to convince the court that the two accused were part of a racket and thus the accusation of complicity was not proved. Nor was there evidence that they made any false declaration or to mask something false as legitimate. There was no fraudulent information on the signed time sheets.  Even if the declarations in the invoices were not completely true and correct, the link to the accused was not satisfactorily proved. Moreover, the clients receiving the service never complained with the corps and nor did they ever seek a refund for services not rendered. Former IM chief Frederick Azzopardi testified that police presence had been necessary to expressly monitor the flow of traffic in the areas close to the Marsa project and other ancillary zones affected. The project, described by Transport Malta official, Clint Axisa as “the biggest project we ever had,” went on for two years in one of the island’s most strategic areas and inevitably caused chaos and disruption in the zones through which voluminous traffic flowed on a daily basis. That was why those entities had required both patrolling and static traffic policemen at the time. That evidence supported the version of the accused.  Lawyer Mario Buttigieg was defence counsel for Azzopardi. Lawyers Ludvic Caruana and Maxine Vassallo were counsel to Sciberras.

Candles and flowers at vigil for Sliema murder victim Sandra Ramirez,Giulia Magri,"Flowers and candles were laid out in a vigil for murder victim Sandra Ramirez on Monday evening. The 43-year-old Colombian woman was found stabbed to death in the bed of a Sliema rental apartment on Saturday morning.  Police learnt of the crime when 43-year-old Fabian Eliuth Garcia walked into the Sliema police station and told officers on duty that he had killed someone. He was arraigned on Sunday afternoon and is pleading not guilty.  Monica Zamora Salam shared the details of the vigil, held at the Independence Gardens in Sliema, on Instagram on Sunday evening. She said the vigil would pay tribute to Ramirez and also raise awareness about femicide and violence.    “Those who are interested in joining me can write to me, I will bring candles and flowers,” she said. Speaking to Times of Malta, Monica said she did not know Ramirez, but when she read the news she wanted to do something. ""I was shocked and I wanted to make sure that something was done for her,"" she said. She spoke to Ramirez's family back in Colombia, and said her relatives do not wish to speak to journalists. The vigil was attended by members of the Latino community, Sliema Mayour John Pillow and Honorary Consul of Colombia to Malta Joseph Buhagiar. Flowers and candles were laid at the site and the group held hands and prayed in Spanish. The site of the vigil is the same place where Paulina Dembska, a 29-year-old Polish student was violently murdered in January 2022. The murder horrified the nation and led to the introduction of femicide into the criminal code.    In comments to Times of Malta, Ramirez's employer Karl Micallef said she always had a smile on her face and was always there to help everyone.  “She was hard-working, kind, and always cheerful. Her laugh was special and filled the room,” he said. On Sunday, members of Malta’s Latino community packed the St Gregory the Great Church for Mass, in Spanish, dedicated to the memory of Ramirez.

Suspected drug trafficker arrested by police on third attempt in two months,Edwina Brincat,"A suspected drug trafficker arrested on the third attempt within two months was on Monday remanded in custody, while his partner, accused of helping him flee police officers, was also denied bail.  Morat Abdikadir Mohammed Naswanon had been on the police's wanted list for weeks. The 33-year old Libyan national who lives in Valletta has several drug-related brushes with the law. He landed back under police surveillance upon suspicion that he was once again trafficking drugs.  In November the police started surveilling Morat and his partner Judith Bakoush at a hotel in St Julian's. On November 24, officers stopped Morat outside the hotel entrance.  But just as a police officer was about to hand over the arrest warrant, Morat made a run for it and managed to escape. Inside the hotel room occupied by Morat the police found Bakoush and several drugs, including 22 packets of cocaine, seven ecstasy pills and two sachets of cannabis grass.  Bakoush was arraigned and her partner was placed on the police wanted list while investigations continued.  Although his registered address was at a Valletta residence, police checks showed that no Morat was living there.  Further investigations led police to a Qawra address.  But when officers moved in to raid the property on December 26, the wanted man fled through the back door.  The corps then turned on the public, asking for help to track down the man. Investigators meanwhile kept a close watch over his partner who was granted bail on December 20.  The woman breached bail conditions and visited the Qawra residence in the evening after curfew hours. She had been found there when Morat managed to get away.  That time, the inspector handling the investigations had warned her to abide by bail conditions. However she persisted in not signing her bail book at the Valletta police station. Further surveillance led investigators to a third locality - a Kirkop residence where last Saturday the couple were found, together with the owner of the property, Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca told court. This time, they managed to arrest both. Morat and Bakoush were arraigned separately on Monday.  Morat pleaded not guilty to possession of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ecstasy under circumstances denoting that the drugs were not solely for personal use.  He was further charged with failing to obey legitimate police orders, escaping from police custody, committing the crimes within 100 metres of a place frequented by youths as well as relapsing.  He pleaded not guilty.  His lawyers made no request for bail at arraignment stage.  As for Bakoush, she too pleaded not guilty to aiding her boyfriend to escape police and for allegedly breaching four bail decrees and relapsing.  Her lawyer, Franco Debono, pointed out that she had presented medical certificates to justify her failure to sign the bail book. But the prosecutor rebutted that Bakoush had only gone to the doctor on January 7.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution who highlighted the fact that Bakoush allegedly assisted Morat while he was on the run.  She was under four bail decrees, had skipped signing, was out after curfew hours and was staying at other places that were not her registered address.  Besides, other civilians including a third person who was still in hospital - were yet to to testify, argued Mercieca.  The court, presided over by magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request.  Inspector John Leigh Howard also prosecuted.  Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

€1.4m money transfers triggered probe into Konrad Mizzi associate,Jacob Borg,"“Suspicious” money transfers of €1.4 million triggered a probe into a close confidante of ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, Times of Malta can reveal.  Lawyer Aron Mifsud Bonnici ended up on the authorities’ radar after carrying out a series of large transfers to XNT Limited, a Malta-based investment firm. The transfers, the bulk of which started in the summer of 2020, raised tax evasion and money-laundering suspicions, as they appeared to exceed the lawyer’s expected wealth. Further red flags were raised due to Mifsud Bonnici’s previous involvement in numerous government entities, as well as his close ties with Mizzi, who resigned in November 2019 under a cloud of corruption.  A deeper dive into Mifsud Bonnici’s local bank accounts led the authorities to flag notable differences between his declared income and the hundreds of thousands of euros that flowed into his bank accounts annually since 2016. Financial documents seen by Times of Malta indicate Mifsud Bonnici received payments into his personal bank accounts of over €2.4 million between 2016 and 2019. However, during those same four years, Mifsud Bonnici declared a total income of €680,000. The income declarations do not include dividends received by Mifsud Bonnici from the community work scheme and other shareholdings, as tax on these would have been paid at company level. Nonetheless, the discrepancy triggered suspicions of tax evasion due to the difference between his income declarations and the money received in his accounts.  The police’s Financial Crimes Investigations Department have been in possession of information detailing the suspicions since August 2021, according to documents reviewed by Times of Malta. A police spokesman declined to comment when questioned by Times of Malta about the outcome of any investigations and the apparent lack of action against Mifsud Bonnici. Mifsud Bonnici told Times of Malta he has never been sent for by the police, nor been told he is being investigated. He said the money transferred to XNT came from “declared retained earnings from my profession, and dividends that are taxed at source”. The lawyer added there is nothing for the police to investigate, as all taxable income had been appropriately declared to the authorities. He said the payments he received bet­ween 2016 and 2019 include expenses that need to be deducted prior to declaring his income. “Your rendering gives a partial and flawed result, since you have left out all expenses direct and indirect, thus giving an eschewed picture, with disregard to the true and complete picture of the accounts,” Mifsud Bonnici said. A spokesperson for XNT said the company could not comment on “specific details” due to client confidentiality. “XNT Limited reiterate that they have always adhered strictly to all anti money laundering legislation whether local or under EU regulations. “Even in this particular case of Dr Mifsud Bonnici, our clients state that, as is always done with all of their clients, all the necessary due diligence was done and all required documents were passed on to them and all documents were duly verified,” XNT’s lawyers José Herrera and David Camilleri said. XNT Limited was fined by Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) last year for lax internal anti-money laundering controls. The fine was overturned on appeal. This is not the first time that Mifsud Bonnici has been on the police’s radar. In 2022, the local authorities sought help from the United States on cryptocurrency transfers between Mifsud Bonnici and murder suspect Yorgen Fenech. US court filings show the request is linked to an ongoing court case against Fenech to buy a Glock Firearm and Scorpion CZ automatic rifle over the dark web in November 2018. Investigations indicate that Mifsud Bonnici transferred the bitcoins to Fenech on the same day he ordered the firearms. Both men deny wrongdoing. Fenech has been charged with orchestrating the October 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. He denies the charges. The murder suspect has also been linked to corruption with Konrad Mizzi, having profited from Enemalta’s purchase of the Montenegro wind farm, via secret offshore companies. Mifsud Bonnici was a close associate to Mizzi during his time in government. He acted as a legal advisor during the Vitals Global Healthcare deal, which has been mired in fraud and corruption claims. He was also appointed by Mizzi as Ene­malta’s board secretary and was involved in talks leading up to the Montenegro wind farm project.

Man arrested following series of snatch-and-grab thefts in Fgura,Times of Malta,"A 25-year-old man is being held under arrest in connection with a series of snatch-and-grab thefts in Fgura. The suspect, who lives in Cospicua, was arrested a short while after two women aged 45 and 80 and a man aged 74 filed separate police reports in Paola on Thursday alleging that they had been robbed while walking on the street. He is also believed to have stolen a 74-year-old man’s wallet after shoving him on Triq il-Mater Boni Consilii the previous day. The 45-year-old woman told the police that she had just withdrawn money from an ATM on Triq Hompesch at 6pm on Thursday when a man snatched the money out of her hand and ran away and headed towards Triq il-Karmelitani. The suspect is believed to have then snatched a bag that the 74-year-old man was carrying and a mobile phone from the 80-year-old woman’s hand. At around 8.30pm on Thursday, police officers identified a man matching the description given by the crime victims in the Triq il-Karmelitani area of Fgura. He was immediately placed under arrest and is being held in police custody. Prosecutors intend to arraign him on Saturday before magistrate Leonard Caruana.

Woman found stabbed to death in Sliema as suspect turns himself in,Times of Malta,"Updated 1.30pm A Colombian woman was murdered in Sliema on Saturday morning.  Police learnt of the murder when a 43-year-old Colombian man walked into the Sliema police station at 6.15am and told officers on duty that he had killed someone.  His clothes appeared to be stained with blood.  The victim, 43-year-old Sandra Ramirez, was found stabbed in the bed of a rental apartment on Triq Sir George Borg.    Officers believe the victim and suspect had argued. Initial indications are that the woman was the suspect's ex-girlfriend. Social media posts suggest the two were close and had travelled abroad together as recently as November. Times of Malta is not publishing photos of the victim or suspect until relatives in Colombia have been informed of the crime.  There is no record of the two having ever filed any criminal complaints or domestic violence reports against one another, police said.  The suspect is being held under arrest and is being interrogated. Ramirez worked at a retail outlet at The Point shopping mall in Sliema. The store remained shut on Saturday, as employees grieved.  ""Today we tragically lost a member of our family, not just a member of our staff, a note posted to the store shutter along with a black ribbon read. ""Sandra Ramirez was a kind, gentle and hard-working woman who was loved by us all at Mavenry.""    A police spokesperson told journalists that police officers were still searching for the murder weapon. Sources said officers are also obtaining CCTV footage from various properties in the area, to trace the victim and suspect's movements in the hours preceding the murder. The murder victim obtained a residence permit in October 2022 while the suspected killer came to Malta in January 2023, immigration records indicate. Officers are now speaking to Colombian consular officials to obtain more information about the victim and suspect, as well as to establish contact with their respective families.  Magistrate Lara Lanfranco will lead an inquiry into the case.   It is the second murder of 2024, following the New Year's Day shooting of Eric Borg in Rabat.

Killing Paulina and Ashling,Times of Malta,"In January 2021, two women were brutally killed in Malta and Ireland, two countries on opposite sides of the European continent. Paulina Dembska was cornered, raped and killed at Sliema’s Independence Gardens on January 2, 2021. Ten days later, Ashling Murphy was killed as she jogged along the banks of a canal in the Irish midlands. Both women simply happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Both cases sparked a collective sense of grief with vigils held in Ireland and Malta.  Fast-forward to the present and the contrasting progress in the legal proceedings for the accused men underscores a critical issue plaguing Malta’s justice system. Murphy’s killer, Jozef Puska, was convicted last November and handed a life sentence, providing some semblance of closure to her grieving family and the Irish community. In stark contrast, the case against Abner Aquilina, the alleged murderer of Dembska, remains ensnared in the protracted compilation-of-evidence phase. Last week, Dembska’s family shared the agonising pain of reliving the trauma through lengthy court proceedings, saying that true closure can only be achieved when the accused is sentenced. Her eldest brother, Łukasz Dembski, told Times of Malta: “The case is taking too long. We all know who took the life of our sister. I have the impression that the accused received more psychological help than our entire family.” The family has no choice but to relive the nightmare repeatedly, sitting through or reading the horrific court testimonies. And there is no end in sight.  The slow-moving wheels of justice, often exacerbated by weak investigations and never-ending magisterial inquiries, are now a chronic problem. It is also the trademark of a country weighed down by bureaucracy and misplaced resources. The Maltese government appears to be acknowledging the need for reform – proposed amendments to shorten the compilation-of-evidence stage to one year would do wonders to trim down the duration of court cases. The White Paper introduced last May seeks to empower the attorney general to expedite cases when the penalty does not exceed 12 years. One key aspect of the reforms is the elimination of the ‘referral’ process, a bureaucratic hurdle that often prolongs the compilation phase. But there are major concerns whether any proposed changes can be done in practice. The shortage of judges and the limited facilities available for trials by jury pose significant obstacles. So too does the limited pool of talented prosecutors at the Attorney General’s Office, which has been decimated by a series of defections and promotions. Unless the government invests heavily in judicial resources and infrastructure, any proposed changes will sadly remain on (white) paper and justice will continue being delayed. And until that happens  dozens of families will continue suffering in silence: Lassana Cissè was gunned down in 2019 for being black – his alleged killers are out on bail, awaiting trial. Eleonor Mangion Walker was found dead in 2016, her body dumped under wooden pallets in a warehouse. The accused is still awaiting trial by jury. Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in 2017 for doing her job. The triggermen have been convicted but the man charged with conspiring to kill her is still sitting through the reopened compilation of evidence. There are too many cases to chronicle here. Swift and fair justice is not only a right for the victims and their families but also a cornerstone of a functioning and compassionate society. The comments made by Dembska’s family last week are a poignant reminder that justice delayed is justice denied. Malta and Ireland may be located at opposite sides of Europe but geographical distance should not translate into a significant gap when it comes to the pursuit of justice.

World-renowned UK conductor charged with child sex crimes,AFP,"World-renowned British conductor Jan Latham-Koenig has been charged with child sexual offences, London’s Metropolitan Police said on Friday. Latham-Koenig was the first British-born conductor to become artistic director of a Russian opera company, and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2020 for services to music and UK-Russia cultural relations. “Jan Latham-Koenig, 70,... was arrested at London Victoria Train station on Wednesday 10 January,” the police force said in a statement. “He was charged the following day... with arranging/facilitating a child sexual offence and sexual communication with a child,” it added. During his time at the Novaya Opera (New Opera), he staged Moscow’s premiere of Richard Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde, one of the cornerstones of Western classical music. The Novaya Opera was founded by former Moscow city mayor Yuri Luzhkov to be an opera for the people – cheaper and more accessible than the better-known Bolshoi. Its founding director Yevgeny Kolobov was universally admired but the house then floundered after his death in 2003, rediscovering its momentum under Latham-Koenig’s leadership. Latham-Koenig was due to appear at London’s Westminster Magistrates Court on Friday, police said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Two teenagers arrested in St Paul's Bay following theft from jewellery shop,Times of Malta,"Two teenagers were arrested in St Paul's Bay following the theft of jewellery items from a shop on Triq Dawret il-Gżejjer. The 17-year-olds, from Sweden, were first spotted at around 3.45pm by police officers on patrol on Triq il-Merluzz. When the teenagers saw the officers, they fled, with the officers giving chase.  The officers managed to catch up with one of them, while the other one fled the scene. At that same moment, the officers were informed of a theft from the shop. The two young men that had just been chased by the police fitted the description of the suspected thieves. The police said in a statement that while the youngster was getting into the police car, he threw away a golden bracelet. The police searched for the other young man at his residence, where they found another golden bracelet and a watch, also stolen from the shop. The two are expected to be charged in court in the coming days.  Police investigations are ongoing.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

'It's bicarbonate of soda': man charged with possession of cocaine tells police,Edwina Brincat,"A man tracked down inside a hotel room with drugs in his possession told police officers he was carrying bicarbonate of soda in his backbag. Denis Cremona was found in a St Paul's Bay hotel after the court issued an arrest warrant when he failed to sign a bail book and attend proceedings over drug-related charges. The car of the 48-year-old, who has no fixed address, was spotted outside the hotel on Thursday. Checks at the hotel led the officers to Cremona, who was staying inside a room which, when searched, yielded an amount of drugs.  A suspicious substance - which Cremona insisted was bicarbonate of soda - was found inside his backbag.  Sachets of suspected heroin and cocaine, as well as drug-related paraphernalia, were also found inside a sofa. He was arrested shortly before 1pm on Thursday. Within 24 hours, he was escorted to court and charged with possession of cocaine and heroin under circumstances denoting the drugs were not intended solely for personal use. He was also charged with committing the alleged offences during the operative period of a suspended sentence that was confirmed on appeal in January 2023.  The accused pleaded not guilty.  A request for bail was objected to in view of the accused’s untrustworthiness.  Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb countered that the law provided for treatment rather than imprisonment in case of drug dependence in terms of Chapter 537 of the laws of Malta.  As for the alleged breach of bail, nothing was put forward about that issue in court. Moreover, the prosecution did not mention any civilian witnesses and the consequent fear of tampering with evidence, argued the defence.  However, after hearing submissions by both parties the court, presided over by Magistrate Lara Lanfranco, turned down the request.  Inspector Christian Cauchi prosecuted.

Three out of five FIAU fines issued in 2023 remain unpaid,Matthew Xuereb,"More than 60 per cent of the fines issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit last year are unpaid. According to information given in parliament by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, the FIAU issued a total of €3.36 million in administrative fines against 144 companies or individuals. Of these, only €1.4 million were paid by 96 subject persons. He was replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Jerome Caruana Cilia. Caruana said that one must keep in mind that fines determined by the anti-money laundering body can be changed following a court decision. Moreover, when an FIAU decision is appealed before the court, the fine established by the body is not paid because that penalty is not considered final. It is only paid after a court decision. The court has challenged several fines issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit over the past years, with different judges ruling against its “dangerous” system in the imposition of fines since it was acting as prosecutor, judge and juror. The constitutional court also declared the fines as being unconstitutional as they breached people’s fundamental right to a fair hearing before an independent court. Last year, one judge described the system the FIAU was using as “institutionalised incest”. “Without case law and jurisprudential teachings, even common sense dictates that such punishments… penalties, call them what you may, must be imposed by a court as constitutionally known… and not by a body of an administrative nature that operates in an opaque manner and [laden] with conflicts and interests,” Mr Justice Toni Abela ruled. There were at least five decisions against the anti-money laundering watchdog, with many other cases still pending before the constitutional court. According to information given in parliament last October, the FIAU had 21 constitutional cases filed against it. Until then, the unit spent €147,000 in legal fees. In 2019, the unit imposed 19 fines and collected a mere €37,000. The following year, the unit issued 170 fines and collected just over €2.1 million, including fines that had been pending since 2016. In 2021, the FIAU issued 176 administrative fines and collected almost €1.2 million in fines, including one pending since 2018. In 2022, the FIAU issued 145 fines and collected €3.5 million.

Court confirms six-year jail term for man convicted of rape on first date,Edwina Brincat,"A man who was sentenced to six years imprisonment for raping a woman he met on a blind date has had his punishment confirmed on appeal. The case dates back to August 2019 when 27-year old Tyson Grech went to a wine bar with the victim after the two had met on social media. The then-19 year old woman later told police how that evening they ordered wine and after drinking one glass she declined more since she was not accustomed to drink. But her companion insisted and she ended up having two more glasses. They left the bar and walked to his car, but from then on, she had no other recollections. The following morning she woke up in unfamiliar surroundings, finding herself in her underwear, an ache in her private parts and Grech lying next to her on the bed. In spite of her repeated refusal, he forced her to have sex, doing so twice and later gave her a ride home. At first she did not intend to report the matter to the police but after speaking to her mother and officers from Appoġġ, she changed her mind. Grech was eventually charged with rape, non-consensual sex, holding the woman against her will and breaching bail, as well as recidivism. In 2021, he was found guilty of rape and breach of bail by a Magistrates’ Court and condemned to a six-year effective jail term and fined €2200. A further €2800 in bail money was also to be confiscated. Grech appealed on several grounds, including his claim that there were inconsistencies in the victim’s version. When delivering judgment on Thursday the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri, concluded that although there were certain inconsistencies, that did not mean that the victim’s version was untrue. The woman was scared and did not at first plan to file a report. Even when testifying, she appeared reluctant to divulge certain details. However her attitude was composed and fearful, sometimes bursting into tears. On the other hand, Grech came across as “arrogant,” seemingly proud to have had sex with the victim “three times.” The judge concluded that any inconsistencies in the woman's version were not so substantial as to make the court doubt what she said. Even if she had consented to sex in the evening, that did not mean that she did so the following morning, when she repeatedly told Grech, “no, I don’t want.” The appellant produced footage at appeal stage which he claimed to have retrieved from the “cloud.” But that video appeared to show a sexual session in the dark and even if it was meant to prove that the victim had consented first time round, that did not mean that she consented next morning. Besides, the figures in that footage were not identifiable, the court said. Nor did the appellant prove that his mother was at the flat at the time of the alleged rape. As for the punishment, the judge concluded that it tended towards the minimum in terms of law. The appeal was rejected and the punishment confirmed together with the ban on publications of the victim’s name. Inspector Eman Hayman prosecuted.

"Man accused of molesting pedestrians, resisting police",Edwina Brincat,"A man who allegedly molested passersby in Valletta on Wednesday and put up a violent struggle when the police turned up, has been taken to court and remanded in custody.   Prosecutors said a report was made to Valletta police station on Wednesday about a man, later identified as 24-year old Damien Attard, who was molesting people in Republic Street. When police officers approached him he reacted aggressively, insulting and spitting at them. He put up a struggle when they tried to arrest him. After he was finally arrested and taken to the police station, he kept up his aggressive stance and hurt one of the officers. Attard was escorted to the court in handcuffs on Thursday and remained handcuffed until Magistrate Noel Bartolo caught sight of the metal restraints behind the accused’s back and asked why they were still on.  “He was still rather agitated,” explained the prosecuting officers. The magistrate ordered the escorting officers to remove the cuffs and the accused to sit down quietly. Attard then pleaded not guilty to attacking and violently resisting four police officers, insulting and threatening them, slightly injuring one of them, refusing to obey legitimate orders, wilfully breaching public peace, swearing, relapsing and also breaching two bail decrees. Defence lawyer Franco Debono asked whether the accused had told police that he had been attacked “by other persons” in Wednesday’s incident. Inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Daryl Borg said that it all started when the accused began to molest passersby. He did mention that “someone” had confronted him but he could not identify that person. That was when the trouble started but as soon as police arrived, Attard did not give them the chance to speak. He behaved aggressively and used physical violence against the officers, said the prosecutors. A request for bail was objected to because the accused was deemed untrustworthy and also because of the gravity of the charges. This was not the first time Attard landed in trouble for attacking public officials and had in fact, been convicted of similar charges by a Magistrates’ Court. Besides, the address on the police system was not the accused’s current address and that in itself amounted to a breach of bail, prosecutors said. The defence countered that the accused was presumed innocent and there was no fear of tampering with evidence since the main witnesses were police officers. There was also some doubt in respect of the dynamics of the incident. The court rejected the request for bail in light of the nature of the offences and the fact that the accused did not offer the necessary guarantees in terms of law. Inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Daryl Borg prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Teenager in court for threatening his mother,Edwina Brincat,"A young man has been refused bail after being accused of threatening his mother and causing her to fear violence. The mother filed a police report against her 17-year-old son, a drug addict, a few days after Christmas after he crept up behind her brandishing a knife.  The teenager, accompanied in court by his father, stood blank-faced, hands limp at his sides throughout a hearing during which he pleaded not guilty to causing his mother fear of violence, insulting and threatening her and misusing  electronic communications equipment. Prosecuting Inspector Audrey Micallef explained how last Tuesday his mother had filed a police report about her son who had been making use of illicit substances for the past three years. She had been warning him to take care of his health, pleading with him to kick the habit, and there were many times when she had stopped short of reporting him to the police. But the situation came to a head after Christmas. On that occasion, there had been no arguments between mother and son. So the woman got a terrible shock when she turned round and found the teen standing right behind her with a knife in his hand. “You thought it would be the last day of your life, didn’t you,” he told her, evidently sensing her shock. After that episode, the mother began to receive life-threatening messages from her son. Unable to bear it any longer, she went to the police. When summoned by the police, the teen replied, “if you want to talk to me, you come.” Following that call from the police, the teen upped his dose of messages to his mother, peppering his messages with insulting and offensive language. The teen pleaded not guilty and said that he had recently landed a job at a retail store. A request for bail was objected to in view of the fear of tampering with evidence, especially since the alleged victim is still to testify and also because of the serious nature of the offences. Although his criminal record was “not alarming” the situation on the home front had been ongoing for three years and there was fear that he might commit further wrongdoing if granted bail, argued the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Martina Herrera, assisting the accused as legal aid, argued that the teen was still presumed innocent and he was trying to turn his life round after going through a rough patch. “The drug problem has greatly improved since I started working,” piped in the teen, in a calm and soft voice. He had also been to Caritas and lived with his father, added the defence. “So how was his mother involved?” asked presiding Magistrate Noel Bartolo. Parte civile lawyer Mario Buttigieg stepped in, explaining that the mother was so scared that she left the family home and moved to their summer residence. Her son had only been to Caritas for a couple of days. The parents wished to put their son back on track and were hoping for a treatment order in that respect, said Buttigieg. The prosecutor pointed out that the accused had confessed that “the problem” still existed but he expressed “a great wish” to address it. After hearing submissions the court turned down the request for bail and recommended that, in view of the fact that the accused was a minor, he be detained at YOURS, the young offenders unit. The court also upheld the request for a treatment order, explaining its implications to the teen and warning him of the consequences if he were not to follow orders given by those persons who would be monitoring him. The court also banned publication of all parties’ names to safeguard the interests of the minor. Lawyer Helga Buttigieg Debono also appeared parte civile.

South Africa accuses Israel of breaching Genocide Convention,AFP,"South Africa on Thursday accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention, saying that even the October 7 Hamas attack could not justify such alleged actions. Pretoria has lodged an urgent appeal to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Israel to ""immediately suspend"" its military operations in Gaza. Israel has dismissed the case as ""atrocious"" and ""preposterous"".  RELATED STORIES  ""No armed attack on a state territory no matter how serious... can provide justification for or defend breaches of the convention,"" said Pretoria's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. ""Israel's response to the October 7 attack has crossed this line and given rise to the breaches of the convention,"" he added, setting out South Africa's case at the ICJ. The war in Gaza erupted when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack, which resulted in about 1,140 people killed in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,357 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. South Africa argues Israel is breaking its commitments under the UN Genocide Convention, a treaty signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust. Top lawyer for South Africa Adila Hassim said Israel's bombing campaign aimed at the ""destruction of Palestinian life"" and had pushed Palestinians ""to the brink of famine"". ""Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts,"" she said. As a fellow signatory to the treaty, South Africa can take Israel to the ICJ, which rules on disputes between countries and is often described as the ""World Court"". The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel. South Africa has acknowledged the ""particular weight of responsibility"" of accusing Israel of genocide. It has ""unequivocally"" condemned the Hamas attacks that touched off the war in Gaza. Israel will present its own arguments Friday but President Isaac Herzog has already hinted at his country's likely defence. ""There's nothing more atrocious and preposterous than this claim,"" said Herzog. ""We will present proudly our case of using self defence... under international humanitarian law,"" he said.  RELATED STORIES  Herzog said the Israeli army was ""doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties"". The United States is backing its ally Israel, with the State Department describing the charges as ""unfounded"". ""In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews,"" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. As it is an urgent procedure, the ICJ could rule in a matter of weeks. Its rulings are final and cannot be appealed. However, countries do not always follow the court's verdicts - the ICJ has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, for example. But a court ruling against Israel would certainly increase political pressure on the country, with many speculating it could serve as a pretext for sanctions. Cecily Rose, assistant professor of public international law at Leiden University, said the court did not have to rule on the fundamentals of the case at this stage - that issue will likely take years. ""Instead, the court would only be evaluating whether there is a risk of irreparable prejudice to rights held under the Genocide Convention, in particular the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts that threaten their existence as a group,"" Rose told AFP.

"Murders in Malta are increasingly involving firearms, data indicates",Matthew Xuereb,"The use of firearms for murders has been constantly on the increase, with guns being used for more than a third of murders in the last five years, up from a quarter in the previous five, according to crime historian Eddie Attard. The three homicides in 2023, however  – two women and a man were killed – did not involve the use of a firearm, while a shotgun was used in the first murder of 2024. Attard, a former police officer, said that with three murders in 2023, Malta still has among the lowest homicide rates and is one of only a handful of countries where no murders took place in a particular year.  RELATED STORIES  Since the beginning of the 21st century, there have been two years, 2003 and 2006, when no homicides occured. However, while in the past one woman was killed for every two men, that trend is now reversed: there were years when more women were killed than men, or the number of women killed was equal to that of men. Since 2019, Malta has had 23 homicides. In approximately 70% of the cases, the victim or the accused person was a foreigner. The first homicide of 2023 took place on January 18 when Pelin Kaya was walking in front of the Paul and Rocco service station in Gżira when a BMW S6 driven by Jeremie Camilleri, veered sideways, hitting her and the petrol station before crashing into a fast-food restaurant. Kaya, a 30-year-old interior designer originally from Turkey, had been on her way to meet her boyfriend after celebrating her 30th birthday with friends. She was taken to Mater Dei Hospital but died sometime later. Footage had captured the moment of impact as well as the driver getting out and flinging stones at the victim as she lay on the pavement, motionless.  Camilleri is pleading not guilty to her murder. The murder is one of just four in Malta's criminal history that was allegedly carried out voluntarily using a vehicle, Attard noted.  Almost nine months later – on October 15 – Malta witnessed the double murder of a couple from Marsa. A 34-year-old Ghanaian national, Iddrisu Faisal, is pleading not guilty to the murder of his landlords Joe Bartolo and his partner, Carmen Abela. They were both stabbed to death inside their residence along Triq it-Tiġrija, in Marsa. A bolt cutter is believed to have been used. Faisal was seen walking away from the crime scene, bare-chested, carrying a long metal object, raising his arms while shouting ‘Allahu akbar’, it emerged in court. Faisal also stands charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm in respect of a brother and sister who were renting rooms at the former horse-riding school where the murders took place. During the compilation of evidence against Faisal, the court heard two other co-tenants testify about how Bartolo regretted taking in Faisal as a tenant after rent-related arguments repeatedly broke out between them. Matters came to a head on that Sunday morning. A neighbour cleaning out bird cages on the roof of his residence across the street from the Marsa stables had reported hearing screams. He saw a Black man banging with all his might on the farmhouse door with a long metal object. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Thief arrested after being spotted by victim,Edwina Brincat,"A jobless asylum seeker who stole a mobile phone, a speaker and clothes over a three-day span was jailed on Wednesday after one of his victims spotted him walking in the street. Alataya Abdelazim Omer Ibrahim, a 23-year old Sudanese resident at Hal Far Open Centre, stole an iPhone worth €1,300 and a Bluetooth speaker worth €45 belonging to a Valletta restaurant on January 5. Three days later he stole clothes from two Sliema stores. The suspected thief was clearly visible on CCTV footage from the Valletta restaurant but his identity was initially unknown, the court was told.  But he was tracked down after the restaurant owner spotted him in Sliema. The clothes found in his possession turned out to have been stolen. The man was arrested and arraigned in court where he admitted to the theft of electronic equipment and the clothes. He told police that he stole the clothes because he was “feeling cold” and had nowhere to live. Assisted by an interpreter and a legal aid lawyer, he registered an admission and the court, presided by magistrate Victor George Axiak, condemned him to an 8-month effective jail term. AG lawyer Manuel Grech prosecuted together with inspectors Gabriel Micallef and Daryl Borg. Lawyer Martin Fenech was legal aid counsel.

"Today's front pages – January 10, 2024",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Wednesday. Times of Malta leads with comments by relatives of Paulina Dembska, who was raped and murdered two years ago. In the first interview since her murder, they denounce court delays and say the alleged killer appears to be receiving more psychological help than his victim’s family. The newspaper separately reports that the CEO of Project Green is expected to resign and eventually run for the European Parliament election in June. Both The Malta Independent and MaltaToday report that a court has shot down an attempt by Joseph Muscat to force Repubblika to present two court applications that originally triggered a magisterial inquiry into the hospitals' privatisation deal. In a separate article, The Malta Independent reports the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life ruled that the Prime Minister did not breach ethics over a sponsored video uploaded on social media over a year ago. MaltaToday meanwhile reports that according to Malta’s secret service, the MSS, while terrorism prevention is at the top of its agenda, its workload has been characterised by investigations against drug trafficking and illegal migration, as well as cyber threats to critical infrastructure. In-Nazzjon leads with news that cold temperatures are expected to last into next week. It also reports that 13 teachers resigned in the first three months of the current scholastic year.  L-orizzont leads its front page with news of 568 reports of domestic violence by children on their parents in 2023.

‘Our sister’s alleged killer appears to be receiving more help than us’,Giulia Magri,"The relatives of Paulina Dembska, who was raped and murdered two years ago, have denounced court delays and said the alleged killer appears to be receiving more psychological help than his victim’s family. The murder of the 29-year-old Polish student in the heart of Sliema on January 2, 2022, horrified the country and led to the introduction of femicide into the criminal code. Speaking to Times of Malta for the first time since the murder, the victim’s sister and brother came together to pay tribute to the young woman and call for speedier justice. The family members say their pain is exacerbated by lengthy court proceedings.  RELATED STORIES  “The longer the case takes place, and the accused is not judged, we, as family and friends, cannot start mourning,” Paulina’s sister, Daria Dembska said. Her eldest brother, Łukasz Dembski, added: “I can only say that the case is taking too long. We all know who took the life of our sister. “I have the impression that the accused received more psychological help than our entire family. I believe the accused should go directly to prison and the punishment should fit the crime.” A passer-by had found Paulina’s body just before 6.30am below the popular Sliema promenade, a short distance from the so-called cat village, where the Polish woman fed and took care of local strays.   The accused, Abner Aquilina, who proclaimed himself as “the antichrist”, is pleading not guilty to the crime. Court experts said he was “insane” during the act. The youngest of five siblings, Paulina first visited Malta in 2018 and instantly fell in love with the island. From being quiet and reserved, her siblings noticed Paulina coming out of her shell after visiting Malta to study English. “As a child, she was very sporty, she used to take part in running competitions, liked to go snowboarding and was also very sensitive towards animals,” Łukasz said. But tragedy hit the family when their brother, Mateus, 20, died in a car accident. Paulina, 15 at the time, was shocked. “Perhaps because she was the youngest, she didn’t understand. She closed off and was very selective with people. She started to read a lot of books and spent her free time helping animals.” But the family noticed Paulina changing during her visits to Malta.   “We all saw that she started to open up more towards people. She was more confident and I saw she was very happy,” Daria said. “She used to joke it was the vitamin ‘M’, for Malta,” she said. Paulina visited Malta four times, always during the winter, as she suffered in the hot summer weather, and would send pictures daily to her family. At the time of her murder, she was completing her studies in social work at Wroclaw University, in Poland and, every few months, she would travel to Malta to study English. When she was in Poland, she would help their elderly parents with errands and doctor visits and work part-time to save up for her studies in Malta. “She was a genuinely good person,” Daria said.   Before she was murdered, Paulina spent the summer with her brother and his girlfriend in their flat in Poland and he last saw her before she flew back to Malta in October 2021. The last time they spoke was to exchange New Year’s Day wishes on the phone, a day before she was killed. Daria said: “I spoke to her just three hours before she was killed. Our mother had booked a week trip to Malta at the beginning of January and they planned to travel back to Poland together.” Paulina had plans to start voluntary work in Italy in February, where she was to learn to assist and care for addicts. “She asked me to join our mother for the holiday in Malta.” On the day of her murder, the family noticed that Paulina was not answering any messages but they thought she was having internet issues. But, soon, horror hit home. Daria found out about her sister’s murder through a friend, who shared news reports. She contacted the Maltese police but she was told that all the information was passed on to the Polish consul. It was the hostel staff where Paulina was staying who confirmed the identity of the victim.   Daria had to relay the tragic news to her parents: “It was the hardest sentence I ever said in my life. I think I will never see them smile again. The last time I saw them happy was at the end of that December.” Paulina’s death also impacted the siblings, who recall how they did not feel safe when they were outside, constantly fearing someone was following them. “It’s hard for me to visit my parents, sit around the table and not see Paulina. Our mother says that parents visit their children for dinner and birthdays but now she visits her children at the cemetery.” Daria said Paulina’s death has affected her mental health and that of her young family. “Our family life changed a lot. She used to visit often and help us with our young daughter.” Daria visited Malta three times since her sister’s death, the first time to identify Paulina’s body and the last for a court hearing. Her brother also flew to Malta in July 2022 to sit for a court hearing but that day Aquilina did not show up in court. The family say they have taken comfort in the support they have received from the Maltese community.  They were touched by a mural in the memory of Paulina at the Sliema site and thanked artists Justine Peel, Melanie Vella, Elaine Wirth and Julia Grech.  Daria also thanked Paulina's friend Agnieszka Gramala, lawyer Lara Dimitrijevic, and Roberta Metsola, who dedicated her European Parliament presidency to Paulina and other female murder victims.  They have been in contact with the local council as well as an artist to design a red chair in the cat park their sister loved to go to. The idea came about from a similar installation in Italy, named ‘Posto Occupato’ (Seat Taken), a seat dedicated to all women victims of violence.

Easing re-export of artworks could facilitate money laundering PN MP warns,Daniel Ellul,"A new law aimed at enabling the re-export of cultural items owned by foreigners who move to Malta could be used to facilitate money laundering, PN MP Darren Carabott warned on Tuesday.   He was speaking during a parliamentary debate on a bill that would amend the Cultural Heritage Act.   ""There is a danger that people use works of art for illicit purposes, something that has been going on for years across the world,"" Carabott said.   ""Transnational criminality often hides behind actions that seem well-intentioned.""   Should the new law pass through parliament, people who move to Malta and bring works of art or other cultural items with them, would be able to take them out of Malta once more without hindrance. The bill means that the government will renounce the right of preference and the right to prohibit the re-exportation or movement of those cultural items. The items have to be declared before they are brought to Malta, and ownership must be proven.  Cultural Minister Owen Bonnici told the House on Monday that several art collectors or other high-net-worth individuals wanted to move to Malta with their collections. Still, their advisers often warned that current regulations would make it difficult for them to take their collections out of Malta should they decide to return to their country of origin.  While agreeing with the spirit of the law, Carabott pointed out risks that the new amendments might bring.   He said prices of works of art acquired legally were sometimes inflated to launder money.  ""Someone who has money from criminal actions, like drug trafficking, can buy works of art with dirty money, which are eventually exhibited in galleries"".  Other works could have been stolen and then sold several times.   ""The artwork's new owner might not know it, but that work might have come from illegal origins"".   On Monday, PN MPs Julie Zahra and Claudette Buttigieg raised similar concerns. Replying, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici insisted that any works brought to Malta from abroad must be accompanied by evidence proving ownership.   The bill's second reading was approved.  The bill will now go to committee before a final vote in the House.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Driver arrested after crashing into White House gate: Secret Service,AFP,"US authorities detained a person near the White House on Monday who crashed a vehicle into an exterior gate of the presidential mansion complex, the Secret Service said. President Joe Biden was out of town at the time of the incident, and security officials did not say whether it was a traffic accident or intended as an attack. ""Shortly before 6pm (2300 GMT), a vehicle collided with an exterior gate on the White House complex. The driver has been taken into custody and we are investigating the cause and manner of the collision,"" US Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on X, formerly Twitter. The crash is believed to have occurred on the northeast side of the complex, given that Guglielmi said to expect ""traffic implications"" at 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. While the vehicle was later cleared by Washington police, the ""driver remains in custody and our investigation continues"", Guglielmi said. The White House has seen a string of high-profile trespassing incidents in recent years, causing sufficient concern to build a higher, tougher metal fence around the iconic mansion's perimeter in 2020. In 2017 a man who scaled a White House fence traipsed the grounds for more than 16 minutes before he was arrested - while then-president Donald Trump was inside. In 2014 while Barack Obama was president, a disturbed US Army veteran jumped the White House fence, sprinted across the lawn and entered the building with a knife in his pocket.

Why a murder suspect in psychiatric care was allowed a gun licence,Matthew Xuereb,"Murder suspect Noel Azzopardi kept his gun licence because the police do not make medical checks on anyone applying to renew a weapons licence, it has emerged. The 39-year-old, who had a licence to carry and possess weapons, is accused of murdering Eric Borg, who was shot twice in his hometown of Rabat on New Year’s Day. Azzopardi is understood to have held a licence since he was 18 and was able to keep it despite receiving psychiatric treatment since 2016 and being under the care of a psychiatrist since then. It transpires that due diligence conducted by the police when renewing a person’s licence to possess and use a weapon simply consists of a background check on its system, which flags whether the person was recently convicted of a crime or whether he or she is wanted over anything specific.   A spokesperson for the Malta Police Force told Times of Malta that “when a person applies for a firearms licence, a medical certificate stating whether the person is physically and mentally fit to have and use a firearm is mandatory”. He added that when the licence is up for renewal, the police conduct an exercise on its system to check whether any red flags were raised. The renewal process does not include a requirement to disclose relevant medical conditions. Issues of a psychiatric nature would have to be reported to the police for this to be flagged by the system, which includes traffic contraventions and convictions. A firearms license is renewed every January, unless red flags emerge. If a person is applying for a hunter’s licence, he or she must be registered with a recognised association.  A number of firearms were seized from Azzopardi’s house during a search following the murder. He also had access to other weapons and ammunition since his father is also a licensed hunter. The police have been unable to establish a motive for the murder of Borg, 27, who was shot twice at about 3pm on New Year’s Day in Triq il-Fidloqqom, Rabat. Azzopardi’s lawyers requested that his medical records, especially those related to Mount Carmel Hospital, be presented in court. He is being held at the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital following a psychiatric evaluation.   Azzopardi turned himself in at the Rabat police station shortly after the shooting. He is pleading not guilty to wilful homicide, using a firearm to commit a crime, firing a gun within 200 metres of an urban area and not ensuring that his gun and ammunition were kept in a secure place inside his home. During his arraignment, Azzopardi had to have questions simplified and repeated to him before providing answers, even those requesting his name and surname. Sources said his police interrogation had to be postponed by some hours before permission was obtained from the inquiring magistrate, Charmaine Galea, for him to be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist to ascertain whether he was fit for questioning. The interrogation only resumed after the green light was given. Sources close to the investigation told Times of Malta that Azzopardi had filed police reports claiming he was being followed. It is unclear what action the police took on these reports. A panel of court-appointed psychiatrists is yet to determine whether Azzopardi was in a state of mental confusion at the time of the alleged commission of the fatal crime. The defence’s request for medical records to be made available to the court indicates that the defence may plead insanity at a later stage in the criminal proceedings. Borg’s family have refuted media reports and social media rumours that he and Azzopardi were related and that there was a dispute between the pair over land. Correction January 9, 2024: A previous version stated that licences are renewed every two years. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

24/7 CCTV cameras will reduce abuse in PV: Byron Camilleri,Giulia Magri,"The planned installation of 24/7 CCTV cameras in Paceville will reduce crime and deter abuse by bouncers, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri has said.   “We had a positive experience when we introduced police body cams, we believe we will have the same effect when we have cameras 24/7 in this locality, and the abuse will be reduced,” Camilleri said on Monday. The government had announced in the Budget that it planned to place CCTV cameras across Paceville to stop crime. Similar systems were planned for parts of Marsa and Paola.  Camilleri's comments come after footage, first published by Lovin Malta showed about five bouncers savagely beating a man lying motionless on the ground in Paceville.   Since then, two bouncers, 21-year-old Riald Gragjevi and 26-year-old Ryan Zammit, were charged with injuring Ahmed Adam Idriss Albarjo.  Zammit did not have a licence to work as a security guard.  Days after, the 30-year-old Sudanese national who was filmed being kicked and beaten was also charged in connection with the New Year’s Eve incident. All have denied charges. The Home Affairs Ministry had condemned the violent attacks and said that holding a licence to work as a security guard was not a carte blanche to commit violence.  When asked about reforms to revamp the law regulating bouncers, Camilleri said there were laws regulating bouncers, and that there were frequent  “spot-checks” in Paceville to ensure that such bouncers were licensed.  “I also advise these establishments and private companies to follow these regulations, because if they do not there will be fines,” he said.  When pressed if 24/7 CCTV cameras would truly reduce crime, Camilleri said that people who knew they were being filmed thought twice before carrying out a crime.  He added that there has been a drop in bodily harm in St Julian’s last year according to the crime report with only 2020 and 2021 - when most bars were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic - registering lower rates.

Man fined after admitting he shared sex video of ex with colleagues,Edwina Brincat,"A tourist was fined €1,000 and handed a suspended sentence after admitting he sent a sex video of his ex to her colleagues without her consent. The Belgian security officer on a short stay in Malta admitted to the police during interrogation that ""it was a silly thing to do"". Morgan Hayat Smith, 25, was staying at a hotel at Msida when he shared a video of himself having sex with the victim, sending it to her co-workers and others.  He was arrested and escorted to court for allegedly sharing the footage with intent to harm the victim as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment.  ""I want to plead guilty,"" said the accused. He confirmed his admission after being granted time to consult his lawyer and reconsider.  When making submissions on punishment, prosecuting inspector Omar Zammit observed that the victim's private life had been shared without her consent.  The incident had affected the victim and was ""not to be taken lightly"". However, the accused had cooperated fully, admitted in his statement and also apologised.  He had been in Malta for three days and was expected to leave on Tuesday.  The man later admitted that ""it was a silly thing to do"" said the prosecutor, suggesting an ineffective jail term and restraining order as a punishment, given the circumstances.  Legal aid lawyer Mario Caruana agreed, noting that ""back home"", there was ""a whole saga"" between the accused and his victim. Matters ""possibly"" came to a head as a result of provocation the accused had suffered abroad, said Caruana.  ""He is now bearing the consequences of his actions,"" he said. After momentarily suspending the hearing, Magistrate Astrid May Grima delivered judgment condemning Smith to two years imprisonment suspended for four.  The court also fined the accused €1,000 and issued a three-year restraining order in favour of the victim. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Investigators clueless on motive behind New Year’s Day murder,Matthew Xuereb,"Investigators probing the New Year’s Day murder in Rabat are at a loss as to the possible motive behind the shooting and have reasons to believe that Eric Borg was shot because the suspect thought he had been following him. Police officers did not manage to extract any possible motive from suspect Noel Azzopardi during the hours of interrogation at the police headquarters. Although he answered all their questions, Azzopardi repeated several times that he was being followed. Sources close to the investigation told Times of Malta that Azzopardi had filed police reports claiming that he was being followed. It is unclear what action the police took on these reports. Azzopardi, 39, stands charged with shooting Borg, 27, twice at around 3pm in Triq il-Fidloqqom, Rabat. He has a history of psychiatric illness. He has been receiving psychiatric treatment since at least 2016 and has been under the care of a psychiatrist since then. His lawyers requested that Azzopardi’s medical records, especially those related to Mount Carmel Hospital, be presented in court. He was transferred out of the Corradino Correctional Facility to the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital following a psychiatric evaluation shortly after being accused in court of shooting Borg on New Year’s Day. Azzopardi turned himself in at the Rabat police station shortly after the shooting. He is pleading not guilty to wilful homicide, using a firearm to commit a crime, firing a gun within 200 metres of an urban area and not ensuring that his gun and ammunition were kept in a secure place inside his home. During his arraignment, Azzopardi had to have questions simplified and repeated to him before providing answers, even those requesting his name and surname. Sources said that Azzopardi’s police interrogation had to be postponed by some hours before defence lawyers obtained permission from the inquiring magistrate, Charmaine Galea, for their client to be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist to ascertain whether he was fit for questioning. The interrogation only resumed after the green light was given. The sources said Azzopardi feared he was being followed and investigators are so far relying on the thesis that he believed it was Borg who was following him. Borg’s family have denied media reports and social media rumours that he and Azzopardi were related. They also denied that there was any issue concerning land. They, however, turned down media interviews and asked for their privacy to be respected. The victim was buried on Saturday. A panel of court-appointed psychiatrists are yet to determine whether Azzopardi was in a state of mental confusion at the time of the commission of the fatal crime. The defence’s request for medical records to be made available to the court indicates that the defence may plead insanity at a later stage in the criminal proceedings. The compilation of evidence against Azzopardi will be heard by Magistrate Marseann Farrugia and is expected to begin later this month.

Daphne's killers claim money was to be collected from 'government office',Edwina Brincat,"Convicted killers Alfred and George Degiorgio have claimed that the money commissioning Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination was to be collected “from a prominent government office in Valletta”. It is their latest bid to get the authorities to act upon the information they  claim to be able to supply about the involvement of various politicians and high-profile figures, not only linked to the journalist’s murder but also other serious crimes.  In an immediate reaction to their statement, the Caruana Galizia family said that during the compilation of evidence, it was shown that Yorgen Fenech was passing on money to the Degiorgio family via self-confessed middleman Melvin Theuma.  The Degiorgio brothers are currently serving a 40-year jail term each over their involvement as hitmen in the car bomb explosion that killed Caruana Galizia metres away from her Bidnija home in October 2017.  In a statement released through their lawyers on Saturday, the two brothers claimed they had provided “important, relevant and true” information to the police about certain “hot cases” but that information was never followed up. Those cases included bombings and murders that involved politicians ""other than"" former ministers Carmelo Abela and Chris Cardona who “issued instructions for the HSBC Head Office heist.”  Both former ministers have denied the claims.  The brothers went on to say that certain members of the police corps, lawyers and also persons occupying important posts were also involved.  Focusing on the Caruana Galizia murder, the Degiorgios aimed their guns against two important players in the plot, namely, Theuma and their former co-accused, Vincent Muscat, known as il-Koħħu.  Muscat had previously been charged as the third hitman in the car bomb murder but was sentenced to a 15-year jail term after changing his plea to guilty in 2021, as part of a plea bargain deal with prosecutors where he agreed to provide information about the killing. Muscat was also granted a presidential pardon in exchange for information on the 2015 fatal shooting of lawyer Carmel Chircop.  His former partners in crime are again claiming that as far as they are concerned, Muscat “told one lie after another”. Before the three were arrested in December 2017, Muscat used to speak about the Caruana Galizia murder case with which he was personally familiar.  But his version back then “was very different to what he told police in his statements and what emerged in the media”, the brothers said. Charges against the Degiorgios were pinned upon Muscat's allegations but they could “confirm and substantiate” that he lied.   They added that il-Koħħu had spun a “colourful tale” made up of lies as far as the brothers’ involvement was concerned.  They had never received any money from Yorgen Fenech, read the statement, referring to the businessman currently awaiting trial in connection with the Caruana Galizia murder.  “We never knew this person existed until the arrests.”  Theuma too used to speak among his circle of friends about his own involvement in the journalist’s murder. The Degiorgios knew about this both from “those who gave [them] this information” and also from “high-ranking officers at the police depot”. At the time of the murder, Theuma named various persons who, for some unknown reason, were never even investigated. Theuma did not name Fenech as one of those involved in the crime by the time of the arrests and the start of compilation proceedings against the Degiorgios themselves.  Following their arrest, the brothers lost contact with Theuma. Thanks to that narrative, Theuma was granted a pardon which spared him prosecution over at least two criminal cases and also secured protection for his family, the Degiorgios said. They said Muscat was not telling the truth and his pardon was not only unjustified but ought to be withdrawn.  As for Theuma, he had never named Fenech to the Degiorgios but had always spoken about “a prominent government official who had an office in Valletta.” And the funds for the murder were to be collected from sources “at a prominent government office in Valletta, as Theuma himself always told us,” stated the Degiorgios, expressing hope that the authorities would “send for them as soon as possible.” “We’ve shouldered [our responsibility.] Now others must do likewise.”  The Degiorgios were assisted by lawyers Noel Bianco and Leslie Cuschieri in releasing their statement. In a reaction on Saturday, the Caruana Galizia family said: ""Yorgen Fenech asked for a presidential pardon for Daphne's murder. An innocent man does not ask to be pardoned for murder. ""During the compilation of evidence, it was shown that Yorgen Fenech was passing on money to the Degiorgio family via self-confessed middleman, Melvin Theuma. Theuma testified under oath that he never mentioned Fenech’s name to the Degiorgios.”               You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Editorial: Making digital banking safe,Times of Malta,"Digital banking (online and mobile banking) makes managing finances easy. We live in an increasingly online world where, thanks to digital banking technology, we can pay bills, deposit cheques and transfer money from wherever we are located. Sadly, in the last several years, there has been a surge in attacks by cyber criminals who target banks’ systems to steal data and money from customers. The Financial Services Arbiter recently decided on two complaints made by Bank of Valletta customers who argue that the bank contributed to their being scammed by cybercriminals through its negligence. Through his decisions, the arbiter introduced an essential principle that apportions negligence on the part of banks and their clients in cybercrimes. One of the core ways criminals target banks is through their customers. They prey on the naivety and ignorance of those who do not understand the dangers in the digital space and who they can trick into disclosing important information. A BOV spokesperson argued with the arbiter that the bank “was fully compliant with the law and that the complainant was entirely to blame for being defrauded due to gross negligence”. Banks have deep pockets and can resort to legal tactics to limit their liability to the bare minimum when they fail to protect clients’ assets adequately. Still, the duty of care towards customers is a fundamental principle when professionals deal with ordinary people who may not always understand the complexities of modern technology. The arbiter correctly decided that banks must do more to observe their duty of care to their customers effectively. In today’s society it isn’t easy to imagine functioning without smartphones, computers and internet communication. Our whole lives are thus contained in devices that fit in the palms of our hands. Thousands of bank customers receive ‘spoof’ e-mails and SMSs impersonating a bank’s website using a website similar to the original. It is no longer a question of merely preventing cyberattacks. This has become nearly impossible. It is about being prepared for a cyberattack and having a response already planned out. Banks must continuously deploy new cybersecurity defences to counteract the ever-evolving world of cybercrime. Bank customers must know what cyberattacks look like to prevent these scams from proving successful. This is why investment in educating people must be more intensive. This includes teaching customers about the dangers of revealing their credentials and how to respond if they suspect an attempted fraud is taking place. Acting quickly is crucial to preventing damage. But contacting the bank urgently is next to impossible as online help desk facilities are often inadequate to get a quick response and guidance from bank staff. Banks must invest more in efficient online customer support to assist people who need help in an emergency. Today, many banks team up with third-party fintech companies because they believe they help them serve their customers more efficiently. However, banks can suffer badly if they partner with third-party vendors with poor cybersecurity. Banks must, therefore, select ITC partners with extreme care and caution if they want to avoid the consequences of reputational risk. Protecting clients’ assets is the most fundamental purpose of cybersecurity in digital banking, especially in our increasingly cashless society, where more payments and transactions happen online. Ultimately, the banks’ duty of care to their customers must be the topmost priority. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

New Year’s Day murder suspect transferred to Forensic Unit,Matthew Xuereb,"The man accused of murdering Eric Borg on New Year’s Day was transferred out of the Kordin prisons to the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital following a psychiatric evaluation, according to sources. Noel Azzopardi was examined by professionals following his arraignment and the decision was taken to transfer him to the psychiatric hospital in Attard, sources close to the investigation told Times of Malta. He spent some time under constant watch but the order was then repealed. Borg, 27, was shot twice on Monday afternoon and died on the pavement at Triq il-Fidloqqom, Rabat. Azzopardi, 39, who is unemployed, turned himself in at the Rabat police station shortly after the shooting. He was arraigned on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to wilful homicide, using a firearm to commit a crime, firing a gun within 200 metres of an urban area and not ensuring that his gun and ammunition were kept in a secure place inside his home. His lawyers told the court that their client had a history of psychiatric treatment and they requested that Azzopardi’s medical records, especially those related to Mount Carmel Hospital, be presented in court. Sources said Azzopardi has been receiving psychiatric treatment since 2016 and has been under the care of a psychiatrist since. Azzopardi needed to have questions simplified and repeated to him before providing answers. Sources said Azzopardi has been speaking to fellow inmates about his case, saying: “What have I done? What have I got myself into?” Borg will be laid to rest on Saturday at 9am at St Paul’s Basilica, in Rabat, after his corpse was released for burial by inquiring magistrate Charmaine Galea.

"Tourists 'dine and dash' after eating at popular Siġġiewi restaurant, owners say",Giulia Magri,"Seven tourists dined and dashed at a popular Siġġiewi restaurant leaving an unpaid €135 bill, the owners claim. In a Facebook post on Friday, the owners of Marilù’s posted stills of CCTV footage showing the seven diners who they say left without settling their bill. “They don’t realise that it really affects a small home-run business like ours,"" the owners wrote. “Just a heads up to other restaurants and bars, this group of 7 French-speaking tourists had a nice lunch followed by coffee at ours and then left in twos discreetly while our servers were busy tending to other tables and the bar.""   The owner of Marilù's told Times of Malta that the large group arrived at the restaurant and said they were in a ""rush"" to be served. ""We made sure that their dishes were served quickly, and we even served them coffee,"" she said. ""Then they began to leave slowly, first two people went downstairs and outside, and then another person went to the bar to ask for the coffee to be put in a take-away cup and then walked outside. We were very busy and didn't notice they all left, this never happened to us before."" She said the group left their €135 bill left unsettled. She reported the group to the police but was informed it might be difficult to trace them, as they might have been on their way to the airport. It is the second incident involving the establishment in a year. Last January, CCTV footage filmed a pick-up truck driving and smashing into stone planters outside the restaurant.   The next day, the driver and passengers owned up and replaced the planters they destroyed. A similar dine-and-dash incident happened earlier last year when five youths ordered a full meal and coffee at the Msida restaurant Pasta and Co and ran away without paying. Yet, the father of one of the youths involved apologised, settled the unpaid bill by donating €250 to charity and even offered to send his son to work at the restaurant for free.

Suspected mugger arrested after victim saw him walking past police station,Edwina Brincat,"A suspected mugger was arrested on Thursday after his alleged victim saw him walking past the police station shortly after filing a report. Hamza Mohamud Ibrahim, a 29-year-old Somali national who is homeless and jobless, was escorted to court on Friday afternoon as the suspect behind the mugging which took place at around 9.30 pm yesterday. The victim turned up at the Marsa police station at around 10 pm on Thursday claiming that he had been walking along Triq Dicembru 13 when someone grabbed him by the shoulder, attacked him and stole his Samsung mobile phone.  The man also gave a physical description of his male aggressor, including his clothes and later supplied a medical certificate which classified his injuries as slight.  But just as the alleged victim stepped outside the police station, he spotted the suspect and headed back inside to alert the officers.  Two policemen approached the suspect who put up a struggle and violently resisted arrest. During the arrest, one of the officers’ smartwatches was damaged and the policeman’s hand was injured.  The suspect was finally restrained and searched.   Five sachets of a greenish substance, later certified as a synthetic drug, were found in his possession, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa when giving an overview of the events leading up to the arrest.  The suspect was hospitalised and charged following his discharge earlier on Friday.  Under interrogation, Ibrahim could only recall “some mobile” but no further details of the incident.  He did, however, say that he was addicted to the synthetic drug.  Assisted by two interpreters, the accused pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft, slightly injuring his victim, violently resisting arrest, wilful damage to third party property, unlawful possession of drugs as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.  His legal aid lawyer, Martina Herrera, did not request bail.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Gatt, upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the victim and remanded the accused in custody.

"Pistorius released from prison on parole, 11 years after shooting partner dead",AFP,"South Africa's ex-Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was released from jail on parole Friday and ""is now at home"", authorities said, almost 11 years after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in a crime that gripped the world. Having served more than half his sentence, the 37-year-old double-amputee was quietly whisked out from the Atteridgeville prison on the outskirts of the capital Pretoria, avoiding the hordes of media gathered outside. ""He was admitted into the system of Community Corrections and is now at home,"" the Department of Correctional Services said in a statement. Pistorius, known worldwide as ""Blade Runner"" for his carbon-fibre prosthetics, will not be allowed to speak to the media as a condition of his parole. Prison authorities had previously warned the press that there would be no opportunity to photograph or speak to him.  Pistorius killed Steenkamp, a model who was 29 years old at the time, in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house. The shooting came a year after Pistorius made history by being the first double-amputee to race at Olympic level when he appeared at the London 2012 games. He was found guilty of murder and given a 13-year jail sentence in 2017 after a lengthy trial and several appeals. He had pleaded not guilty and denied killing Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar. The morning ahead of his release, Steenkamp's mother June issued a statement saying that while she accepted the decision of the justice system and conditions of his parole, ""the pain is still raw and real"".  ""There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back,"" she said.  ""We, who remain behind, are the ones serving a life sentence."" Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half their sentence. Pistorius lost a first bid in March when the board found he had not completed the minimum detention period required to be let out. The Constitutional Court in October ruled that was a mistake, paving the way for a November hearing that approved his release. As part of his parole, until the end of his sentence in 2029, Pistorius must undergo therapy for anger and gender-based violence issues. He will also be banned from consuming alcohol and other substances, required to complete community service and also be home at certain hours of the day.  The conditions ""send out a clear message that gender-based violence is taken seriously"" by the country's justice system, June Steenkamp said Friday.

Home Affairs Ministry condemns violent Paceville attack,Jessica Arena,"The Home Affairs Ministry has condemned the violent attack filmed in Paceville earlier this week, saying that having a licence to work as a security guard is not a carte blanche to commit violence. A spokesperson for the ministry was replying to questions sent by Times of Malta, shortly after news of the attack went public, about reform the government had promised after a similar attack in 2019. On Tuesday, footage first published by Lovin Malta showed around five bouncers savagely beating a man lying motionless on the ground, cradling his head as he was kicked repeatedly and hit with what appeared to be a retractable baton. In 2019, after CCTV video captured an unlicensed bouncer kicking a man in the head, Michael Farrugia, who was home affairs minister at the time, had said that the government was in talks to revamp the law regulating bouncers. This came amid complaints that employers were finding it difficult to hire licensed bouncers at the time.   Asked whether plans for the reform were still in the pipeline after the incident, the spokesperson said that violence on the streets was not a matter up for reform but a matter of “basics”. “Having a security licence does not give you a licence to commit acts of violence. The appalling act of violence that happened in Paceville is not a question of reform but a question of basics, violence is simply not on,” the spokesperson said.  RELATED STORIES  He added that, in recent years, the Malta Police Force has allocated more resources to operate “intelligence-led policing” in Paceville. This has resulted in a “significant drop” in bodily-harm crime in St Julian’s, which registered its third-lowest crime rate in 25 years, according to the last annual crime report. Lower rates of bodily-harm crime were only registered in 2020 and 2021, during which COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were in place. The government is always open to more reform and investment, the spokesperson added, with more projects in the pipeline to improve security in Paceville. As announced in the budget plans for 2024, LESA will be investing in a technology project that includes cameras connected to both the agency’s control room as well as the police headquarters to serve as a deterrent against crime.

"Today's front pages – January 5, 2023",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Friday. Times of Malta and L-orizzont lead with news that a 21-year-old bouncer has denied seriously injuring a man outside a Paceville nightclub on New Year's Eve and claims he was the victim after being stabbed with a broken bottle. Times of Malta also reports that supermarket owners and importers are facing government pressure to reduce the recommended prices of a range of staple grocery products by up to 15 per cent starting this month, as inflation continues to bite.   The Malta Independent, L-orizzont and In-Nazzjon separately report that the government will be asking the court to allow it to intervene in a case filed by the Opposition against the State Advocate over alleged inaction in recovering funds from the hospitals' deal. In another frontpage article, The Malta Independent reports that BOV is refusing to divulge information about the developer that will be turning the bank's Attard branch into apartments.

The three murder cases that turned New Year's Day into tragedy,Giulia Magri,"When Eric Borg was shot dead outside his hometown in Rabat on Monday, it was just over thirteen hours into the New Year. The killing of the 27-year-old taxi driver marked the third time in 224 years a murder has been perpetrated on New Year's Day.  And according to crime historian Eddie Attard, it is unusual for murders to be carried out in the first month of the year.  “January has the least number of murders, with 28 documented since 1800,” Attard told Times of Malta.   The murder on Monday has revived memories of a double tragedy that took place 12 years ago on New Year's Day. Malta entered the New Year in 2012 with the news that Duncan Zammit, 32, and Nicholas Gera, 26, had died of multiple stab wounds in Zammit’s apartment. At the time, the police were unaware of the motives and had not established any links between the Zammit family and Gera, who entered the home in the early hours of the first day of the year. It was witnessed by Zammit's wife, Claire while their three-month-old twins were sleeping in another room. She called her father, entrepreneur Angelo Xuereb, and the emergency services following the accident. In a magazine interview, she recounted the shock of waking up and seeing her husband “fighting for his life”. The motive remains a mystery and, 12 years on, the case is still unresolved.   The first reported homicide to take place on New Year’s Day in Malta happened in 1879 when Vincenzo Cucciardi's body was found in his home in Cospicua. Following days of investigations which led to nothing, the authorities guaranteed impunity from prosecution to any accomplice who would reveal the identity of the killer and the circumstances surrounding the murder. It also offered a prize of 100 scudi (around €1,900) for information. A man called Ċikku Attard told the police that he had information about two crimes. He claimed Wenzu Bonanno was the mastermind behind the murder and he had managed to lure a certain Toni Ellul, the victim’s son-in-law, to join him in the crime. Around midnight, two other men, Wiġi Darmanin and Ċikku Farrugia, went to Cucciardi's house to rob him. At the time of the robbery, Ellul was also there. After stealing various silverware and valuables, Cucciardi was stabbed to death. During the robbery, Attard stayed close to the door and later on told the police that he had fled the scene of the crime. While Attard was given a pardon for providing information on the accomplices, the police could not find Ellul as he had fled Malta. Apart from this murder, Attard also provided the police with information about another murder that took place on December 29, 1879, when Francesca Bellia was murdered by Farrugia and Bonnano. A year later, on January 21, 1830, a trial against Darmanin, Farrugia, Bonanno and his wife, Maddalena Bonnano began and all were charged with theft and murder. All three men were given the death penalty and were executed in Floriana on February 3, 1830. Maddalena Bonanno was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. January 21, 1837 Rożi Ciangura was thrown into a well in Mtaħleb, limits of Rabat by her husband, Feliċ Ciangura. Her death is the first homicide reported in Malta since 1800. Feliċ managed to flee Malta and, after 19 years, returned. He was later charged with his wife’s murder and consequently sentenced to life imprisonment. January 2, 1893 George Godwin, an English sailor, was murdered by 24-year-old Ġużeppi Vella during a dispute behind a prostitute’s door in St Anne's Street in Valletta. Vella tried to skip the queue, insisting that he should go first. An argument broke out between the two men and Godwin was strangled to death. January 2, 2022   Paulina Dembska’s body was found at the Independence Gardens in Sliema. The 29-year-old Polish student was raped and murdered in the early morning. Abner Aquilina was charged with murder and the case is still ongoing. Officers previously testified that Aquilina told them “the devil” made him kill the Polish student and a court heard that his confession was recorded on a police bodycam. The murder horrified the nation and, following countless protests and mounting pressure by women’s rights groups, Malta introduced the concept of femicide in the criminal code in June 2022. January 18, 2023   Just one hour into her 30th birthday, Pelin Kaya was walking home from a small birthday celebration when she was killed after a car ran her over. Kaya, originally from Istanbul, was an interior designer who lived in Gżira, not far from the crash site, and had been living in Malta for over a year. Jeremie Camilleri was charged with murder and the case is still ongoing. He pleaded not guilty to wilful homicide and causing property damage.

IS jihadists claim Iran suicide bombings that killed 84,AFP,"Updated 6.15pm The Islamic State jihadist group said Thursday that it carried out twin bombings that killed at least 84 people at a memorial ceremony in Iran for slain Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani. The claim from IS came as Iran observed a day of national mourning for those killed in Wednesday's blasts. In a statement on Telegram, IS said two of its members ""activated their explosives vests"" among the crowds who had come to honour Soleimani on the anniversary of his death in a targeted US drone strike in Baghdad four years ago.  RELATED STORIES  Iranian investigators had already confirmed that the first blast at least was the work of a ""suicide bomber"" and believed the trigger for the second was ""very probably another suicide bomber"", the official IRNA news agency reported earlier, citing an ""informed source"". Soleimani, who headed the Guards' foreign operations arm the Quds Force, was a staunch enemy of IS, a Sunni extremist group which has carried out previous attacks in majority-Shiite Iran. The death toll was revised down from around 100 the day after what Iranian authorities labelled a ""terrorist attack"" that also wounded hundreds near Soleimani's tomb in the southern city of Kerman.  Iran has suffered deadly attacks in the past from jihadists and other militants as well as targeted killings of officials and nuclear scientists blamed on arch-foe Israel. On Thursday, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi spoke to ISNA news agency about bolstering security over its porous borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.  He said authorities have identified ""priority points to block along the border"" with the two countries, which has long been a key access point for militant groups, drug smugglers and irregular migrants.  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday blamed ""evil and criminal enemies"" of the Islamic republic, without naming them, and vowed a ""harsh response"". Regional tensions have surged amid the Gaza war sparked when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched their deadly October 7 attack on Israel, which Tehran welcomed while denying any involvement. President Ebrahim Raisi's deputy chief of staff for political affairs, Mohammad Jamshidi, charged on social media platform X that ""the responsibility for this crime lies with the US and Zionist (Israeli) regimes, and terrorism is just a tool"". The United States rejected any suggestion that it or its ally Israel were behind the bombings, while Israel declined to comment. ""The United States was not involved in any way, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous,"" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.  ""We have no reason to believe that Israel was involved in this explosion,"" he added, expressing sympathies to the victims of the ""horrific"" explosions and their families. Regional tensions have surged since the Gaza war erupted, drawing in Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Hamas fighters infiltrated Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.  In response, Israel launched a relentless offensive that has reduced vast swathes of Gaza to rubble and killed more than 22,300 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. Iranian authorities called for mass protests against the Kerman blasts after weekly prayers on Friday, when officials said those killed would be laid to rest. Revising the death toll, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told IRNA ""The number of martyrs... has been announced as 84 so far."" Iran's emergency services chief Jafar Miadfar pointed to difficulties identifying dismembered bodies and said some victims were mistakenly counted ""several times"". He said 284 people were wounded and ""195 are still hospitalised"". Revered by many Iranians, Soleimani oversaw Iranian military operations across the Middle East, and millions came to his funeral in 2020. Current Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani suggested the Kerman crowd was ""attacked by bloodthirsty people supplied by the United States and the Zionist regime"".  He pointed to two recent killings widely blamed on Israel -- a Beirut strike on Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri, and the killing near Damascus of senior Guards commander Razi Moussavi in December. ""The killing of Aruri and people like Razi Moussavi and the crime in Kerman show how desperate the enemy is,"" Qaani said. Iran regularly accuses its arch-foes Israel and the United States of inciting unrest, and authorities last month executed five people convicted of collaborating with Israel. In July, Iran's intelligence ministry said it had disbanded a network ""linked to Israel's spy organisation"" that it said had been plotting ""terrorist operations"" across Iran. In September, the Fars news agency reported that an IS-affiliated key ""operative"", in charge of carrying out ""terrorist operations"", had been arrested in Kerman.

'Multiple gunshot victims' in Iowa school shooting: sheriff,AFP,"Updated 6.20pm A shooting on Thursday at a high school in the midwestern US state of Iowa left ""multiple gunshot victims,"" local authorities said, adding the incident was over but without confirming if anyone had been killed. The shooting at around 7.30am (1330 GMT) triggered a major police response as emergency vehicles and armed units rushed to the Perry High School, where classes had not yet started for the day. ""We are still unclear exactly how many are injured or what the extent of those are, but we are working on that right now. There is no further danger to the public,"" Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante told reporters gathered at the school. Broadcaster NBC reported that the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, citing multiple law enforcement officials. ""An officer first arrived within seven minutes of (a radio) activation and located multiple gunshot victims,"" Infante said. He said that there were ""very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome, in that sense."" He added that the authorities had identified the shooter, but didn't give any further details, including on any arrest or deaths. ""The community is safe. We're just now working backwards, trying to figure out everything that happened,"" Infante said. CNN reported that Thursday was scheduled to be the first day of classes for the new semester, according to the school district's calendar. Perry is about 55 kilometres from the state capital, Des Moines. Gun violence is common in the United States, a country where there are more firearms than people, and where attempts to clamp down on their spread are always met with stiff political resistance. The country has already recorded three mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nongovernmental organization that defines a mass shooting as four or more people wounded or killed. Last year ended with a total of 656 such shootings. School shootings in particular have become a totemic reminder of the country's political deadlock. In May 2022, a man killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. The Perry shooting comes less than two weeks before the Iowa caucus, the country's first contest kicking off the primary season for the 2024 presidential election. Guns are likely to once again be a hot topic of debate this election cycle, though with little legislative action expected.

"Bouncer denies Paceville beating charges, claims he was a victim too",Jessica Arena,"Updated 12.56pm A 21-year-old bouncer has denied seriously injuring a man outside a Paceville nightclub on New Year's Eve and claims he was the victim after being stabbed with a broken bottle. Riald Gragjevi appeared in court on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to causing grievous injuries by using improper arms against Idriss Ahmed Adem in an assault that was caught on camera. Gragjevi, an Albanian national who lives in St Paul's Bay, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon as he attempted to board a flight out of the country. Police officials at the airport recognised that the man was connected to the Paceville beating and he was arrested by officers from the Rapid Intervention Unit.    Inspector Brian Xuereb told the court that he had been working the night shift between December 31 and January 1 when he responded to a report that a person was unconscious in St George’s Road in Paceville. When Xuereb arrived on the scene, an ambulance was called for the victim - Sudanese student Ahmed Adem - and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was found to have been suffering from grievous bodily harm.   Xuereb added that earlier in the evening a security guard had filed a police report saying that he had been assaulted and injured with a broken bottle, and it was determined that the report had been made about the victim. Gragjevi was arrested when police were alerted that he was trying to board a flight out of Malta and leave the country. The police inspector said Ahmed Adem is also wanted by police and is being investigated in connection to the security guard's injuries.    Defence lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi told Magistrate Joe Mifsud that while they would not be asking for bail at the time being, his client maintained his innocence and that he had been a victim himself. ""My client was stabbed by a broken bottle and suffered an injury that required eight stitches in the shoulder,"" he said, adding that two other bottles were thrown at him after the stabbing.  Ghaznavi said his client was not trying to abscond from Malta and that his plane ticket had been bought three weeks before the incident. The lawyer, assisted by lawyers Charlton Gouder and Jessica Formosa, urged the prosecution to bring civilian witnesses to court as quickly as possible so that a case for bail could be made.  Footage of the brutal attack, first published by Lovin Malta, showed around five bouncers kicking and hitting a man lying motionless on the floor as horrified onlookers watched.  The victim also published a video showing that he had tried to get the police to intervene with an issue he was having with the club bouncers prior to the beating.    Asked by the court who he worked for, Gragjevi said he worked in security.  Kerber Es Ltd, the company responsible for some of the bouncers involved in the incident, has declined to comment due to ongoing police investigations.

UN top court to hear genocide case against Israel next week,AFP,"The UN's top court will hear submissions next week from South Africa and Israel after Pretoria opened a case for what it called Israel's ""genocidal"" acts in Gaza. South Africa wants to International Court of Justice to urgently order Israel to suspend its military operations in Gaza, in a case which Israel rejected ""with disgust."" The ICJ ""will hold public hearings at the Peace Palace in The Hague... in proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel,"" on Thursday 11 and Friday 12 January, the court said in a statement. The South African application, filed last Friday, related to alleged violations by Israel of its obligations under the Genocide Convention, saying that ""Israel has engaged in, is engaging in and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza."" Israel rejected the charge, with Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat writing on X, formerly Twitter: ""Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application"" to the ICJ. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added Israel displayed ""unparalleled morality"" in the Gaza war as he too dismissed South Africa's charge. South Africa, amongst other urgent measures, is asking the court to order that ""Israel shall immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"" and that both countries ""take all reasonable measures within their power to prevent genocide."" Israel launched a relentless military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian militants carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7. The militants' attack left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's ongoing Gaza offensive has killed more than 22,300 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. South Africa will present its arguments on Thursday of next week, while Israel is set to counter on Friday. A ruling by the ICJ on the request for emergency measures is expected to follow within weeks, but the case proper could still take months or even years. Set up after World War II, the ICJ is the UN's highest legal body and rules in disputes between countries. Decisions are legally binding, but the court has little power to enforce them.

"Suspect in Rabat murder confessed to officers wearing bodycams, sources say",Mark Laurence Zammit,"The prime suspect in the New Year’s Day murder of Eric Borg confessed to police officers as he was being arrested, sources told Times of Malta on Tuesday. Noel Azzopardi, 39, is expected to be arraigned and charged with Borg’s death. He gave himself up to police in Rabat on Monday afternoon, as officers began a manhunt following the Triq il-Fidloqqom shooting.  Borg, a 27-year-old cab driver, was found bleeding on a pavement in the street close to his home. He had been shot twice using a shotgun. Emergency responders pronounced him dead at the scene.  Sources told Times of Malta that Azzopardi walked into the Rabat police station and gave himself up. His confession was captured on the officers’ bodycams. The two men had reportedly argued in the hours preceding the shooting.  Under Maltese law, the police have 48 hours to arraign a criminal suspect from the moment of arrest, meaning they must charge Azzopardi in court by Wednesday afternoon.  Sources told Times of Malta that he is being represented by lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri and Alex Miruzzi .  Magistrate Charmaine Galea is leading an inquiry.

Times of Malta journalists reveal the story behind the story,Times of Malta,"Every year we ask Times of Malta journalists to share the story they worked on in the last 12 months that left an impact on them and why. Here are their choices for 2023.    Documentary evidence is the gold standard for any article. I realised I had hit such a goldmine as soon as I started delving into thousands of WhatsApp messages exchanged between a Transport Malta employee and top government officials. The chats made me angry. They detailed how ex-Transport Minister Ian Borg, ministry officials and even the prime minister’s assistant “helped” Labour-leaning voters get an easy ride during their driving tests. There was apparently little regard to the dangers of short-circuiting a system designed to keep potentially unsafe drivers off the road.  Prime Minister Robert Abela even had the gall to dismiss the practice of “helping” voters in such a manner as a normal part of Malta’s political system. Employers slammed Abela’s suggestion as an “invitation to anarchy”. Insurers urged the authorities to force all those who benefitted from the racket to retake their driving test. Doctors echoed their demand. The Opposition called the government endorsed system a “licence to kill”. The police were conspicuously silent. There was not much they could say, having sat on the same evidence I had obtained for over a year. To date, only three Transport Malta officials have been charged with trading in influence.   Top government officials who passed on the names of candidates to the Transport Malta employees have escaped any consequences. These include Borg, the prime minister’ assistant Rachel Debono, the Gozo Minister’s chief of staff Michael Buhagiar and former OPM official Ray Mizzi, who now works as a customer care official in minister Michael Falzon’s secretariat. The invitation to anarchy continues.   “I don’t have any photos of my son,” Christine sighed sadly on the other end of the line. “They took everything”. Christine was describing how scammers locked her out of her Facebook, Instagram and Google accounts, where she meticulously documented her son’s childhood through photos, and convinced her to record a blackmail-style video in the desperate hope of getting them back. Christine was just one of countless victims of a crypto investment scam that spread like wildfire over the summer. Some lost money, others lost access to their social media accounts, often having to rebuild their business accounts from scratch. Shockingly, some even had to watch in horror as a deepfake likeness of themselves promoting the scam was shared online. I spoke to several people who fell victim to the scam. Many of them were cagey, either embarrassed at having been scammed in the first place or angry that a stranger was asking them to relive the experience. Christine was guarded. Once bitten, twice shy.   “How do I know you are who you say you are?”, was the first thing she asked. A fair question, given the circumstances. Several reassuring emails and messages later, with my identity finally verified, Christine opened up, showing me copies of the long chats between herself and the scammers. The chats were shocking, the scammers moving seamlessly from false empathy and concern one minute, to cruel taunts and threats the next. Meanwhile, there was Christine, desperately trying every trick in the book to get her accounts back, pleading with the scammers, threatening to involve the police and, eventually, giving up. News about scams often goes under the radar. “That would never happen to me”, we sneer whenever we come across stories of scam victims, “I’d never fall for that”. Perhaps we won’t. But, as scams become more sophisticated and harder to detect by the day, we all have something to learn from Christine’s story.   It’s 6.30am on January 18. Still half-asleep, I reach out for my mobile and start my usual routine of scrolling through social media to see if anything happened during the night. That’s when I saw a post about a woman being killed after a car ran her over. The details were scarce, but looking at the photo I realised that this had happened next to a KFC restaurant that was less than a five-minute walk from my home. The dawn sky was still a faint purple colour when I arrived there. It was a disaster. Glass shards, broken rubble, and metal were scattered all around. A handful of police officers and bystanders crowded around the black BMW that had run over Pelin Kaya and crashed into the restaurant window.  Shortly after publishing the story, sources and neighbours of the BMW driver, Jeremie Camilleri, reached out to me with information about him. I recall one of Kaya’s colleagues telling me, over the phone, that she was the pedestrian victim killed just one hour into her 30th birthday as she was walking home from a small birthday celebration at the time. As the week progressed, Pelin Kaya’s murder and her story continued to make headlines. When I watched Kaya’s family lay her birthday cake  at the site of her death, the true weight of what had happened hit me. The cake was covered in references to the 1990s sitcom Friends, including the lettering ‘the one where Pelin turns 30’ and the unnerving phrase “why God, why”.   Her sister, Derya, was on her knees, weeping as she sang Happy Birthday over her sister's cake. I cannot describe the emotions that overcame me at that moment. With the help of two Turkish journalists I had the opportunity to sit down with Pelin’s mother, Çiçek, who recalled how she could hear her daughter’s voice when she visited the site of her murder. The cake is long gone and the flowers placed during that vigil have been replaced many times. Every time I walk past that area, I think of Pelin Kaya and hope her family will get some form of justice soon.   Christmas is a time when the best of humanity is on show. People look to spend time with their loved ones and donate to charitable causes. When I stumbled on a story about workers at a Christmas Village going unpaid, I couldn't help but think of the irony. JK Security Services Limited provided labour to the 2021 Ta’ Xbiex Christmas Village and promised their workers between €6 and €7 an hour. But nine foreign nationals employed by the subcontracting company were left unpaid for hundreds of hours' worth of work. ""I didn't even get a single euro to survive, eat food or pay rent,"" one of them told me. The workers only had a verbal agreement with the company, leaving them with nowhere to turn.   ""We were not working legally, so what could we do? If I went to the authorities, I could have been deported,"" one said. After we published the story, the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations said they were investigating the issue. Many non-EU nationals are often unaware of Maltese laws, afraid to report abuse to authorities, and willing to accept illegal working conditions to survive. I’ve spent much of 2023 writing about the exploitation of non-EU nationals and trying to expose the shifty employers who look to capitalise on their vulnerability.  Unfortunately, the abuse of workers appears to be for life, not just for Christmas.   “He was the centre of my life,” Isabelle Bonnici cried at the opening session of the public inquiry into the tragic death of her 20-year-old son Jean Paul. Her cry was echoed by John Sofia in the final stages of the inquiry: “My world has ended,” the victim’s father said, his voice cracking as he wrapped up his testimony. All those following proceedings were left momentarily speechless. Jean Paul Sofia was buried alive under the rubble of a Corradino factory that came crashing down like a stack of dominoes. It was another construction tragedy that shocked the nation. Memories of court proceedings related to the tragic death of Miriam Pace – another civilian buried alive – were still fresh in my mind when I found myself sitting through 15 sessions of the Sofia public inquiry, starting in mid-August. Through it all, I observed Jean Paul’s parents, united in grief but steadfast in their resolve to get answers about their son’s death, no matter how uncomfortable.   Their determination to kickstart a public inquiry, casting a spotlight on the construction industry, was an admirable feat. Taking the witness stand, must not have been easy. But Isabelle and John overcame any qualms and testified not only for the sake of their son but also to ensure that others would not go through a similar experience. They battled the darkness that came down on them as they watched their son’s lifeless body being pulled out of the rubble, setting out on a quest for justice which brought hope that long-needed changes in the construction sector might finally materialise.   2023 seems to have been characterised by stories of local communities struggling with disruption and chaos in their localities. Once-tranquil residential areas have been facing the frustration of unruly construction, traffic, hygiene issues, noise pollution and out-of-place activity as they are commercialised, and in the case of The Strand in Sliema, transformed into a pumping nightlife mecca. When I agreed to meet the inhabitants of this supposedly upmarket, seaview-apartment area, I saw a route I had often hurriedly taken in a completely different light. As I walked through a dark, narrow tunnel to the beat of loud music, sandwiched tight between bars and restaurants and their extended outdoor seating areas, I could see how these had replaced much-needed parking spaces, while double and triple parking created obstacles on the busy main road. They were also a hazard for residents in case of an emergency, with access, both along the pavement and into their homes, being hindered by the unbridled occupation of public land. The group of residents were vociferous about their distress in the face of rising fumes from illegal eateries beneath, the wild behaviour of drunk and rowdy revellers, as well as the drowning out the relaxing sounds of the sea and all the reasons why they invested in these properties.   Trapped in their apartments, unable to use their terraces due to the din, stench and dangers from the chaos below, their protest was eventually met with a promise of enforcement action. Months later, however, I still receive a barrage of e-mails from the residents on a wild-goose chase of a spate of authorities, highlighting the problems in the “lawless” entertainment hub. I duly file these in a separate and ever-growing folder, as, together with other illegalities I have highlighted in the area, they continue to fester.   People often expect us journalists to identify the good people from the bad people. They expect us to compartmentalise heroes and villains to make sense of this very complicated life. The more I work in this profession, the more I realise real-life people are rarely heroes or villains. The disability benefits racket stood out to me as one of the boldest examples of that reality. It wasn’t immediately clear to my colleague Jacob Borg and myself how big the racket was, until we began to untangle it and saw its magnitude unravel before us. Hundreds of people had defrauded taxpayers thousands of euros each, silently and comfortably pocketing an extra income every month without anyone ever batting an eyelid for years before the police got wind of it. ‘These are some bad people,’ you’d think to yourself in the face of overwhelming evidence. It turned out most of them were also very sick and poor. People often tell me, ‘Does that justify what they did?’ Of course not, but it humbles us into understanding that the issues are far more complex.   In all fairness, some cheats were neither poor nor sick. They walked into the racket knowing very well what they were doing. But these people were also led to believe the powers that be were on their side, only to realise – when they found themselves before the police – that their own party and people were nowhere to be seen. And that’s one other thing that really impacted me this year. Seeing these people thrown under the bus, seeing Jean Paul Sofia repeatedly shunned by the government he voted for... It got me thinking. When you get into trouble and you think you have too many friends to rely on, no matter who you are, you’ll most likely be alone.   Journalism can often feel frustrating, with the wheels of change moving slowly at best or all too often, remaining stationary. But not always. In May, Times of Malta received a tip-off about an apartment in Sliema housing large numbers of workers. I went to take a look. The situation that greeted me was alarming; around 40 foreign workers were paying up to €250 a month each, sleeping up to nine in a room with only three bathrooms and one kitchen between themselves. Towels tied to bunk bed railings provided only limited privacy, while food packets, suitcases, clothes and pots and pans littered the floor. Some beds were just mattresses on the floor. The conditions were cramped, unsanitary and unacceptable. We have a word for that: slum. Just as shocking were the stories of the tenants. They wanted to leave but said they couldn’t because “most people don’t rent to an Indian or someone from Bangladesh”. And with many of them working in the lowest-paid jobs, such as food couriers, their options were limited. Meanwhile, their landlord – who we estimated could have been raking in around €8,000 per month in rent – seemed to be living it up, his profile photo on Facebook showing him enjoying a day out on a speedboat.   Readers were understandably shocked at the conditions inside the apartment. Within hours of the story being published, police accompanied by officials from the health and housing departments swooped on the property. I waited for changes to the law that would ensure such situations couldn’t re-occur. But nothing happened. Then in December, proposed amendments to rent laws were announced. The changes mean landlords will no longer be able to register rental properties with more than six tenants who are not part of the same family. While the problem will likely not disappear overnight, it is both heartening and encouraging to see that change can and sometimes does happen.   Workplace accidents and injuries have become so commonplace that we are almost desensitised to any injury short of death reported. One such person was Mekhi, a 22-year-old Sudanese man who lost his leg after he fell into a cement mixer. Although Mekhi’s story grabbed people’s attention at the time it was reported, most of us did not think much about what became of the young man after his ordeal. That changed for me when, through the work of the YMCA, Mekhi went public with his story and revealed that he had ended up homeless as a direct result of the incident. He was kept in an induced coma for three weeks and awoke to find his left leg amputated and his right severely mangled. As he started his journey of recovery, Mekhi’s roommate decided to leave the country. Unable to pay rent on his own, Mekhi ended up evicted and forced to sleep on the streets. He even contemplated suicide before he was able to find help. Once is a tragedy, but multiple is a pattern of behaviour. At the start of January 2023, there were 87 pending magisterial inquiries into workplace deaths and injuries.   Foreign workers tell us how they come to this country seeking better prospects in industries that are constantly asking for more personnel. Despite this, they end up exploited, forced to subsist on meagre wages and live in sub-optimal housing. And finally, as Mekhi’s story illustrates, when they are injured on the job and are no longer of value to their employers, they are discarded. The contrast between how we perceive ourselves as welcoming and charitable versus how we treat those we perceive as strangers must be reckoned with. There is no us and them when it comes to basic human decency.   Three years ago, Agnes Mudembo told me about her horrific ordeal in Malta. Agnes was flown over as a housekeeper, leaving her three children behind in Zimbabwe. She was paid €250 a month to work seven days a week, had her passport confiscated, survived on her employer’s leftovers and banished from the house when she fell ill. Once she was helped out of the cycle of abuse and exploitation, she wanted to give something back to the country.   Her resilience struck me as a journalist, and her story stuck with me as a mother. We remained in touch as she juggled two jobs, saved enough to rent her own place, was reunited with her children, was granted refugee status and read for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the University of Malta. But despite being given the go-ahead to settle in Malta, Agnes was not allowed to work within the public health sector. As the world marked Refugee Week this year, we reported that health authorities had told Agnes she was ineligible to work for the government because as a non-EU national, she had not proven she was granted long-term resident status in Malta or that she was married to an EU national. Having a refugee status, they confirmed, did not make her eligible for the post. Unfortunately, Agnes is not the only one in this position… she is just the only one brave enough to speak up.   When people experience a tragic, unjust loss, they are often reluctant to speak to us journalists. They think we are out to get them and lawyers advise them to stay away. But more often than not, this sentiment changes, and they realise that the media may be the only answer to the inaction. In 2023 I interviewed several people who spoke up, for the first time, years after an incident occurred. It is always a humbling privilege to be trusted with their sensitive stories. The sisters of Sion Grech opened up – 18 years after Sion was murdered – about their devastation that no one was found guilty of the crime. They blamed the justice system for the outcome. Desiree Grech Rosso felt the law that allowed her fathers’ alleged killers to “get away with murder” should change. Her father, Albert Brian Rosso, disappeared in 2005. The two men charged were cleared after statements in which they admitted to the murder were scrapped by the courts. The son of Lino Cauchi, Paolo, described how his life was shaped by his father’s murder. Cauchi went missing on February 1982, when his wife was three months pregnant with Paolo. In 2023 the family was awarded €615,000 compensation for shortcomings in the investigations. The murder remained unsolved.   Catherine Degabriele appealed for someone to speak up a year after her husband, army sergeant Christian Degabriele, was killed when he was hit on the head by a boat’s propeller while diving. The siblings of femicide victim Bernice Cassar spoke about how nobody from the state had apologised to them for the various shortcomings that left Bernice’s two children motherless. Days later, the prime minister apologised to them on the state’s behalf.   In April, an article I wrote made me realise the impact of journalism. A month and a half earlier, I learnt of four university students who had been arrested and strip-searched; at the time, it was described to me as “unjust” and “unlawful”. “How so,” I asked. These four students had found a security flaw in a local business’s software and had sent an email to the company informing them that people’s data was at risk. Email addresses, location data and Google calendars were all exposed. In the email, they followed a global practice and asked the company for a bug bounty: prize money that many tech companies offer and reward white hat hackers for finding bugs, errors and flaws within their software.   Instead of receiving a reward, the students ended up being arrested under suspicion of unauthorised access. After many interviews over the next month – where I had to scramble to learn the intricacies of data protection – and many drafts that did not quite cut it, the story finally came out. “'We wanted to help': Students arrested after exposing FreeHour security flaw,” the headline read, with a photo of the four of them beneath it. I remember my heart pounding. All that work was now there, condensed into a four-minute read. All I could do was hope people would read it. That morning, when I walked into the office and in group chats, it felt like everyone was talking it. It was one of the biggest thrills. And somewhere in that excitement, I discovered how influential our jobs can be.   No parent should have to bury their child. Two stories that struck me in 2023 were both related to the quest of two mothers seeking justice for their children, who they had to bury prematurely. I would not have wanted to be a hair on Isabelle Bonnici’s body when she learned that the architect responsible for the collapsed timber factory that killed her son, Jean-Paul Sofia, had blamed him for his own death. And I also wouldn’t have wanted to be in Josephine Boni’s shoes when the court ruled that burying her young daughter in a plastic bag without the parents’ knowledge did not breach her rights or her daughter’s. As a parent, I cannot fathom the hurt these mothers must have endured, still grieving the loss of their precious children.   It was a particularly difficult piece to pen that Adriana Zammit, who is facing criminal proceedings over Sofia’s involuntary homicide, claimed “contributory negligence” by Jean Paul Sofia since the victim should not have been on site at the time of the incident. A magisterial inquiry into the incident found a litany of shortcomings that led to the building’s collapse. In the Boni case, the ruling about the plastic bag burial case came hot on the heels of another judgment in April that exonerated a cement truck driver from all criminal responsibility for Johanna Boni’s death. Boni, 27, was at a stop sign on her motorbike when she was run over on January 5, 2016. She was on her way to work when she was hit by a truck driver. The driver was cleared of criminal negligence after the court ruled that a miscalculated manoeuvre by Boni when she tried to overtake the heavy vehicle had contributed to the fatal impact. This perplexed her parents who wondered how the court could have reached such a conclusion. The Attorney General appealed that verdict, arguing that the magistrate wrongly interpreted the evidence produced during the compilation of evidence. We will see where that appeal leads. But it all makes me wonder what value we are giving to human lives. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Former world champion cyclist charged with causing his wife's death,AFP,"Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has been charged over the death of his Olympian wife, Australian media reported Monday, after allegedly hitting her with a car. Melissa Hoskins, a retired track cyclist who represented Australia at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, died in hospital after suffering what police said were ""serious injuries"" on Saturday evening.  Her husband Dennis, 33, is a highly regarded former professional who won the world time trials in 2018 and 2019, as well as a 2015 stage win in the Tour de France.  South Australia Police said a 33-year-old man, widely reported to be Dennis, had been charged with ""causing death by dangerous driving"" and ""driving without due care and endangering life"".  ""The driver is known to the woman,"" police said, without confirming his name.  The international association of women cyclists said it was ""shocked"" to learn of Hoskins's death.  ""We send our thoughts to those who love her, starting with her children, and were lucky enough to ride with her during an all too short life,"" CPA Women said on social media. Hoskins, 32, rode in the Australian team that won the team pursuit event at the 2015 Track Cycling World Championships in France.

"Two suspected of stealing man's wallet, damaging car in Marsa",Times of Malta,"The police are questioning two suspected thieves in connection with a Marsa robbery on Friday evening. The suspects, a 37-year-old Birżebbuġa man and a 29-year-old woman from Cospicua, are believed to have stolen a man’s wallet from his car and then damaged the vehicle. In a statement on Saturday, the police said the two had first approached a man on Triq is-Salib and asked him for money. As they did so, the woman is alleged to have stolen the man’s wallet from inside the car while the man kicked the vehicle. Both made a quick getaway but the victim immediately filed a police report and described the assailants to officers. Police officers found the woman a short time later at Triq is-Sajjied, Marsa and the man inside a bar nearby. The two are being held for questioning by the police.

Hundreds of survivors of Christmas attacks in Nigeria desperately wait for aid,AFP,"Crammed inside a church in the central Nigerian town of Bokkos, hundreds of survivors of deadly Christmas weekend attacks desperately await aid as they mourn their loved ones killed in the latest spiral of violence in the troubled region. Nearly 200 people died in attacks that began in the evening of December 23 and lasted through the morning of December 26 in Nigeria's Plateau State, wracked by violence for years. Religious and ethnic tensions have for years roiled the province, which lies between the  Muslim-majority north and mainly Christian south. The attacks led to nearly 20,000 people, mostly women and children, leaving some 20 villages around Bokkos and Barkin Ladi. They are now sheltering in 23 camps set up by the Red Cross. ""We were cooking when the gunmen attacked our community. We had to run for our lives. We didn't even know where we were running to,"" said Lucy Joshua, who lost seven members of her family. ""At the moment, I don't know where some of my children and grandchildren are."" Joshua said the survivors had been supported by the Red Cross, while the church and Bokkos residents had provided food and clothes. ""No one from the government has helped us, but we are told that they are coming,"" said Josephine Matthew, whose husband, brothers and children perished, adding that there was a severe shortage of food and water. The church in Bokkos is ill-equipped for the influx and access to drinking water, toilets or medical care are severely lacking.  ""The attackers killed a lot of people. They burned our houses and farm produce. We are really in a sorry situation, we need everything to survive,"" Abigail Moses said. Nuruddeen Hussain Magaji, a local coordinator for the Nigerian Red Cross, said there was a ""dire need"" for aid.  ""They need food, water, clothes, sanitary hygiene products,"" he said, adding that the survivors also needed psychological support to with the trauma.  The identity of the attackers is not yet known.   During a visit to the region on Wednesday, Vice President Kashim Shettima said aid would arrive shortly. ""I will personally supervise it, and ensure that none of it is hijacked by any body,"" said Caleb Mutfwang, the state governor. Yuhanna Audu from the national rescue agency NEMA told AFP that supplies were coming and distribution should start within two days.  Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has ordered ""security agencies to immediately move in, scour every stretch of the zone, and apprehend the culprits"". Northwest and central Nigeria have been long terrorised by bandit militias operating from bases deep in forests and raiding villages to loot and kidnap residents for ransom. Competition for natural resources between nomadic herders and farmers, intensified by rapid population growth and climate pressures, has also exacerbated social tensions and sparked violence. A jihadist conflict has raged in northeastern Nigeria since 2009, killing tens of thousands of people and displacing around two million, as Boko Haram jihadists battle for supremacy with rivals linked to the Islamic State group. UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement he was ""deeply alarmed"" by the Christmas weekend attacks. ""The cycle of impunity fuelling recurrent violence must be urgently broken. The government should also take meaningful steps to address the underlying root causes and to ensure non-recurrence of this devastating violence,"" he said.

"Mosta chapel reported vandalised on Friday, cleaned up by Saturday",Daniel Ellul,"Graffiti sprayed on the façade and side wall of a Mosta chapel were cleaned up by Saturday morning.  On Friday, independent candidate Arnold Cassola, and separately, the Mosta local council said the chapel of St Paul the Hermit, in Wied il-Għasel, had been vandalised. “The mayor, architect Chris Grech, has written to the concerned authorities so that this big mess is remedied as soon as possible,” the council told its Facebook page followers.    Police confirmed that reports were filed and said they were investigating the vandalism.      Photos posted by the local council show several crosses, graffiti tags and an expletive in Spanish spray painted across the lower parts of the rural chapel’s façade and side wall. On Saturday morning, Grech said the green and brown spray paint that defaced the chapel had already been cleaned up by the chapel’s caretaker. The chapel is particular in that it is built in a cave within Wied il Għasel - a valley that is protected for its high landscape and ecological value. The valley is often frequented by hikers, photographers and Mosta residents on short walks.    You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

'Exhausted' Gazans desperate for war to end as Israel presses offensive,AFP,"After nearly three months of deadly strikes, incessant displacements and sputtering humanitarian aid, ""exhausted"" Gazans say they are desperate for an end to the fighting as Israel's war against Hamas looks set to grind on into the new year. The Israeli army kept up its campaign across the length of the Gaza Strip on Friday in the face of mounting international pushback, with UN chief Antonio Guterres reiterating his call for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", and South Africa initiating a case against Israel in international court. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, warned of the growing threat of infectious diseases as fighting displaces more and more Gazans, forcing them ever further south towards the already-overcrowded city of Rafah. ""Enough with this war! We are totally exhausted. We are constantly displaced from one place to another in cold weather,"" said 49-year-old Um Louay Abu Khater from a camp in the southern border city. ""The bombs keep falling on us every day and night. We expect missiles (at any moment), while others are preparing for New Year's Eve celebrations."" The UN says more than 85 per cent of Gaza's 2.4 million people have fled their homes, with many now going hungry and braving the winter rains in makeshift tents. An Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has led to dire shortages of food, safe water, fuel and medicine, with aid convoys offering only sporadic relief. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees said Friday that one such convoy had come under fire from Israeli forces the day before, without causing any casualties. Ahmed al-Baz, 33, said the year drawing to a close had been ""the worst in my life"". ""It was a year of destruction and devastation,"" he said. ""We went through hell and encountered death itself."" ""We just want the war to end and start the new year at our homes, with a ceasefire declared,"" he added.   The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's bloody October 7 attacks on Israel, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. The Palestinian Islamist militants also took about 250 people hostage, more than half of whom remain inside the war zone, some of them believed dead. Israel's relentless military campaign since then has killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Israel's army says 168 soldiers have been killed inside the territory. A Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas say. Speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, a Hamas official said the delegation would give ""observations"" on the proposal and seek ""guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal"" from Gaza. Israel has yet to formally comment on the Cairo plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that ""we are in contact"" with the Egyptian mediators and promised the captives that ""we are working to bring them all back"". The US news outlet Axios and the Israeli outlet Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire. In Rafah, 27-year-old Youssef Ahras told AFP he hoped the negotiations could ""stop the bloodshed... because the price of war is so high"". ""I don't know a lot about the political aspects because as locals, we are busy with our essential needs,"" he said.   South Africa on Friday filed an application at the International Court of Justice to start proceedings against Israel for what it said were ""genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza"". In its filing, it asked the court to ""protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people"". Responding on the social media platform X, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat wrote that ""Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application"". South Africa has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often linking it to its own struggle against apartheid. Pretoria has strongly condemned Israel's response to the Hamas attacks and has recalled all its diplomats from the country, with Israel in turn recalling its ambassador in South Africa. Key Israeli ally the United States, meanwhile, announced on Friday the approval of a $147.5 million sale of 155mm high-explosive artillery munitions and related equipment to Israel from US Army stocks. The secretary of state determined that ""an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale"" of the weaponry, thereby waiving the normal requirement for review by Congress, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

Banks can be held liable for scams that hit clients,Jacob Borg,"Banks could be held partially liable when their clients fall victim to credible-looking scams, according to new guidelines issued by a financial watchdog. The Financial Arbiter has devised a model to apportion blame when banks and other payment providers fail to adequately alert their clients about scams that replicate their normal channels of communication. These often come in the form of an SMS that appears to originate from your bank, and often contains a link taking you to a fake website designed to steal your personal and financial information. In two recent decisions highlighted on the arbiter’s website, Bank of Valletta (BOV) was held party responsible when its clients lost money due to scams. One decision saw financial arbiter Alfred Mifsud order BOV to refund 40% of the losses incurred when a client clicked on a link in an SMS that he believed was from the bank.  RELATED STORIES  Following the instructions given after clicking on the fraudulent link, the BOV client made a payment of €4,250 to a bank account in Lithuania. During the hearings before the arbiter, the client blamed BOV for allowing the fraudster to penetrate its SMS channel and for failing to notice that the payment was fraudulent. On the other hand, the bank maintained that it was fully compliant with the law and that the complainant was entirely to blame for being defrauded due to gross negligence. After consulting with a security expert, the arbiter confirmed that the SMS was a spoof rather than a penetration of the BOV’s systems, and there was nothing the bank could have done to prevent it, other than issue adequate warnings to customers. In this case, the arbiter found the client was 60% at fault for the fraud, with the rest of the responsibility falling on BOV. The client’s fault was increased due to his “full cooperation” with the scammers in making the fraudulent payment. However, the bank was also held partially liable as the client had not received any direct warning about such fraudulent schemes in the months leading up to the scam. The fact that the client did not have experience in carrying out similar payments was also deemed as a mitigating factor. In another decision, a BOV client fell victim to a fraudulent SMS that he thought came from the bank. The message contained a link leading to a website that appeared identical to the bank’s. The client then went on to make a €3,259 payment to the fraudster’s bank account in the Baltics. While the bank argued that the payment could only have been executed because the client followed the fraudster’s instructions, the complainant claimed that BOV had failed to adequately protect him from the scam. In this case, the arbiter initially decided that the client had shown gross negligence, allocating 100% of the blame to him. In conclusion however, the arbiter decided that the responsibility for the fraudulent payment was to be shared between the complainant and the bank, with the bank bearing 20% of the responsibility and the complainant bearing 80%. As a result, the arbiter ordered the bank to pay the complainant €651.80, or 20% of the total amount lost. Geoffrey Bezzina, who chairs the management board within the arbiter’s office, urged all customers who believe they have fallen victim to a financial scam to first lodge a formal complaint with their bank. “Provide as much detail as possible about what occurred. If you disagree with the outcome determined by your bank, you have the right to escalate your complaint to our office,” Bezzina said. Bezzina said that to ensure fairness, consistency and transparency, the arbiter has developed a model to determine responsibility in these cases, thus ensuring that decisions are evidence-based and consistent. “In fact, we encourage banks to revisit complaints from the past few months and proactively apply this model, potentially enabling reasonable reimbursements,” Bezzina said. The arbiter’s office can be reached via the website financialarbiter.org.mt, via freephone 8007 2366 or Whatsapp on 7921 9961.

Lilu King’s request for bail turned down again,Edwina Brincat,"A Criminal Court has turned down Lilu King’s latest request for bail since the prosecution has yet to indicate further witnesses and resolve the issue of additional charges it intended to press, seven months after the start of the case.  The decision comes in the wake of two decrees delivered recently by the Magistrates’ Court presiding over the compilation of evidence against Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty who stands accused of involvement in organised crime, mainly linked to money laundering and drug trafficking.  Elmushraty is pleading not guilty. Since his arraignment in May, his lawyers have filed several requests for bail, repeatedly driving home the fact that although Elmushraty stands accused of involvement in drug trafficking, police lacked sufficient evidence to press drug-related charges against him.  Prosecutors themselves have acknowledged that no drugs were found in the accused’s possession when he was arrested along with two other suspects in a drug raid at St Julian’s.  Then suddenly, seven months down the line, the prosecution informed the court presiding over the compilation of evidence that they wanted to add drug trafficking and involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy to Elmushraty’s charge sheet.  That announcement triggered strong objections by the accused’s lawyers who argued that since the new charges were totally different from the original ones, the prosecution had to start proceedings from scratch.  That meant that the defence could ask for all witnesses heard so far in the compilation, to testify again. In the meantime, Elmushraty  could not face fresh proceedings when he had already spent seven months under preventive custody, the lawyers argued.   RELATED STORIES  Following those submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, decreed that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure laid down by law when seeking to press additional charges.  They had formulated their request verbally rather than in writing, observed the Magistrate, directing the prosecutors to follow the proper procedure.  On that occasion the Magistrate also directed the prosecution to “definitively indicate the witnesses,” specifically civilians, who were still to testify. And until that information was supplied, the Magistrate refrained from delivering a decision on bail and remitted the acts back to the Attorney General’s Office.  Meanwhile on Wednesday, defence lawyers Franco Debono and Jose’ Herrera filed another bail application before the Criminal Court, presided over by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri. On Friday, after hearing further submissions by both parties, the judge delivered a decree observing that the court had taken note of events before the Magistrates’ Court, particularly during the last two sessions.  The court also took note of previous bail decrees in Elmushraty’s case and observed that the prosecution had not yet indicated the witnesses who were still to testify and also to follow proper procedure as directed by Magistrate Frendo Dimech.  Since the court deemed that those issues ought to be resolved first and also because of the fear of tampering with evidence, it was turning down the request for bail.

Man cleared of rape after former girlfriend drops charges,Edwina Brincat,"A man who spent one week in preventive custody after his former girlfriend reported him for rape, has been cleared of all criminal wrongdoing after the woman herself testified that there had been no rape at all.  Hirotaka Miyamoto, a 41-year-old consultant from Sliema, was arrested and remanded in custody last August upon arraignment when he was charged with rape, non-consensual sex and slight injuries in respect of his ex.  He protested his innocence from the very beginning. The accused had gone out with his ex and a friend. The trio returned to his apartment where the woman and her friend decided to spend the night since she claimed to be tired.  The alleged rape was said to have taken place the following morning after the former couple’s friend left the apartment.  The alleged victim claimed that Miyamoto raped her when she refused his sexual advances.  She filed a police report and lodged a criminal complaint (kwerela) that triggered criminal action against her ex.  But when taking the witness stand just over a week later, the woman insisted that she wanted to drop her complaint against the accused.  The court warned her several times about the consequences of such backtracking, but the woman insisted, going even further by saying that there had been no rape.  Through her interpreter, the alleged victim explained that the accused and herself “before… were boyfriend and girlfriend”. The woman insisted that she wanted to drop the case, turning towards the accused to apologise before leaving the courtroom.  That day, the accused was granted bail while criminal proceedings against him continued.  The court also upheld a request by the man’s lawyers for a ban on his name in light of the circumstances of the case.  When delivering judgment the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, lifted that ban. The wrongdoing attributed to the accused was prosecutable only upon the complaint of the alleged victim, observed the court, citing the relative provisions of the Criminal Code.  Since the woman had insisted on oath that she wanted to withdraw her criminal complaint, the court cleared the accused of all criminal charges.  Sources informed Times of Malta that Miyamoto’s former girlfriend has since left Malta for good.  Lawyers Joseph Brincat and Maria Karlsson were counsel to the accused.

Marsa murder suspect was recorded on CCTV walking away from crime scene,Edwina Brincat,"A man suspected of committing a double murder in Marsa on October 15 was seen walking away from the crime scene, bare-chested, carrying a long metal object, raising his arms whilst shouting ‘Allahu akbar,’ a court was told on Wednesday. More details about the dynamics of the crime emerged on Wednesday when one of the prosecutors testified in the compilation of evidence against 34-year old Ghanaian national Iddrisu Faisal who is pleading not guilty to the murder of his landlords Joe Bartolo and his partner Carmen Abela. Faisal also stands charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm in respect of a brother and sister who were renting rooms at the former horse riding school on Triq it-Tigrija where the murders took place.  During a previous sitting the court heard two other co-tenants testify about how Bartolo regretted taking in Faisal as a tenant after rent-related arguments repeatedly broke out between them. Matters came to a head on that Sunday morning of October 15. A neighbour cleaning out bird cages on the roof of his residence across the street from the Marsa stables had reported hearing screams. He saw a dark-skinned man banging with all his might on the farmhouse door with a long metal object.   Horse-mounted policemen were the first to reach the crime scene from their stables nearby, said Inspector Wayne Camilleri when testifying on Wednesday. The victims were found inside their private quarters, face up on the floor, their lifeless bodies visible through the smashed wooden front door, their heads lying in a sizeable pool of blood. Relatives of the couple soon confirmed their identity. The suspected aggressor was arrested soon after. He was agitated and had to be tasered. The man was subsequently escorted to Mater Dei hospital where he kept up his aggressive behaviour and had to be administered tranquilizers. Meanwhile, a magisterial inquiry kicked off and various experts were appointed to assist in the investigation. CCTV footage from a camera installed just outside the farmhouse showed the bare-chested accused walking away from the crime scene, a metal bolt cutter in his hands. He raised his arms shouting ‘Allahu akbar’ and jumped over a gate leading to Water Services Corporation premises nearby. The suspect was chased by one of the tenants who caught up with him and succeeded in wresting the bolt cutter from his hands, just as police arrived. The weapon was placed inside a police vehicle and was later handed over to forensic officers. At the back of the farmhouse, inside some stables converted into five sleeping quarters, police also found traces of blood. That was allegedly where the accused had attacked two fellow tenants. Faisal’s room, the first on the left, was photographed and searched by scene of crime officers. On a chair next to the bed, they found the accused’s personal documents consisting of a Ghanaian passport, an Italian permesso di soggiorno, as well as an Italian ID card and expired Italian passport. There were also some €1000 in cash. A postmortem examination confirmed that Bartolo and Abela had suffered blunt trauma to their head and both had skull fractures which were compatible to blows inflicted by some heavy object. The suspect was discharged from hospital that same day and was escorted to police headquarters for questioning. He first sought legal advice over the phone. But during his interrogation, Faisal first pretended not to understand and then told investigators that he was not sure whether the person he had spoken to on the phone was truly a lawyer. So the interrogation was suspended until legal aid lawyer Joseph Brincat arrived at police headquarters. However, after consulting the lawyer, the suspect threw a tantrum, dropping to the floor and claiming that he was not feeling well. “He was purposely playing up to avoid releasing a statement,” Inspector Camilleri claimed. Police also examined calls by Abela to emergency number 112, merely seconds before her death. The woman was clearly panicked, telling the person at the other end that an aggressive dark skinned man had managed to break into their home. There was banging in the background as Abela shouted out, “go away, go away.” Then she screamed and suddenly the line went dead. The case, before Magistrate Gabriella Vella, continues. AG lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Ramon Bonett Sladden are prosecuting together with Inspectors Kurt Zahra and Wayne Camilleri. Lawyers Joe Brincat and Julia Micallef Stafrace are legal aid counsel. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri are appearing parte civile. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Sri Lanka detains nearly 15,000 in drug crackdown",AFP,"Sri Lanka's police announced Sunday the arrests of nearly 15,000 people during a week-long military-backed anti-narcotics drive, a crackdown denounced by rights activists. Police said their operation, code-named ""Yuktiya"" or ""Justice"", led to the seizure of almost 440 kilograms of narcotics, including 272 kg of cannabis, 35 kg of hashish and nine kilograms of heroin.  Authorities believe the Indian Ocean island is being used as a drug trafficking transit point. A police statement said 13,666 suspects were arrested while nearly 1,100 addicts were detained and sent for compulsory rehabilitation at a military-run facility. Local media showed footage of police and soldiers using sniffer dogs to search homes in the capital and elsewhere. Police said raids will pause for the Christmas holidays as officers needed to be deployed on security-related duties, but will resume after Tuesday, which is a Buddhist holiday. Human rights lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah said the police raids were illegal as they were conducted without search warrants and urged victims to get the details of officers to initiate legal action later. Rights activist Ambika Satkunanathan posted on social media that the searches were not based on evidence but were ""targeting only poor areas"".  The police were arresting drug users and small-time dealers but ""not focusing on large-scale traffickers"", she added. Sri Lanka's biggest drug haul by weight was in December 2016, when police seized 800 kilograms of cocaine. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Two held after France grounds plane over suspected 'human trafficking',AFP,"French police were questioning two men Friday a day after officials grounded a Nicaragua-bound plane carrying more than 300 Indian passengers over suspected ""human trafficking"", prosecutors said. The Airbus A340 had flown in from the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, landing at Vatry airport in eastern France for a technical stopover. It was held by French authorities after an anonymous tip-off that it was carrying passengers ""likely to be victims of human trafficking"", the Paris prosecutors office told AFP. The two men in custody were among the passengers.   ""Identity checks are being carried on the 303 passengers and on the cabin crew,"" said the prosecutor's office. They were also checking the conditions in which the passengers were being transported and the purpose of their journey. The national anti-organised crime unit JUNALCO is leading the investigation, said prosecutors. According to a source familiar with the case, the passengers might have planned to travel to Central America in order to attempt illegal entry into the United States or Canada. After landing in France, they were first kept on the aircraft, but then let out and given individual beds in the terminal building. The Indian embassy in France said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that the authorities in Paris had informed them of the situation. ""Embassy team has reached & obtained consular access,"" it added. ""We are investigating the situation, also ensuring wellbeing of passengers."" On Friday, police and gendarmes cordoned off the entire airport and white tarpaulin sheets covered the bay windows of the airport's arrivals hall, an AFP journalist at the scene noted. The prefecture in the north-eastern department of Marne said the A340, operated by Romanian company Legend Airlines, ""remained grounded on the tarmac at Vatry airport following its landing"" on Thursday. Legend Air has a small fleet of four aircraft, according to the Flightradar website. The plane had been due to refuel and was carrying 303 Indian nationals who had probably been working in the UAE, it said. Liliana Bakayoko, who said she was a lawyer for the airline, told AFP the company believed it had done nothing wrong, had committed no offence ""and is at the disposal of the French authorities"". But the airline would take legal action if the prosecutors file charges, she added. The Vatry airport, located 150 kilometres east of Paris, serves mostly budget airlines. Border police can initially hold a foreign national for up to four days if they land in France and are prevented from travelling on to their intended destination. French law allows for that period to be extended to eight days if a judge approves it, then another eight days in exceptional circumstances, up to a maximum of 26 days. Human trafficking carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in France. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"French love triangle ends in killing, shallow grave",AFP,"An amorous triangle deep in the French countryside has come to a grisly end, prosecutors said Friday after arresting a man who shot his rival and buried him in a field. The shooter, a farmer in his early 30s, confessed to the killing which he said was prompted by a rivalry for the love of a woman, said Etienne Manteaux, the prosecutor in the eastern city of Besancon. Police investigated when the victim - 22-year-old Loan Bernede living in Cuisia, a village of barely 400 souls in the Jura region - went missing last month. The suspect said he had found out that Bernede was sleeping with a woman that he, too, had a love relationship with. He fetched a gun and shot his rival in the head with a .22 calibre bullet, Manteaux told reporters. The suspect then dumped the body in a shallow grave he had shovelled out in a field on his farm. Police at first interviewed him only as a witness, finding no reason to detain him. But then he ""panicked"" and rushed to dig up and move the body, Manteaux said. He carried it into an animal trough, poured 10 litres of petrol over it and set it on fire. After a blaze lasting seven hours, he probably discarded the ashes in a river, according to the prosecutor. Police finally closed in when a witness came forward claiming ""somebody close to him"" had asked to borrow a van to move the body of a man he had killed. This had happened in November, around the time that Bernede went missing. After his confession, the farmer was charged with murder and incarcerated. The murder weapon has not been found.

UK teen gets indefinite hospital order for 'Grand Theft Auto' hack,Times of Malta,"A British teenage hacker has been sentenced to an indefinite hospital stay to be treated for his inability to control himself online. Arion Kurtaj, 18, was found responsible by a British court in August of carrying out one of the biggest breaches in the history of the video game industry between August 2020 and September 2022 when he went on an unprecedented hacking spree that targeted the makers of ""Grand Theft Auto"", among others. A jury concluded that Kurtaj, whom psychiatrists deemed unfit to stand trial, had carried out numerous computer misuse, fraud and blackmail offences.  Prosecutors described him as one of the ""key players"" in the so-called Lapsus$ group that hacked Rockstar Games in 2022 and published footage from its still unreleased ""Grand Theft Auto 6"". He also threatened Rockstar that he would leak the hacked source code for its latest Grand Theft Auto releases onto internet forums. Kurtaj received the hospital order at Guildford Crown Court near London on Thursday, City of London police said in a statement. British media reported that Kurtaj, who has autism, will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger. Kurtaj and a 17-year-old youth, whose name cannot be published because of his age, were also accused of hacking software company Nvidia in February 2022 and threatening to release its intellectual property. Prosecutors said the pair hacked the servers of broadband provider BT and mobile operator EE before demanding a $4 million ransom. The 17-year-old was sentenced to a youth rehabilitation order for fraud and blackmail on Thursday. In a statement, City of London police urged parents to make sure they know what their children are up to online. ""This case serves as an example of the dangers that young people can be drawn towards whilst online and the serious consequences it can have for someone's broader future,"" said detective chief superintendent Amanda Horsburgh. Grand Theft Auto 5, the last iteration of the game that revolves around heists and street violence, was released in 2013 and has since sold 190 million copies and generated some $8.5 billion in revenue. Earlier this month, Rockstar released a trailer for the sixth instalment of the game, expected to be released in 2025.

"Peru seizes 4,000 live Amazon turtles at airport",AFP,"Peruvian authorities have seized some 4,000 turtles that originated in the Amazon at the country's main international airport, the national wildlife service said Thursday. The National Forestry and Wildlife Service said in a statement it has intercepted ""a shipment of live turtles at the Jorge Chavez airport that were going to be exported to Indonesia."" Among the reptiles were baby Arrau turtles - the largest river turtle in South America - and the yellow-spotted river turtle, which were found in small transparent plastic containers inside cardboard boxes.   Both turtles are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora Appendix II, which requires the tracking and regulation of trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the yellow-spotted river turtle, the second largest freshwater turtle in the Amazon, as vulnerable to extinction. According to Interpol, the black market for illegal wildlife products are worth up to $20 billion per year, and is pushing many species to the brink of extinction. CITES says that tortoises and turtles are one of the most threatened groups of animals in the world. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Gunman kills 14, wounds 25 at Prague university",AFP,"Updated Friday 6.30am A 24-year-old student killed 14 people and wounded 25 at a Prague university on Thursday in the Czech Republic's worst shooting in decades, before authorities said the attacker was ""eliminated"". The violence in the city's historic centre sparked evacuations, a massive response by heavily armed police and warnings for people to stay indoors.   The shooting erupted at the Charles University's Faculty of Arts, which sits near major tourist sites like the 14th-century Charles Bridge. ""At this moment I can confirm 14 victims of the horrible crime and 25 wounded, of which 10 seriously,"" police chief Martin Vondrasek told reporters after the shooting. All the victims were killed inside the building, he said. Media said at least some were the gunman's fellow students. The Dutch foreign ministry said one of the injured was a Dutch national. Vondrasek added the gunman, previously unknown to the police, had a ""huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition"" and that quick police action prevented far more serious carnage. The government declared a day of national mourning on December 23, with flags on official buildings to be flown at half-mast and people asked to observe a minute's silence at noon. Lists of missing students were shared on social media while those safe from the shooting posted messages to inform their friends and relatives. Vondrasek said police started a search for the man before the mass shooting as his father had been found dead in the village of Hostoun west of Prague. The gunman ""left for Prague saying he wanted to kill himself"", Vondrasek said. Police suggested earlier the gunman had killed his father. Police searched a Faculty of Arts building where the gunman was expected to show up for a lecture, but he went to the faculty's main building nearby and they did not find him. ""At 1359 GMT, we received the first information about the shooting,"" Vondrasek told reporters, adding the rapid response unit was on the scene within 12 minutes. ""At 1420 GMT, the officers in action told us about the gunman's motionless body,"" Vondrasek said, adding unconfirmed information showed he had killed himself.  Citing a probe into social media, Vondrasek said the gunman was inspired by a ""similar case that happened in Russia"", without going into details. Vondrasek said police believed the same gunman had also killed a young man and his two-month-old daughter in a pram during a walk in a forest on the eastern outskirts of Prague on December 15. The police investigation into the murder that had shocked Prague was deadlocked until evidence found in Hostoun linked the gunman with the crime. Vondrasek said no police officer was wounded in Thursday's action. Police evacuated the building, using a concert hall across the street as a temporary refuge for the evacuees. Czech President Petr Pavel said he was ""shocked"" by the violence and expressed ""deep regret and sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the victims"". Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the ""lone gunman... wasted many lives of mostly young people"". ""There is no justification for this horrendous act,"" he added. The worst shooting since the Czech Republic emerged as an independent state in 1993 also prompted messages of support from across the world. US President Joe Biden sent his condolences, slamming the ""senseless"" shooting. ""The president and the first lady are praying for the families who lost loved ones and everyone else who has been affected,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. French President Emmanuel Macron also expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Czech people, as did other European leaders including EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said there was no link between the shooting and ""international terrorism"".  He added that ""no other gunman has been confirmed"".  Police cordoned off the area and asked people living nearby to stay at home. Prague's emergency service said on X that ""a large number of ambulance units"" were deployed at the faculty. Though mass gun violence is unusual in the Czech Republic, the nation has been rocked by some instances in recent years. A 63-year-old man shot seven men and a woman dead in 2015 before killing himself in a restaurant in the southeastern town of Uhersky Brod. In 2019, a man killed six people in the waiting room of a hospital in the eastern city of Ostrava, with another woman dying days later. The man shot himself dead about three hours after the attack.

"Man who set bins on fire to refund costs, gets suspended sentence",Edwina Brincat,"Updated 3.15pm, recasts with arraignment A man who admitted to setting some Greenpak bins on fire at Paola on Tuesday was handed a suspended sentence and ordered to refund the company €4,900 plus VAT.  Marco Farrugia, a 49-year-old Cospicua resident working as a cleaner in a school, was charged with wilfully setting the bins on fire in the early hours of Tuesday between 3 and 6am. He was also charged with wilful damage to the detriment of Greenpak.  Investigations kicked off as soon as the Paola police received a report about the fire.  A video of the incident was shared on social media triggering some furore, explained prosecuting inspector Mario Xiberras.  The suspect was tracked down after police got information that the man most likely worked at a school in the south of the island.  Xiberras headed there on Wednesday morning.  The minute he and a colleague arrived, they spotted the suspect standing by the front door.  The man somehow recognised one of the officers, turned and headed indoors at a fast pace.  He was arrested and read his rights.  The accused pleaded guilty upon arraignment on Thursday and confirmed that plea after given time to reconsider.  The company had informed the police that the seven i-Bins cost €700 each, excluding VAT.  When making submissions on punishment, legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia argued that the accused had an untainted criminal record, had fully cooperated and was sorry for what he did.  He was willing to reimburse the damages.  A minimum punishment was appropriate in the circumstances, said the lawyer. After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, condemned the accused to two years imprisonment suspended for four years.  He was also ordered to refund Greenpak for the seven bins costing €700 each and to do so within 36 months.  AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov together with inspectors Mario Xiberras, Jeffrey Scicluna and Antonello Magri prosecuted. Lawyer Martin Farrugia was legal aid counsel.

MPO to reinstate principal conductor after fraud charges dropped,Times of Malta,"The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra will be reinstating principal conductor Maestro Sergey Smbatyan to his former position after he was cleared in Armenia of alleged fraud. Sergey Smbatyan was suspended from his role in the orchestra in July after international media reported that he and his father - a former Armenian ambassador to Israel - were arrested on charges related to real estate fraud in their native Armenia.  In a statement, Smbatyan’s lawyers last month said that the Armenian prosecutor’s office had decided to stop pursuing the charges against him.

Parliament gives assets freezing bill a second reading,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Parliament on Monday greenlighted the second reading of the government's bill to reduce asset freezing for people accused of financial crime. The bill made it through the second reading with 42 votes in favour and 34 against. Government MPs voted in favour while Opposition MPs voted against the law that was proposed just three weeks ago. If approved upon the third reading, the new law would proportionalise the assets frozen by the court with the financial crime someone is being investigated for or accused of. Currently, someone accused of a financial crime can have most of their property seized by the court. The government wants to limit the amount of assets frozen to the amount suspected to have been defrauded. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard announced the bill in the last week of November, arguing the government acknowledged that criminal law was punitive but could not turn into an injustice itself. But the Opposition is questioning why the law is being fast-tracked through parliament days before Christmas, insisting it is designed to protect powerful people who are accused of corruption. The bill will now go to the committee stage, where it will be debated by the committee for the consideration of bills. After that, it is expected to be approved into law on the third reading. When the law started being debated in parliament last week, Attard said if approved, it would strike a fair balance for everyone as ""fundamental rights make no distinction"". But PN MPs argued that while a few elements of the bill are laudable, it appears the bill was designed to help the powerful. Karol Aquilina said it seemed like it was being given as a Christmas gift to someone. He would not say to whom but said everyone knew who he was referring to. It appears he was referring to former prime minister Joseph Muscat. Speculation has been mounting that Muscat could face court in connection with the ""fraudulent"" hospitals' deal. But Attard denied the government had ulterior motives for fast-tracking the bill, telling Times of Malta the accusation was ""baseless"" and ""ridiculous"". He insisted that the legislation was not aimed at anyone and had been given priority after the courts pointed out several times that the current law threatened fundamental rights. In a reaction, Muscat said he did not even know what the bill was about. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Man who punched ex in face, fracturing her nose, is remanded in custody",Matthew Xuereb,"A man's pleas not to be sent to prison after he was charged with punching the mother of his child in the face, fracturing her nose in the process, went unheeded on Monday after a magistrate ordered that he be remanded in custody.  Before magistrate Victor Axiak, 28-year-old salesman Tyson Bugeja, from Cospicua, pleaded not guilty to seriously injuring his ex-partner on Saturday when he repeatedly punched her in the face. He was also accused of attacking, insulting or threatening the woman and causing her to fear violence. Bugeja was further accused of breaching three separate sets of bail conditions, as well as with recidivism. He had been accused of damaging an ex-girlfriend’s car and armed robbery in the past. The court banned the publication of the woman’s name but turned down a request for the same ban covering Bugeja’s name. Prosecutor from the Attorney General’s office, Cynthia Tomasuolo, and Police Inspector Colin Sheldon told the court that according to the ex-partner’s version, Bugeja knocked on the woman’s residence and when she opened, he demanded to know whether she was in a relationship with anyone else. He punched her twice in the face, smashing her nose and then called for an ambulance. The Domestic Violence Unit was informed that the victim had filed a police report from her hospital bed. Bugeja was later arrested at his residence after the police obtained an arrest warrant. He too was later taken to hospital after complaining of chest pains. The same happened again in court on Monday when he suddenly complained of pain, with magistrate Axiak ordering that the arraignment be suspended and an ambulance called to court to examine the defendant. The man threw himself to the ground, saying: “I don’t want to go to prison… I didn’t do anything. I’m tired of spending time in prison for nothing”. Tomasuolo strongly objected to the man’s request for bail, telling the court that his criminal record was a testament to his character. She also pointed to the early stage of the proceedings in which the victim had not yet testified. Defence lawyer George Anton Buttigieg said his client had been on bail and a protection order had previously been issued in favour of the victim. The woman had subsequently moved away from the address specified on the protection order. He added that the injuries had not been inflicted by his client. After considering all arguments, the court turned down the request for bail, ruling that it was not sufficiently assured that the defendant was trustworthy enough to be released.

Police raid Sicily by Car office in fraud probe,Matthew Xuereb,"Police from the financial crime unit have raided the Sicily by Car rental franchise as part of a fraud investigation, seizing several card payment machines and other equipment.  Sources said the police raided the Italian car rental company’s office at Malta International Airport on Tuesday. The Maltese franchise holder is notorious entrepreneur and alleged kidnapper Christian Borg.  Sources said the raid was conducted by the police Financial Crimes Investigations Department. Some 10 officers descended on the company’s airport office, seizing several EPOS machines and other equipment, including laptops and computers.  It is understood that the raid was part of a wider fraud investigation involving the controversial car rental franchise in Malta. Sources said the police entered the premises and ordered everyone to leave.  No arrests were made but the police left with the company’s equipment.    When contacted, a spokesperson for the car-leasing company told Times of Malta they had no comments to make about the matter.  Founded in 1963, Sicily by Car has a network of more than 60 offices across Italy and a car fleet of more than 20,000 vehicles. It took the market by storm in Malta, offering aggressively competitive prices.  The parent company was forced to distance itself from Borg, after he was allegedly involved in a kidnapping. Borg, 30, of Swieqi, was arrested and charged in court in January last year in connection with a botched kidnapping in a case that is believed to have stemmed from the theft of cars.   He is among a group of six who stand accused of kidnapping a man in January last year and threatening to torture him and rape his sister. Borg and two of his associates are also the subjects of a money laundering investigation which is looking into how drugs may have been purchased from the dark web using cryptocurrency.  Borg owns Princess Holdings Ltd, which has run the local franchise for Sicily by Car auto-rental service since 2020. He is also listed as the company's sole director.   RELATED STORIES  Borg resigned as director of his other companies, such as No Deposit Cars, following his arraignment. Those companies are now being run by other people.  Borg used to be a client of Robert Abela when the prime minister used to practise law. The two were also involved in a property deal together. He hit the headlines again last March following revelations by Times of Malta that his car hire-purchase company, No Deposit Cars Malta, made customers sign contracts accepting that their vehicles may have GPS tracking devices installed. Scores of customers have filed judicial protests asking for their contracts with the company to be rescinded and calling for a police investigation into tax evasion and fraud.

Court turns down PN's request to urgently hear hospitals' deal case,Edwina Brincat,"The Opposition’s request for urgency in its case filed against the State Advocate over alleged inaction in recovering funds from the 'fraudulent' hospitals' deal was turned down by the court which, however, observed that the lawsuit deserved priority. It scheduled a first hearing in January.  That was the outcome of a decree delivered by Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti on Friday following objections to the request filed on Thursday by the State Advocate who argued that there was no legal basis for urgency. The State Advocate on Thursday said there was no legal basis for urgency in what was a “purely political case"". Opposition Leader Bernard Grech and Nationalist MP Adrian Delia filed the case on Tuesday, requesting the court to order the State Advocate to take action against “present and past government officials involved in the [hospitals privatisation] deal”.  They followed up that request by calling upon the court to handle the case with urgency since the subject matter was of national interest. After considering the Opposition’s request and the State Advocate’s objections, the Court concluded that it did not sense the need for urgency as claimed by the applicants. Their request was not made within the context of constitutional proceedings.  In this case, upholding the applicants’ request would signify that the Court would have to shorten time limits that are usually applicable in such cases, and schedule the case for hearing irrespective of whatever other cases are scheduled on its list, including those adjourned for judgment.  A party calling for urgency must put forward grave reasons why the case deserves precedence.  The Court did not doubt that this case generated national interest, but the applicants failed to explain why it merited urgent handling.  After all, it was for them to show that if the case is afforded hearing in line with normal procedure - which, after all, provides for expediency in respect of all cases - they or the country would suffer irremediable consequences, observed Mr Justice Grixti.  There was also a “serious distinction” between the applicants’ claims.  They first requested the court to declare that the State Advocate had the power to sue for recovery of the defrauded funds and then asked the court to order the State Advocate to take action.  That second request went far beyond the merits concerning the powers and duties of the State Advocate.  While not envisaging the need for urgency as claimed by the applicants, the court nonetheless felt that this case deserved priority and thus ordered that it be added to the list of cases scheduled for a hearing in the near future.  That hearing is scheduled for January 8. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Top Italian influencer fined €1 million over cake deal,AFP,"Italy's competition watchdog on Friday fined two companies owned by the fashion entrepreneur and Instagram star Chiara Ferragni €1 million for ""unfair commercial practices"" over her endorsement of a cake marketed as raising money for charity. The pandoro cake ""designed"" by Ferragni for the food group Balocco went on sale in November 2022, purportedly to raise funds for the treatment of children with bone cancer in a hospital in Turin. In fact, Balocco had made a fixed-sum donation of €50,000 to the Regina Margherita Hospital months earlier, the competition authority said in a statement. The firms that manage Ferragni's activities, Fenice and TBS Crew, made more than €1 million in the deal ""without paying anything"" to the hospital, it said. Fenice was fined €400,000  and TBS Crew was fined €675,000. Balocco, based near Turin in northwest Italy, was fined €420,000. The authority accused the three companies ""of having implemented an unfair commercial practice by publicising the 'Pandoro Pink Christmas', designed by Chiara Ferragni, implying to consumers that in buying it, they would contribute to a donation"" to the hospital. The pandoro cost around 2.5 times a non-branded version, a markup that ""contributed to misleading customers, reinforcing their perception of being able to contribute to the donation"". Ferragni, who has almost 30 million followers on Instagram, came to prominence with a fashion blog before launching her shoe collection. She went on to collaborate with several fashion brands, including Dior and Chanel, and is part of one of Italy's most famous celebrity couples with her husband Fedez, a rapper and music producer.

Government position for EU not to have competence on rape criticised,Times of Malta,"The Malta Women’s Lobby is requesting the government to reconsider its stance on a proposed EU directive on violence against women. Malta Today reported on Thursday that, together with another 16 EU states, Malta is arguing against the European Union having competence on the prosecution of rape. In its statement, the lobby said that despite the well-documented vulnerability of women in society to gender-based and sexual violence, the Maltese government has chosen to support the removal of rape from a proposed EU directive on violence against women and domestic violence.  This decision, it said, stood at odds with established European legal norms. The directive establishes a consent-based definition of rape across the EU. “This approach aligns with the principles of the Istanbul Convention, an international treaty aimed at combating violence against women."" Malta is a signatory of that convention, which had introduced no consent rape. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard told Malta Today that Malta's law was in line with the proposed directive but Malta was against allowing the EU to have competence on other aspects of national law by casting a wider obligation on other member states. The lobby argued that consent-based definition is vital, particularly given that 11 EU  states continue to predominantly define rape based on the use of force, threat, or coercion. Such definitions have proven to be inadequate in providing comprehensive protection to victims and have often resulted in secondary victimisation, it said. The lobby urged the government to heed the voices of women's organisations, legal associations, survivors, and the hundreds of thousands of citizens who have signed petitions in favour of a robust directive addressing violence against women. Legal experts emphasised that their stance is grounded in legal accuracy and further bolstered by the support of European lawyers, academics, and civil society organisations, including women's advocacy groups, it said. The lobby called on the government to advocate for the inclusion of rape in the proposed directive. Such a reconsideration would represent a significant stride towards the eradication of violence against women and the assurance of justice for victims. “Failure to do so would further highlight the fact that women’s rights are not high on the Maltese government’s agenda, not to mention the total disrespect towards and disregard for victims of rape,” the lobby charged.

"Mobsters nabbed while partying, shopping in Italy",AFP,"One of Italy's most dangerous fugitives has been captured at a party, Italian police said on Thursday, while another mobster was arrested while shopping in a supermarket. Gaetano Angrisano, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for drug trafficking 18 months ago and was on the interior ministry's ""100 most dangerous fugitives"" list, Naples police said. A powerful member of a clan in the notorious Scampia neighbourhood of the southern Italian city, he had been ""a ghost"" who ""escaped handcuffs for a year and a half"", it said. But after establishing he would be at a party in a social housing complex on Wednesday night, some 250 policemen surrounded the block so that ""no-one could get in or out"". ""They flushed him out. Angrisano, who had been invited to a party, had to leave his friends and relatives just after the cake was cut,"" police said. Meanwhile, in Torvaianica, a coastal town just south of Rome, police nabbed a 52-year-old man who was sentenced in November to over 20 years in prison for mafia association and arms and drugs dealing. The man, from Lecce in the south-east of Italy, ""was spotted in the Lazio region while shopping at a supermarket and was immediately arrested"", police said on Thursday. He had been ""a leading organised crime figure in (the southern region of) Salento in the first decade of the 2000s"", it said.

Police said the unmarked delivery truck had stopped for fuel on the outskirts of Sydney when a 28-year-old woman allegedly hopped inside and made off with the freshly baked booty.  Detectives followed a trail of crumbs to a suburban carpark, where they found the abandoned vehicle more than a week later.

Australian police nab man over 17 million scam texts,AFP,"Australian police on Wednesday charged a man living in suburban Sydney with sending 17 million scam text messages, one for almost every adult in the country.  New South Wales police said the unnamed 39-year-old was single-handedly responsible for scam texts that have been plaguing mobile phone users across the country.  The texts included fake links purporting to be from Australia Post or toll road operators and were allegedly sent using ""SIM boxes"" that can send tens of thousands of messages per day. The man was charged with using networked equipment to ""commit serious offence"" and granted bail.  ""SMS phishing is one of the most common tactics deployed by scammers to obtain banking and other personal information from a victim,"" said Jason Smith, commander of the police Cybercrime Squad.

'Culture of violence': youth crime spikes in Greece,AFP,"Katerina vividly recalls the day a younger boy from a nearby school pressed a knife to her friend's throat. Underage crime in Greece is on the rise, official data shows, presenting authorities with a challenge they have never faced at this level before. ""He can't have been over 14 years old - my friend was cracking jokes, he didn't take him seriously at first,"" said the 16-year-old girl in the capital Athens, who asked to be interviewed under a false name. ""That boy peeled off from a group of 20 kids and demanded my friend's cellphone,"" she said, recalling the event two years later. According to police figures, robbery with violence committed by minors aged 13 to 17 rose from 62 in 2000 to over 470 in 2020, while homicides more than doubled from seven to 16, and rapes increased fivefold from six to 32. With school brawls breaking out regularly, police minister Giannis Oikonomou was summoned to parliament on November 6 to address the issue. He said a ""culture of violence"" was growing among youths in Greece, with often ""shocking"" results. ""It reflects a failure of family, of school, of society in general,"" Oikonomou said, adding that police had arrested around 1,300 youths for various crimes and misdemeanours in September. ""It is particularly worrying that the average age of perpetrators is falling,"" Oikonomou said. Experts and officials blame factors including Greece's near-decade economic crisis, and the coronavirus lockdown, for the spread of youth alienation that countries such as Britain, France and Germany are already familiar with. France in 2020 recorded 357 youth gang incidents compared to 288 the previous year, and the interior ministry has identified 74 gangs around the country, 46 just in the Paris region. In Britain, the Children's Commissioner in 2019 estimated that 27,000 children in England alone identified as gang members. Germany, where nationwide figures are harder to come by, has also been shocked by teen killings in recent years. School bullying in Greece is also turning nastier and more frequent, with cases making headlines every week. A study in March supervised by the European Antibullying Network found that one in three Greek school children among nearly 3,000 polled had suffered bullying - mainly at the ages of 13 and 14, and primarily directed at girls, migrants and those from single-parent families. One in six also said they felt their school was not providing adequate instruction against bullying. Much of the violence goes unreported. ""Nobody calls the police - you don't want to get in trouble,"" Katerina said. In June, eight minors were convicted of gang raping a 15-year-old boy in the western Athens district of Ilion. In September, a 16-year-old boy threw a lit flare into a classroom in Langadas, near Thessaloniki. And in November, three teenage girls were arrested for beating a classmate in a schoolyard in the Athens district of Peristeri.   In addition to the 2010-2018 economic crisis that shook the nation, Covid restrictions and the influence of social media are seen as key factors. ""The economic crisis, and the pandemic crisis immediately afterwards, played a major role in children being closed off and feeling very uncomfortable without their friends,"" Nestor Courakis, a criminology expert and professor of law at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, told AFP. ""The result is that they went online, with all that entails in terms of isolation, depression and negative influences,"" he said. ""Youths have become more familiarised with violence."" ""But the situation is not out of control,"" Courakis insisted. Katerina's mother, who also declined to give her name, said the working-class Athens district where the family lives was hit hard by the economic crisis. ""And teens experience economic hardship more than adults do,"" she said. She also blames the growing influence of trap, a subgenre of hip-hop featuring lyrics that detractors say promote violence and objectify women. ""They play trap even at parties in our local primary school, for children younger than nine,"" she said. The government says it has doubled the number of psychologists and social workers at schools to 3,200, and a law passed in March foresees additional training to around 125,000 teachers nationwide.

Canadian faces 14 murder charges for selling suicide kits,AFP,"A former Canadian chef accused of selling suicide kits that lead to deaths in several countries was charged Monday with 14 counts of murder related to suicides in Canada as a result of his online scheme. The charges filed against Kenneth Law, 58, are on top of 14 he already faces for allegedly ""counselling or aiding"" suicides across Ontario province, according to documents. His defense lawyer Matthew Gourlay also confirmed to AFP that Law has been charged with 14 new counts of second-degree murder. Law was arrested in May for marketing a substance that is used as a food additive but can kill if misused. He is said to have targeted vulnerable people online. He is believed to have sent as many as 1,200 packages to people in more than 40 countries since 2020. Toronto police are scheduled to brief the media on the new charges Tuesday. In Britain, at least 272 people purchased products from Law's websites and 88 of them died, police there have said.  Alerted by Interpol, several other countries have launched investigations, including New Zealand and Italy, where nine buyers have been identified and one victim has died. The Canadian victims were both male and female between the ages of 16 and 36, according to police. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Financial crime needs to be fought proportionately,| Stephen Tonna Lowell,"It is trite knowledge that, no matter the nature of the crime, the fundamental human rights of the person charged must be safeguarded. The application of criminal law necessarily goes hand in glove with the respect of fundamental human rights. Proportionality is the determining factor in the delicate balance between public interest on the one hand and the protection of human rights on the other. The lack of proportionality is one of the main causes for findings against member states of the Council of Europe by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Financial crime, despite the difficulties and complexities encountered by investigating bodies, and despite its often controversial nature, comes as no exception. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which was brought into force in 1994, has been amended no less than 27 times, more often than not to bring it in line with Malta’s international obligations. Many times, amendments were introduced fastidiously but, on a couple of occasions, an overzealous legislator lost sight of the principle of proportionality.   Our courts have made it abundantly clear that court orders freezing one’s assets are not intended as a form of anticipated punishment but solely to avoid the dissipation of those assets that could be subject to confiscation in the case of an eventual finding of guilt. The current situation in our procedural laws on financial crime does not reflect this cardinal principle. As things stand, one’s assets may be “attached”, without much scrutiny, for a whole year without charges being filed. The situation when a person is charged is even more serious since, upon a simple and unqualified request by a prosecuting officer, all that person’s property is “frozen” without the possibility of scrutiny by the courts. No investigation into the proportionality between the quantum of the proceeds of the crime alleged and the amount and nature of the property possessed by the person charged is made or can be made. All assets are frozen irrespective of whether they constitute the proceeds of crime or not. There have been cases where the prosecution insisted on the issuing of a freezing order when it was evident that there were no proceeds of crime. Our courts are the ultimate guardians of the safeguarding one’s fundamental human rights and, where more than one interpretation of a law is possible, the one safeguarding such rights should always take precedence. Draconian interpretations of draconian laws are a recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, in recent times, many of our courts have strangely made a dead letter of a crystal-clear provision of law intended to allow the modification of freezing orders. This provision, which actually doesn’t allow for much interpretation, was previously interpreted correctly. If a person is found guilty of a relevant offence, all his property is confiscated in favour of the State. The person found guilty would have to institute fresh civil proceedings to determine which property will be confiscated and which may be retained. This cumbersome remedy is not one against the freezing order but against the order of confiscation. Currently no remedy exists whereby, in the course of the habitual lengthy proceedings before the courts of criminal jurisdiction, the person charged may request the court to remove from the ambit of the freezing order property that was, for example, legally inherited through a public deed and has no connection to the crimes brought against him. The result is serious and unwarranted hardship including the closure of businesses and the cessation of professional activity even in the absence of any finding of guilt. This hardship necessarily extends to family members, co-owners of immovable property and employees who may face layoffs due to the lack of proportionality in the law. Malta must respect its international obligations in the fight against financial crime but it must also respect the fundamental human rights of persons. The European Court of Human Rights has stated that where an interference with one’s property has taken place, subject to the conditions provided for by the law and in the public interest, there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State. A fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. Our courts have, on several occasions, sent warning signals to the authorities that all is not well with the current law in this field. The bill currently before parliament to amend various laws relating to the proceeds of crime is a clear step in the right direction in that it safeguards all the tools for combatting financial crime while not losing sight of the fundamental principle of proportionality.

Man who attacked a drunk clubber has jail term reduced,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who was involved in a fight with a drunk clubber outside a St Paul’s Bay club in 2020 has seen an appeals court shaving four years and four months off his prison sentence after declaring there was not enough evidence to prove it was he who stabbed the victim in the face. Judge Neville Camilleri said although the evidence was clear that he had inflicted slight injuries on the victim, with punches and kicks, there was no such evidence to prove he had seriously injured him. He was ruling in an appeal filed by three former bouncers who used to run security at a St Paul’s Bay club who were jailed after the first court had found them guilty of carrying out the savage attack on an African man outside the club. The victim was stabbed in the face during the incident.  Stepan Stankov, 35, from Bulgaria, had been sentenced to imprisonment for five years and four months. Yermakov Mykhailo, 33, from Ukraine, was jailed for a year for causing slight injury during the same incident, while Dorde Dudic, 29, from Serbia was jailed for 18 months for his part in the attack. Mykhailo and Stankov were additionally found guilty of working as security officers without a police licence. The court heard how the incident had taken place outside Babylon Club on February 16, 2020, at 5am. The incident was not racially motivated, the court was told. The accused blamed a fourth person who had fled the scene. The assault was captured on CCTV, which was exhibited in court.   On appeal, Mr Justice Camilleri said although the footage showed the scale of the assault, it was not clear who had stabbed the victim in the face. He concluded that the victim was hit by all three “and their behaviour clearly defeats their arguments as to how they tried to restrain the victim. “Whilst it is true that the victim kept on coming forward, it is also true he could have been restrained without using the degree of violence used. The victim was punched repeatedly and was also kicked. The bite he inflicted on one of the (bouncers) was clearly inflicted in self-defence,” the court ruled. While confirming the punishment meted to Mykhailo and Dudic, the court said that according to evidence, Stankov was employed as a barman and not a bouncer, so the first court should have given an appropriate punishment. Moreover, the prosecution had not proved to the level required at law that it was he who had inflicted the grievous injury.  He therefore reduced his jail term to one year. Inspector Clayton Camilleri prosecuted. Stankov was represented by lawyers Johann Debono, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, while lawyer Damien Degiorgio appeared for Dudic. Lawyer Johann Debono also appeared for Mykhailo. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Nurses’ union boss faces corruption, financial probe",Mark Laurence Zammit,"The nurses’ union boss is facing two separate investigations over his earnings as the amounts of money paid to him in overtime and on-call allowances have triggered suspicions over the hours claimed. Paul Pace, president of the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses (MUMN), is being investigated by the Permanent Commission Against Corruption and the police’s Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID), Times of Malta can confirm. While the FCID investigation has been ongoing since the end of summer, the corruption commission probe was opened a few weeks ago. Several government officials are being questioned in both investigations. In September, the Public Service Commission found Pace was paid more than he deserved for overtime he claimed to have worked at his full-time job. He was suspended from work for five days and ordered to refund the money. Pace insists the overpayment was simply a human error that amounted to just €215.  RELATED STORIES  But a parliamentary question in October revealed he may have claimed far more hours of overtime than he could have possibly worked, government sources told Times of Malta. Pace’s “suspicious” earnings were revealed in a reply Health Minister Chris Fearne gave to PN MP Albert Buttigieg. Fearne tabled in parliament the amounts paid to Pace in overtime and on-call allowances every year since 2012. The amounts reveal that over several years, Pace appeared to have clocked an “exorbitant” number of hours at his full-time job as a charge nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital. In 2022, for example, he was paid €21,387 for overtime work, which equates to an average of €411 per week. During the same year he was paid €10,861 in on-call allowances on the same job, which means an average of €208 a week. Added to the normal hours of his normal duty roster, the total number of hours he claimed to have worked for or at Mount Carmel Hospital last year is far more than he could possibly have, government sources said. The pattern seems to have been repeated throughout several other years. The suspicion over the generous number of hours Pace claims to have spent on his full-time job was further heightened as sources insist he works at the MUMN offices or on union matters on most days while also doing work as a member of the MCESD and while presiding over meetings of the Maltese unions forum – For.U.M. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2019 Pace was also employed as a consultant for then-health minister Konrad Mizzi – a contract which paid him €15,000 annually for 15 hours of work every week. In the contract he also agreed to a clause binding him to work beyond those hours if need be. Although he had left the MUMN during that period, he still clocked an average of €17,000 worth of overtime hours and €9,000 worth of on-call hours every year at his Mount Carmel full-time job. Pace could not be reached for comment and Times of Malta was unable to confirm how many hours he claimed to have worked on his full-time job in total.

Court rejects AG appeal on 2005 haul of 15 million contraband cigarettes,Matthew Xuereb,"A judge has rejected an appeal filed by the attorney general over a criminal case related to a 2005 haul of 15 million contraband cigarettes found hidden in a container at Malta Freeport. Mr Justice Neville Camilleri rubbished arguments by the attorney general that father and son Arthur and Aaron Ciancio, both from Mellieħa, should have been given a harsher sentence and should have been both found guilty of the charges brought against them. Both were accused of involvement in the racket, which resulted in the massive haul of smuggled cigarettes. The merchandise was worth some €593,000 and was liable to €1.5 million in excise duty and a further €377,000 in VAT. In 2017, after a 12-year-long court process, the court found that the prosecution had not proved Arthur Ciancio’s alleged involvement and conspiracy in the illegal importation of the tobacco products. It, however, convicted him of forgery, falsification of documents and making use of false documents, sentencing him to a jail term of two years, suspended for four years. As for Aaron Ciancio, the court observed that the prosecution had failed to prove its charges, adding that the fact that he was the son of the other accused and lived in the same house did not mean he was guilty. “It brought not one piece of evidence in regard to Aaron Ciancio that he was in any way involved in the crime,” the court had concluded. An anonymous tip-off had alerted the police to the imminent arrival of the merchandise, which was eventually seized by customs officers on Easter Saturday in March 2005.   The relative bills of lading of two containers described them as carrying promotional toys and giftware respectively for two Maltese companies which, upon subsequent investigations, turned out to be non-existent. The first container yielded 421 master cases, each containing 10,000 Regal brand cigarettes. The second turned out to contain 726 cases of contraband merchandise. The attorney general argued that Aaron Ciancio should have been convicted of fraud and falsification of documents and that his father should have also been found guilty of his involvement in the importation of the shipment. The fact that there was a last-minute change of destination of the container in question did not change the intent to commit this crime. But Mr Justice Camilleri threw these arguments out of the window. When containers arrive in Malta for transshipment purposes, it means the merchandise is not destined for Malta and that no taxes are due in Malta. The court said evidence showed Aaron Ciancio was uninterested in his father’s business even though he occasionally helped him out. Mr Justice Camilleri, therefore, rejected the attorney general’s appeal and confirmed the judgment of the first court in its entirety, also throwing out Arthur Ciancio’s appeal that most of the evidence was hearsay and should not have been considered admissible evidence in court. Lawyer Kathleen Calleja Grima was counsel to Arthur Ciancio and lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were counsel to Aaron Ciancio.

Police arrest man following string of thefts in Valletta and Sliema,Times of Malta,"The police on Thursday arrested a 21-year-old man following a string of thefts in Sliema and Valletta on Wednesday. The police said they were on Wednesday at around 9pm informed that a man armed with a knife had entered a shop in Sir Adrian Dingli Street, Sliema and demanded cash from the salesperson, a 37-year-old man who lives in St Paul’s Bay. The thief escaped with cash and other items he stole from the shop. The man is believed to be the same person who, earlier in the day, carried out another two thefts in Sliema and one in Valletta. The first theft was carried out at around 2am when the thief entered a hotel in Old Bakery Street Valletta and stole cash. At around 4am, he made off with cash from a hostel in Triq Sir George Borg, Sliema. The case was in a box behind the reception bench. Soon after, he stole a wallet and a mobile phone from a car in Triq it-Torri,  also in Sliema. Following a number of searches at places the man was known to visit, the police found him in Valletta on Thursday morning and arrested him. Investigations are continuing. The man is expected to be charged in the coming days. An inquiry is being held. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Hip-hop mogul Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs again accused of rape,AFP,"A fourth woman has publicly accused music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs of sexual assault, alleging he and others gang-raped her when she was 17, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday. The filing says Combs – an artist and producer also known as Puff Daddy – met the unnamed woman in 2003 after his associate Harve Pierre singled her out at a lounge in Detroit and convinced her to take a private jet to New York to meet the rapper. Prior to taking the flight, Pierre forced the then 17-year-old to perform oral sex on him before taking her across state lines to Combs’ studio. There, the group of men including Combs plied her with drugs and alcohol before violently raping her repeatedly, the civil suit filed in a federal court in New York alleges. Her lawyer Douglas Wigdor – who also represented R&B singer Cassie, the first woman to publicly come forward against Combs – said that “the depravity of these abhorrent acts has, not surprisingly, scarred our client for life”. It is the fourth lawsuit levelled against Combs alleging similar abuse and rape. The first, from Cassie, was settled two days after it was filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act, a law that opened a one-year window for sexual assault claims to be filed that otherwise happened too long ago to litigate. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations against him. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on Wednesday’s filing. Following Cassie’s lawsuit, plaintiff Joi Dickerson-Neal alleged she had been “drugged, sexually assaulted and abused” in 1992 by the rapper and that he had filmed and distributed the acts as “revenge porn”. Another complaint filed anonymously accuses Combs and music collaborator Aaron Hall of raping her. In recent weeks, an additional lawsuit accused Pierre of abusing his position atop Combs’ label to groom and sexually assault his former assistant. The suit says Combs’ company, Bad Boy Entertainment, looked the other way. Combs, 54, founded Bad Boy in 1993, and was a major figure in hip-hop’s commercialisation over the course of the decades that followed. His proteges included the late Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige. He is among hip-hop’s billionaires, not least due to his ventures in the liquor industry. The recent lawsuits against him describe Combs as a violent man who used his celebrity to prey on and intimidate women.

Three killed in Las Vegas university shooting,AFP,"Three people were killed and another seriously injured by a gunman who was shot dead by police at a US university on Wednesday. The incident at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a short distance from the gambling hub's tourist-packed Strip, was the latest in the United States, where gun violence is a part of the fabric of daily life. ""Three of the victims are confirmed deceased,"" Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told a press conference. He said a fourth victim had been critically injured by the shooting but that condition later upgraded to stable. The identity of the shooter was not immediately released, but CNN and the Los Angeles Times, quoting law enforcement sources, said he was a 67-year-old career college professor with links to schools in Georgia and North Carolina. But it was not clear what affiliation he had with the Nevada university where the shooting took place. US President Joe Biden in a statement decried the latest ""horrific act of gun violence"" to terrorize a college campus. Police responded within minutes to reports of an active shooter at 11:45 am (1945 GMT), McMahill told a press conference. Two officers ""immediately engaged the suspect in a shootout"" and the suspect ""was struck and is deceased at this time,"" said university police chief Adam Garcia. The incident began as an outdoor gathering of students was taking place. ""Students were playing games and eating food, there were tables set up for them to build Legos,"" said McMahill. ""If it hadn't been for the heroic actions of one of those police officers who responded, there could have been countless additional lives taken."" Police did not provide any further information on the identities of the victims or gunman, and are in the process of notifying next-of-kin. One woman told local broadcaster KVVU that she had heard a series of loud noises and fled into a building on the campus, from which she was later evacuated by police. ""I was just having breakfast and then I heard three, like, loud booms,"" she told the station. ""Then two more, and then police showed up there and ran inside... but then after two minutes boom, boom, boom, more shots. So I ran into a basement, and then we were in the basement for 20 minutes."" Officers were continuing to search the campus, which will remain closed through Friday, but ""there is no more ongoing threat to our community,"" the sheriff said. Las Vegas is a gambling and entertainment hub that attracts millions of visitors every year, many of whom come to see large, high-profile events. Last month, the city played host to its inaugural Formula One Grand Prix. It is currently hosting basketball's NBA Cup at the T-Mobile arena, just two miles (three kilometers) away from the scene of the shooting. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James sent condolences to affected families during a press conference Wednesday, in which he also voiced anger about the grim regularity of mass shootings. ""It makes no sense that we continue to lose innocent lives, on campuses, schools, at shopping markets and movie theaters and all type of stuff. It's ridiculous,"" he said. Mass shootings are common in the United States, a country where there are more guns than people, and where attempts to clamp down on their spread are always met with stiff resistance. The country has recorded over 600 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nongovernmental organization that defines a mass shooting as four or more people wounded or killed. The Washington Post, which keeps its own tally of mass shootings, said that as of Monday, there had been 38 such incidents in which at least four people had been killed. Las Vegas was the scene of one of America's deadliest-ever mass shootings, when a gunman opened fire on a crowded music festival in 2017, killing 60 people. Efforts to tighten gun controls have for years run up against opposition from Republicans, staunch defenders of what they interpret as an unfettered constitutional right to weaponry. The political paralysis endures despite widespread outrage over recurrent shootings. ""This is not normal, and we can never let it become normal,"" said Biden. ""For all the action we have taken since I've been President, the epidemic of gun violence we face demands that we do even more. But we cannot do more without Congress.""

Man jailed for sexually abusing underage Paceville clubber,Matthew Xuereb,"A man has been jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to sexually abusing an underage girl in a Paceville nightclub while holidaying in Malta two years ago. Lionel Seux, 51, from France, had a change of heart and pleaded guilty to committing the acts in September 2021. According to evidence that emerged in court during the compilation of evidence, Seux accompanied a 16-year-old girl to the nightclub’s bathroom at around 1am on September 20. Once inside, he locked the door, undressed her and then himself and, subsequently, proceeded to touch her and himself inappropriately. The court heard it was only the incessant banging on the door by the girl’s friend that stopped the accused from doing anything else. After the prosecution rested its case, Seux decided to plead guilty to all the charges brought against him. He was given a chance to reconsider his guilty plea after being warned that the crimes he had committed carry a maximum of nine years in jail. He confirmed his admission when he appeared before Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit. He was convicted of non-consensual sexual advances with a minor and of holding the girl against her will since he locked the bathroom door and did not let her leave. The magistrate said that although he had admitted to the charges, the stage when he filed the admission was late in the proceedings, after the prosecution had brought all its witnesses. He, therefore, could not benefit from the full reduction in punishment as those who file an early guilty plea. The magistrate sentenced Seux to five years and four months in prison and ordered that the time he spent in preventive custody be reduced from the jail time. He was also ordered to pay just under €5,100 in court expenses related to the appointment of court experts. Police inspectors John Spiteri and Leeroy Balzan Engerer prosecuted.

Youth who punched knife-wielding man acted in self-defence - court,Edwina Brincat,"A man who ten years ago ended up with a knife stuck in his back following a violent argument in Valletta was acting in legitimate self-defence when he punched his aggressor on the face, a court declared on Wednesday. The incident, in July 2013, occurred when a group of youths were returning to their car near the Hotel Excelsior after a night out at a wine festival and a stop at the Monalisa Bar. Adam Cini, then 24, and his four friends stopped to admire a yellow motorcycle parked below street level. As they looked down, a man shouted, “ok?” When the youths lingered, the man who lived in a place down below the promenade told them to move on. Cini shouted back, saying that the stranger had no right to order them about since they were doing nothing wrong. A foul-mouthed argument followed and the man, Giovanni Farrugia, challenged Cini to a face-off. As the group of friends were about to leave, they heard shouting and  Cini spotted the man heading towards him, holding a knife.  Farrugia insisted that Cini should apologize for his foul insults but the youth refused and the situation escalated when the elder man brandished the knife in Cini’s face. The youth reacted by grabbing Farrugia’s knife-wielding hand with his left hand whilst using his free arm to punch his aggressor in the face, as one of his friends also stepped in, trying to remove the knife. Meanwhile, another man who was living with Farrugia at the time and who witnessed the incident, suddenly disappeared and came back with a saw with which he threatened the youths unless they let go of his friend. That was when Cini let go and turned to walk away. Suddenly, Farrugia stabbed him in the back. Police who were alerted to the commotion found Cini seated on a low wall in great pain, the knife blade jutting out of his back as his friends huddled around him. He was rushed to hospital in critical condition. Following the incident, Cini was charged with grievously injuring Farrugia who suffered a cut on the face that needed suturing and could leave a scar. When testifying against Cini, Farrugia said that he wanted to drop charges against the youth whom he had since forgiven. Cini’s friends testified, all confirming their original version at the police headquarters after the incident. They had been kept apart until spoken to by the police, but their versions matched and were consistent, corroborating Cini’s version. When all testimonies and other evidence were considered the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, said that there was no doubt about the veracity of Cini’s version. That account was also compatible with the wounds he had suffered on his right hand as he tried to wrest the weapon out of Farrugia’s hand. Farrugia had been very aggressive. Cini’s lawyers argued that he had acted in legitimate self-defence. “The right to legitimate self-defence is a natural consequence of every person’s right to defend himself from some aggression or harm even through the use of force,” observed the court. For the plea of self-defence to succeed in court, the danger posed had to be unjust, grave and inevitable. When assessing the situation, one had to consider the accused’s position at the time, taking into consideration his physical and mental state. In this case, the court said it was morally convinced that Cini was going about his own business, not bothering anyone. It was Farrugia who started it all, going after the youth with a knife and later stabbing him in the back after Cini had let go. Cini was in danger of dying as a result of that stabbing. He had wanted to defend himself as he punched Farrugia, and his actions were justified in the light of the present, sudden and absolute danger he faced, said the Magistrate, pronouncing an acquittal. Lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo were defence counsel. Farrugia was separately convicted five years ago of causing grievous injuries and sentenced to five years imprisonment which on appeal were reduced to two years.

'Turn tragedy into change': Italy mourns femicide victim,AFP,"Thousands of Italians paid their last respects Tuesday to a university student killed by her ex-boyfriend, a case that has triggered nationwide grief and rage at violence against women.  The funeral of 22-year-old Giulia Cecchettin at a basilica in Padua, near Venice, attracted fellow students, public officials and ordinary Italians in a show of solidarity against one of the country's most recent and most shocking episodes of femicide. Cecchettin, who was studying biomedical engineering at the University of Padua, was stabbed to death last month by her former boyfriend, fellow student Filippo Turetta, who confessed to the murder before a judge, according to his lawyer.  Under grey skies, pallbearers carried Cecchettin's rose-covered coffin into the Basilica of Santa Giustina, where mourners included Italy's justice minister, as thousands of people gathered in the piazza outside.  ""Giulia's life was cruelly taken, but her death can and must be the turning point to end the terrible scourge of violence against women,"" her father, Gino, said in his eulogy. ""In this time of grief and sadness we need to find the strength to react, and turn tragedy into a push for change,"" he added. He implored men to ""challenge the culture that tends to minimise violence by men who appear normal"". The killing of Cecchettin, who was due to graduate just days after her death, was front-page news in Italy and ushered in a period of national reflection on violence against women. The couple disappeared on November 11. Turetta was found in Germany a week later, the day after Cecchettin's body was found in a gully near Lake Barcis, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) north of Venice.  She had been stabbed more than 20 times in the head, neck and body, according to local media, citing the autopsy report.  Marking what activists had hoped would be a turning point in Italy, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Rome, Milan and other cities on November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, calling for cultural change. Giorgia Meloni, the country's first woman prime minister, assured women on Facebook ""they are not alone,"" reminding them of the call-centre number for victims of violence or stalking.    According to the interior ministry, as of November 26, 107 women in Italy were murdered this year, of whom 88 were killed by family members or current or former partners. Inconsistent official data on femicides makes comparisons with other European countries difficult. Following Cecchettin's death, Italy's parliament adopted a package of bills to strengthen existing laws to protect women. But critics say a cultural change is needed in the treatment of women, starting with compulsory education on the topic in schools.  Despite the recent attention, many see such crimes continuing unabated in the majority-Catholic country, where traditional gender roles still hold sway in many areas, with fewer women working outside than home than the EU average and where abortion is hard to access.  A July 2021 report from the government's department of gender equality found that ""while violence is unacceptable for more than 90 percent of people, in some regions of Italy up to 50 percent of men consider violence in relationships to be acceptable.""  In a speech last month, the newly appointed president of the Tribunal of Milan, Fabio Roia, who has advocated for better training on gender violence among prosecutors, judges and law enforcement, warned that much was yet to be done.  ""Violence against women that goes as far as femicide is a cultural and social problem, and unfortunately the power imbalance in gender relations is still strong,"" said the judge.  A 2020 independent report measuring Italy's compliance with the Council of Europe's convention on preventing violence against women encouraged more extensive awareness campaigns and better training of professionals, among other measures.  It also recommended Italy ""pursue proactive and sustained measures to promote changes in sexist social and cultural patterns of behaviour, especially of men and young boys, that are based on the idea of inferiority of women"". The report also urged Italy to put in place national guidelines for education in schools on ""affectivity, sexuality and reproductive health"".

Man accused of raping teen out on bail after arrest debacle,Edwina Brincat,"A man has been accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in the gardens of a St Julian's hotel four years ago.  Keith Azzopardi, 30, from Cospicua, who, until Tuesday was in preventive custody over a separate criminal case, was escorted to court on Monday afternoon, facing charges for a crime he allegedly committed in September 2019. The case came to light when a pediatrician who examined the minor in hospital flagged the matter to the police.  The girl had opened up about how Azzopardi had raped her in the gardens of a St Julian’s hotel. She told him to stop. Later, the accused approached the girl and her mother at a Christmas party, telling them not to cause him trouble since he was a father of two.  The alleged victim was afraid to report him to the police, explained prosecuting Inspector Roxanne Tabone who learnt about the case when previously stationed at the Vice Squad.  On Monday, Azzopardi denied charges of rape, engaging in a non-consensual act with the minor, holding her against her will, giving her alcohol as well as relapsing. His defence contested the validity of the arrest stressing the fact that four years had lapsed since the alleged incident.  It was time for the courts to pronounce themselves on the distinction between an arrestable offence, namely where arrest was justified and arraignment under arrest, defence lawyer Franco Debono argued.  He explained further that although an offence might justify arrest, that did not necessarily mean that the suspect was to be arraigned under arrest.  And that argument gained ground especially when a considerable time lapsed between the commission of the offence and the date when the offence is charged in court.  In such cases, the suspect could be charged by writ of summons rather than under arrest. Since the accused had been under preventive custody for relating to domestic violence, the arrest warrant was executed at the Corradino Correctional Facility. In Azzopardi’s case, the alleged victim had reported the incident shortly after it allegedly happened but the prosecution had arraigned the suspect now. Under cross examination, the prosecuting officer said that police had investigated the case when the girl filed her report and then handed over everything to the Attorney General. The prosecution insisted that the case was a serious one and merited arraignment under arrest, even because Azzopardi had previously approached the victim and her relatives.  After hearing submissions the court upheld the defence’s argument, declaring that the arrest was not valid.  Without detracting from the gravity of the alleged offences, the court, presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, stated that arresting the suspect in 2023 over an offence allegedly committed in 2019 was not valid.  The court also observed that although the accused had approached the alleged victim and her family, that did not happen recently.  The court issued a protection order in favour of the victim and her relatives while the rape case against Azzopardi continues.  On Tuesday, the accused was given bail in the domestic violence case. AG lawyers Angie Vella and Cynthia Tomasuolo prosecuted together with Inspector Roxanne Tabone. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Jeweller still unable to communicate four months after hold-up attack,Edwina Brincat,"A jeweller who was savagely beaten up during a hold-up in August is still in hospital and unable to communicate, a court was told on Tuesday. Joseph Carabott was found hands tied and face down on the floor of his Żurrieq shop after being beaten and robbed by a gang of three. A medico-legal expert described his condition when he testified in the compilation of evidence against Donna Borg Sciberras, 29, Mohamed Anas Boualam, 37 and Zuhair Hadoumi, 26 who are pleading not guilty to attempted murder, grievous injuries, holding the victim against his will and aggravated theft.  RELATED STORIES  Mario Scerri said that Carabott suffered severe head injuries as a result of a beating that was so forceful that the victim was unable to communicate. He had spent time in intensive care and was later moved to a ward but when he checked on him just a few days ago, “he [Carabott] had no sense of surroundings. He knew nothing (La jaf fejn hu. Ma jaf xejn.)” explained Scerri. Asked about the chances of the victim’s recovery to such an extent that he would be able to testify, the expert said that probably Carabott would not be able to communicate. “Sometimes they do recover. But this is a very bad case. Prognosis is poor.” The victim’s son had previously described how that August 25 evening he had gone to the shop after his father, who was usually very punctual, failed to turn up after normal closing time. Finding the shutter lowered, he peered through it and saw his father bound on the floor. He finally gained access to the shop by smashing a side window and rushed to his father who was lying unconscious, face covered in blood. The shop cases were shattered and there were signs of theft. Police Inspector Shaun Pawney presented the court with a visual report consisting of several images compiled in chronological order, creating a timeline of events based on CCTV footage linked to the crime scene and information gathered from third parties.   CCTV footage from a residence opposite Carabott’s corner shop proved useful and other footage was gathered from two commercial outlets, including one on Blue Grotto Avenue which showed the three suspects leaving in a cab. The trio had also taken a taxi ride to Zurrieq that evening. The cab driver, when tracked down, confirmed the booking and also handed police footage from his dash cam which clearly showed the three suspects. They got out of the cab some 50 or 60 metres away from the jeweller’s shop, wearing summer clothes as they walked down Carmelo Caruana Street parallel to Stiefnu Zerafa Street. Then suddenly, they put on hoodies as they headed towards the shop shortly before 7pm. Boualam was carrying a bag that matched one found later at the  Sliema property where the suspects were arrested. Borg Sciberras went into the shop first, followed by Hadoumi, while Anas waited outside, their movements confirmed by an eyewitness who later spoke to the police. Then after the woman went outside briefly and back in, Anas followed too pulling the shutter down behind him. Over 20 minutes passed before the trio exited the shop. Since there were no cameras inside, what happened inside the shop could only be gauged through statements subsequently made by the accused to the police, explained Pawney. “None of them denied their presence inside,” said the inspector, adding that the only divergence was about who dealt the blows to the shopowner and the lingering doubt as to whether all three did. While Anas and Borg Sciberras pointed at Hadoumi, Hadoumi pointed at Anas, the witness said. Following the violent robbery, the suspects walked out of the shop pulling down the shutter and walked to Blue Grotto Avenue where they left in a taxi.  No one entered the shop from the time the accused left until the owner’s son arrived on site. The door had somehow locked itself and was opened when civil protection officers were called in. The visual report included stills of the victim as he lay unconscious on the floor and a last image of the ambulance rushing him to hospital. The case before Magistrate Ian Farrugia continues. AG lawyers Anthony Vella and Kaylie Bonett, together with Inspectors Shaun Pawney, Lydon Zammit, Jonathan Cassar and Stephen Gulia prosecuted. Lawyers Mark Mifsud Cutajar, Brandon Muscat and Maria Karlsson are legal aid counsel. Lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell appeared parte civile.

Homeless man who slept on scaffolding says he broke church window by accident,Edwina Brincat,"A man charged with attempted theft said he accidentally broke a church window while sleeping on scaffolding set up three-storeys high against the Holy Trinity Church in Marsa. He told court he never meant to break in.  Hossam Amgad Anwar Aly Elnily, a 26-year-old Maltese national, said he was currently homeless.  Dressed all in black, with paint-stained pants and shoes, he pleaded not guilty to attempted theft and wilful damage to third-party property.  He was arrested on Wednesday evening sometime after 8.30pm by Marsa police who were alerted to the site when people heard a loud bang and the sound of shattered glass, explained prosecuting Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa.  Police officers spotted the accused on the third storey of the scaffolding set up in preparation for restoration works. He was called down and the parish priest, together with the church sacristan let the police officers into the church to determine the source of that shattering sound.  That sound was traced to a large window leading to the church organ, high above the aisles. The pane was broken at the centre and it seemed rather unlikely that the damage had been caused accidentally, said the prosecutor.  The suspect was subsequently questioned.  He insisted that he had been sleeping on that scaffolding for the past days so as to be ready for work in the morning.  The youth told police that he was doing plastering works on the church façade.  But when police checked that information with church officials, they were told that no works had yet begun.  Only the scaffolding had been set up and it had to be certified before the project could get underway.  Moreover, police later found the suspect’s bag of possessions, namely his clothes and documents, at nearby public toilets.  The man’s defence lawyer contested the validity of the arrest, but after hearing the prosecution’s explanation, the court confirmed its validity. Legal aid lawyer Martin Fenech requested bail, arguing that the prosecution had produced no evidence to rebut the accused’s statement that he had been working at the church.  Next week, the accused was due to get a place at a shelter, added the defence.  But AG lawyer Tilden Tabone countered that the accused had no fixed address and was not trustworthy.  He had been previously convicted over several thefts from churches.  After hearing submissions Magistrate Abigail Critien turned down the request since the accused had no fixed address.

"Murder suspect had rights breached by legal shortcoming, court says",Edwina Brincat,"A murder suspect's right to a fair hearing was breached when he ended up in more than 30 days of legal limbo, unable to challenge his state of arrest while his case changed hands from one judge to another, a court has declared. The facts surrounding the case emerged some months ago when lawyers for Aleksandr Stojanovic, a 43-year-old Serb currently awaiting trial for a murder that took place in Gozo five years ago, first flagged the accused's plight before the criminal courts. Stojanovic stands accused of the murder of Egyptian Walid Salah Abdel Motaleb Mohammed. The bill of indictment was presented by the Attorney General in November 2022. The accused's lawyers filed several requests for bail but all were turned down, mainly because the courts deemed Stojanovic untrustworthy. The accused had fled from Serbia where he was wanted to serve a term of imprisonment of three and a half years. But following the filing of the bill of indictment, his case changed hands some four times as one judge after another abstained. The accused’s lawyers filed a request for bail and after over a month without any news, they filed a second request, then sought to jolt the courts into action by seeking a special procedure whereby the defence may challenge the legality of the arrest. However, that challenge also failed since the Criminal Court observed that the law did not allow the procedure once the bill of indictment had been issued. That ruling brought to the fore the anomalous scenario currently existing under Maltese law and prompted Stojanovic to seek recourse before the constitutional courts. His lawyers argued that the fact that the law did not allow the habeas corpus remedy to those issued with a bill of indictment, breached the accused’s right to a fair hearing. Their argument was upheld on Thursday by the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, flagging this shortcoming and calling upon the legislator to effect the necessary amendments. “This court cannot understand what makes the freedom of a person less important and less fundamental once the bill of indictment has been issued,” Madam Justice Joanne Vella Cuschieri observed. Whilst declaring that Stojanovic’s right to a fair hearing had been breached, the judge rejected his request for immediate release. The court observed that when Stojanovic’s bail request was finally heard before the Criminal Court after over 30 days of legal limbo, it was ultimately turned down. So even if it were heard earlier, the outcome would have been the same, added the judge. However, although as argued by the Attorney General and State Advocate, this was a “truly exceptional” case, it was nonetheless an eye-opener for the legislator that such a remedy ought to apply even when the bill of indictment had been issued. Such remedy should apply throughout the whole course of the criminal proceedings, the judge declared. The court awarded Stojanovic €500 by way of compensation and ordered that a copy of the judgment be sent to the Speaker of House of Representatives once it became final.

Father in France confesses to killing three daughters,AFP,"A father in France on Sunday confessed to killing his three young daughters and turned himself in, said prosecutors and a police source. The man, 41, went to the police station in the northern coastal town of Dieppe ""to report that he had killed his three children"", the local public prosecutor said. Police found them dead in his home in the town of Alfortville, in the southeastern suburbs of Paris. The public prosecutor in the Paris suburb of Creteil confirmed the ""deaths of three young girls aged four, 10 and 11"". Two children were stabbed to death, said a police source. They were found under a cover, while the third lay dead on a sofa, according to early findings of the investigation. The father had been convicted of domestic violence in 2021, said a source close to the case. A restraining order against him was issued but subsequently lifted.  The man was taken into police custody, the prosecutors said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Editorial: An anniversary of shame,Times of Malta,"This week marked the one-year anniversary since the femicide of mother-of-two Bernice Cassar, who was shot dead on her way to work. Bernice’s estranged husband allegedly held a knife to her throat in May 2022 – an incident that led her to leave her matrimonial home with her two children. She managed to get a protection order which he allegedly breached. That was before she was stopped in her tracks as she drove to work and was gunned down in the middle of the road. Last week, her four siblings broke a year-long silence and spoke about the way she lived the last nine days of her life in fear – begging the authorities to protect her. Her two brothers and two sisters also questioned what happened to the recommendations drawn up as part of the inquiry that concluded that the state ‘system’ failed Bernice. Soon after they spoke up, the government called a press conference in which it announced that 70 per cent of the recommendations were fulfilled and the rest would soon be implemented. The government said the definition of domestic violence will be amended to be tightened, since its current one is too broad and is overloading the system. We heard there are 2,283 domestic violence cases pending before the two magistrates assigned to handle such cases.   We heard that, in line with the recommendations, there are 25 new police officers added to the Domestic Violence Unit. And, as from January, ‘special time’ will be allocated in court to analyse more urgent domestic violence cases. We were also told that the much-criticised risk assessment tool – which failed to see the high risk Bernice was in – is being changed; and that domestic violence hubs will be open where people can file domestic violence reports, that currently all go through police headquarters. While there have been positive changes, gaps remain; like the fact that the fears of victims are being overlooked by the ‘system’. The court delays are blind to the real fears of victims and their families who long for peace of mind and closure. European Parliament President Ro­ber­ta Metsola recently called for proper protection frameworks. “We need more convictions of those who prey on females. And we need to end the remaining institutional blindness to this epidemic upon women. There are no more excuses. It is already too late,” she said. For Bernice it is too late. It was good to hear Prime Minister Robert Abela publicly apologising on behalf of the State for “systematic shortcomings”. Bernice’s family said the change is not happening fast enough and organised a remembrance gathering to get their messages across on the anniversary of the murder. Last week, we heard of a particular victim who filed a domestic violence report with the police in October, only to receive a summons to appear in court in January 2025. In short, the backlog that existed before Bernice was killed remains. If we have learnt anything from Bernice’s tragic story, it’s that immediate action is needed. This month, Bernice was meant to be standing in court and testifying against someone who allegedly attacked her. Instead, she is buried in a cemetery where her children visit regularly and place the crafts they made at school on her grave. The worst part of it all was that she saw it coming. But those who could protect her did not treat it with the urgency needed. They asked her to wait. But she ran out of time.

When only yes means yes,| Helena Dalli,"“Careful if you are going out jogging by yourself.” “If you don’t want to attract unwanted attention, don’t put that skirt on.” “Don’t drink.” “Don’t stay out late. Who is taking you back home?” “Don’t walk alone after dark, it is dangerous.” If this does not sound familiar to you, most probably, you are not a woman. This is because us women are repeatedly faced with similar fear-inducing warnings placing the responsibility of our safety solely on us; so much so that these phrases become part of our shared experience as women. Over my years of political engagement, I met several survivors of sexual violence, including rape, who confided in me. Some women I met were coerced into the sexual act against their will but did not put up a fight against their aggressors in their particular circumstances. These encounters show the complex dynamics of coercion and how rape and sexual violence often occur within the context of a power imbalance. In Malta, the latest data from Eurostat reports 28 women victims of rape in 2021, which is the highest since 2019. To address this scourge in Malta as in the rest of the EU, in 2022, the European Commission proposed a directive to combat violence against women and domestic violence. The proposal enhances victim support and access to justice through tailored protection, support services, emergency measures and compensation claims. Additionally, it requires adequate prevention efforts and professional training, coupled with improved data collection. The proposal makes clear that rape is one of the most serious offences breaching a person’s sexual integrity and is a crime that disproportionately affects women. In Article 5, it defines rape as penetrative sex performed without consent, with a body part or an object. The consent that is required according to this proposal refers to an agreement that is freely given. It is not to be assumed from a lack of verbal or physical resistance or from the context of past intimate relations. Thus, consent must be clearly expressed and may be retracted at any moment. Conversely, the absence of consent is not only a ‘no’ or silence but any circumstance where an individual is coerced, pressured or intimidated into sexual activity. This distinction is not a formality; it is an essential prerequisite as the answer to this question clearly distinguishes between consensual sexual relations and rape.   Data shows that, in those member states where rape is defined in terms of an absence of consent, reports indicate an increase in the number of rape cases filed. This rise is linked to heightened public awareness of the improved legal definition of rape and an increase in trust in the legal system’s readiness to address such claims. Article 5 is, therefore, a beacon of empowerment for women as it shifts the discourse from questioning the victim’s behaviour to affirming the principle that only ‘yes’ means ‘yes’. By legislating on this basis, we do not only uphold the intrinsic value of individual will but also craft a legal shield that protects all women, asserting with unwavering clarity that unconsented sexual acts constitute rape. I hold firm on the belief that the EU needs to adopt Article 5 and call for a unified definition of rape based on the lack of freely given consent. We would be negligent not to ensure that all women living in the European Union are offered the same level of legal protection. I augur that the Council will come to agree on the urgency to take a step in this direction and share the commission’s perspective on this important definition. I expect that it agrees to establish that all sexual intercourse without consent is rape.   This is a decisive step toward a justice system that fully protects potential victims and supports all survivors; building a society that unequivocally respects personal boundaries and integrity.

Suspect held in Spain over 'attempted terrorist assassination',Times of Malta,"A suspect has been remanded in custody for the ""attempted terrorist assassination"" of a co-founder of Spain's far-right Vox party, the High Court in Madrid announced Friday. Alejo Vidal-Quadras, a former leader of Spain's main right-wing political party in Catalonia who went on to co-found Vox, was shot in the head in Madrid earlier this month. ""The judge has decided to remand the detainee in Lanjaron"", in the south of Spain, ""in custody for the offence of attempted terrorist assassination"", the court said in a statement. His girlfriend, arrested with him on Monday in Lanjaron, has been released on parole, as has a third suspect, arrested on Monday in the southern city of Malaga. The three suspects are not ""the direct perpetrators"" of the crime, the police said in a statement. The main suspect, accused of shooting the politician, is still being sought by the police, who have identified him as a ""Frenchman of Tunisian origin with several previous convictions in France, his country of residence"". The three other suspects, one British and the others Spanish, are suspected of having provided logistical assistance, said police. Vidal-Quadras was leader of the conservative PP party in the northeastern Catalonia region in the 1990s. He went on to be an MEP and then was among the founders of Vox, which he left shortly after its creation.  Following the shooting on November 9, he was taken to Madrid's Gregorio Maranon hospital, which said in a statement on Thursday that he would be discharged after suffering a double fracture of the jaw. Vidal-Quadras, who is close to the exiled Iranian opposition, has accused the leaders in Tehran of being behind the assassination attempt, according to those close to him.

Toy thief whose life is 'overtaken' by drugs jailed for two-and-a-half years,Edwina Brincat,"A man, who was manifestly reluctant to quit his drug habit, was jailed for his involvement in a series of thefts from a toy manufacturing factory four years ago. Robert Borg, a 50-year-old Tarxien resident, was identified through CCTV footage as one of two suspects who entered the factory premises at Bulebel industrial estate on a number of occasions between June and July 2019, nicking toys stacked in a box truck, all ready for next morning’s delivery.  Company employees carried out two daily deliveries to local businesses, at 6 am and 4 pm. One of the directors smelled a rat when discrepancies were flagged between a consignment delivered on June 2 and the items listed in the delivery note.  After checking CCTV footage from the factory’s outer yard, his suspicions were confirmed. The footage showed two people arriving on site in a red Maruti 800 and parking close to one of the company trucks.  While one of the men entered the truck through a slit in the canvas covering the box, his accomplice waited outside, ready to take the boxes handed to him from inside the truck.  The director later identified Borg as the one who entered the truck.  A copy of that footage was handed over to the police.  The company also confirmed that the canvas cover of the truck had been ripped to let the thief through, resulting in damages that cost €2950 plus VAT to repair.  Following that first incident, similar episodes followed and each time, the directors checked the footage confirming the same sequence of events.  The thefts always took place between 4 pm and 8 pm. Factory workers who went out for their break at 6 pm sometimes found boxes missing from the yard and on one occasion, merchandise went missing from the production line. The police were asked to keep watch at the factory.  On July 7, all was quiet while police surveilled the premises. But minutes after they left, the thieves struck again. The next day, police set up watch again and caught the two suspects in the act.  Both were prosecuted for aggravated theft and the final failed attempt, as well as for wilful damage to third-party property.  Borg’s accomplice was found guilty earlier on and was handed a 3-year probation order.  When delivering judgment against Borg this week the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that there was evidence linking him to four of the thefts and the last botched attempt. The court itself, after closely examining the footage, could identify the accused as the suspect who ripped the truck’s canvas with some sharp instrument, widened the slit and went through it into the truck.  He then handed out boxes to his accomplice. The accused was also identified as the suspect who entered the factory on June 27, stealing two boxes of ‘Lucky Dip’ merchandise.  He was also identified by the policemen who caught both suspects red-handed.  Borg had also admitted in his police statement that he went to the factory with his friend to collect toy parts, bags and boxes left outside in the yard.  He would then put those parts together and sell the finished products to third parties.  The total value of those thefts amounted to €2824, said the court, observing that the prosecution had not sufficiently proved his involvement in four other thefts.  The charge of recidivism was not proved because his 2008 conviction had resulted in a conditional discharge and although his criminal record indicated other convictions, no authenticated copies of those judgments were produced in evidence.  However, his “unruly” record was taken into consideration when meting out punishment. Borg was gripped “in an absolute manner” by a drug addiction he could not overcome, perhaps because he lacked the will to do so.  When placed under a temporary supervision order by the courts, he failed to abide by its terms. His probation officer testified that “he was not fit for supervision” and that the order was revoked.  While detained at Corradino Correctional Facility, he was offered assistance but did not show interest in the care plan tailored to his needs.  In fact, he had said that he would follow that plan only so as to get bail.  Once granted bail, he failed to keep in touch with his probation officer or Caritas Outreach officials to prepare himself to enter rehab.  Faced with such circumstances, the court had no alternative but to condemn the accused to effective imprisonment. Drugs had completely taken over his life and he lacked motivation to address the problem, observed Magistrate Montebello.  Until he did so, the accused could not be trusted in society. The court thus condemned him to two and a half years imprisonment and placed him under a 4-year treatment order.  He was to reimburse the company €5491 within eight months and was to cover €399 in court expert expenses. Inspector Roderick Attard prosecuted.

‘Lost diamonds’: Rare Russian books stolen from European libraries,AFP,"A spate of thefts of rare Russian classics worth millions of euros from libraries across Eastern Europe has left a trail that points all the way to auctions in Russia. Shelves of 19th-century Russian literature have been ransacked over the past two years in Poland and the Baltic states, with originals replaced by fakes. The University of Warsaw library only found out last month about the thefts, including first editions of works by Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol. A university employee with knowledge of the matter estimated the value of the stolen books at “around a million euros”.   “It was like gouging out the crown jewels,” Hieronim Grala, a former diplomat, an expert in Russia policy and professor at the University of Warsaw told AFP. “Fortunately, not everything was picked out, but a few emeralds, diamonds and rubies are lost,” said Grala, who has helped the university assess the damages. The theft in Warsaw was not an isolated event. Libraries in the three Baltic countries have also fallen prey to thieves, and in each case Russian literature was targeted. Experts believe the stolen works have found their way to Russia, with at least some sold off at hasty auctions in Moscow. ‘Industrial scale’ The first known case of what turned out to be a series of similar raids was detected at the National Library of Latvia last year, when three books were stolen. A Georgian citizen was later found guilty of stealing them and sentenced to six months in prison, but his accomplice remained at large. In the same month, two men claiming to be studying censorship and printing policy in early 19th-century Russia showed up at the university library in the Estonian city of Tartu and asked for the nearly 200-year-old works of Pushkin and Gogol. It was only four months later that the library realised they had left behind eight convincing-looking copies, not the books that were later estimated to be worth a total of 158,000 euros ($170,000). In May, Lithuania’s Vilnius University library discovered 17 of its rare Russian books had gone missing too. “Most of the stolen books were replaced with non-original ones,” Gintare Vitkauskaite-Satkauskiene, spokeswoman of the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s Office, told AFP. According to Lithuanian investigators, the stolen books were worth around 440,000 euros.   The University of Warsaw has so far identified 79 books as missing, meaning it suffered the most substantial losses of all four countries. “Here, the thieves operated on an industrial scale,” a Warsaw University library employee who declined to be named, told AFP. “When I saw what they had taken, I felt a hot flash.” The fake books the thieves left behind, seen by AFP, range from sloppy imitations to meticulous counterfeits, where only the improper stamp ink colour or size of label revealed the forgery. While these books were being counted as still in the collection, the originals were being sold off in Moscow. “There’s a memo dated December 22, 2022, that the books are in their place,” Grala told AFP. “On the same day, at an auction in Moscow, one of these books goes for 30,500 euros.” ‘Organised from Russia’ Sources close to the Warsaw library’s investigation have shown AFP screenshots of auctions held by Russia’s Litfond auction house with books carrying stamps and catalogue numbers of Warsaw University. “It is clear to me that the whole action was centrally organised from Russia,” Grala told AFP. AFP contacted the Litfond auction house but its general director Sergei Burmistrov did not explicitly deny nor confirm any wrongdoing. “The Litfond auction house works within the framework of the current legislation of the Russian Federation, and we do not accept for sale nor do we sell any books with stamps from existing state libraries”, Burmistrov said. To Grala, there is a clear Russian link connecting the thefts in Poland and the Baltic countries which is hardly a surprise or coincidence.   “The first three strikes hit those countries that the Russians accuse of fighting the Russian language and Russian culture,” he told AFP. “They recognised quite well that the Rossica (items related to Russian culture) are guarded less strictly in our region... and less guarded means more accessible.” Poland’s relations with Russia have long been strained, with Warsaw being an ardent critic of the Kremlin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both sides frequently trade barbs about protecting each other’s cultural heritage. Grala could barely hide his emotion as he spoke of how he was “devastated” by the “irreversible” losses of Russian books that survived two national uprisings and two world wars on Polish soil. “The librarians of the University of Warsaw, risking their lives during the war, secretly built a double ceiling and hid the books so that they wouldn’t disappear or burn down,” Grala told AFP. “And we couldn’t protect them from looting.”   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Drug trafficker who set fire to Gżira flat while tenant was inside gets 13 years,Edwina Brincat,"A drug trafficker who set fire to a Gżira apartment while its occupant was inside has been jailed for 13 years and fined €25,000. Justin Dimech, 32 and from Gżira, broke into the seafront apartment at 7.30am, poured fuel beneath a bathroom door that the tenant was cowering behind and then set the place ablaze. The tenant managed to escape through a window and down a shaft. He was arrested after the victim, a 36-year-old man, reported the crime to the police and charged with attempted murder, wilfully setting fire to the apartment and wilful damage to third-party property. He was also charged with selling or otherwise trafficking cannabis and ecstasy, possessing the drugs under circumstances denoting that they were not solely for personal use as well as unlawful possession of cocaine. Dimech initially pleaded not guilty but switched that plea to an admission on July 31, 2023. The records of the case were then sent to the Criminal Court since the offences carried a punishment exceeding 12 years imprisonment. On October 31, the Attorney General and the defence filed a joint note declaring that they had reached agreement on the punishment to be imposed upon the accused. They requested the court to condemn Dimech to a 13-year prison sentence and a €23,000 fine, together with confiscation of all his assets. A scientific expert was appointed to examine the suspected illegal substances found in the accused’s possession. The expert confirmed that the suspected drugs consisted of 75 grams of cannabinol (CBN), 40 grams of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) having 17% purity and another 311 grams with 11% purity. There were also 72 pink ecstasy pills. The apartment suffered €1882 in damages in the arson attack. In light of such considerations the Criminal Court, presided over by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera, upheld the joint request and condemned the accused to a 13-year jail term and a €25,000 fine.  Dimech was also ordered to pay €7571.67 in court expert expenses within one year and to reimburse the victim €1882 plus VAT for the damages suffered to the property. The court also ordered that all assets of the accused, subjected to a freezing order upon arraignment, were to be confiscated in favour of the state. The drugs seized were to be destroyed unless the Attorney General requested otherwise. Upon admission “as a general rule” the accused should benefit from some reduction in punishment, observed the judge when delivering judgment. However, each case had its own particular characteristics. One factor to be considered by the court was whether the accused’s admission allowed the case to be decided as soon as possible, thus sparing useless waste of time and unnecessary expenses for the state coffers. AG lawyer Anthony Vella, together with Inspectors Shaun Pawney and Jonathan Ransley prosecuted. Lawyer Noel Bianco was defence counsel. Lawyer Charles Mercieca assisted the victim.

Binance founder agrees to plead guilty to money laundering,AFP,"Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, is expected to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion (€3.9 billion) and its chief is planning to step down, a US media report said Tuesday. In a deal with US authorities that could allow the company to keep running, Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao intends to plead guilty to violating US anti-money laundering rules and leave his position, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. The agreement would end most of the investigations into Binance, which was created in 2017 and cornered much of the crypto-trading market, turning Zhao into a billionaire. Binance runs crypto exchanges and provides other services across the world, but it has taken a severe hit since crypto markets collapsed and regulators began probing the legality of its business. Zhao, who has often been presented as the archrival of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was due in court Tuesday to enter his plea, the Journal report added. The agreement with authorities would also let Zhao keep his majority ownership in Binance.  He is expected to face sentencing at a later time. For now, executives have left the company and it has laid off staff this year as it grappled with probes in the United States. The Justice Department, whose investigation looked into Binance's program to find and prevent money laundering, declined to comment. The Journal added that the Justice Department had also looked into whether Binance allowed people in sanctioned countries -- such as Iran and Russia -- to trade with Americans. Binance did not respond to media queries on the matter. The $4.3 billion in fines reportedly include sums to address a civil lawsuit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and claims leveled by the Treasury Department's agencies. But this deal does not include a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), another regulator. The SEC pressed a raft of charges against Binance in June, saying it allowed US residents to trade even when it was not registered in the country as a securities exchange. The case also alleged the firm misused customer funds. While Binance was founded in China, Zhao moved its operations to other locations internationally after a crackdown on the crypto sector by Beijing. The volatile industry surged in 2021 with a range of complex products and celebrity endorsements propelling it to a valuation in excess of $3 trillion last year. But a series of scandals including the collapse of the FTX exchange and criminal charges for its executives saw public confidence evaporate and investors pull their money out. In July 2021, the Malta Financial Services Authority warned that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume is not authorised to operate under Maltese law. It had issued a similar notice in February 2020. Back in 2018, Binance served as the jewel in the government’s push for Malta to be crowned the world’s ""Blockchain Island"". It had received a welcome by then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who said at the time that Malta wanted to be “the global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses”.   .

Legal definition of 'domestic violence' to be updated,Giulia Magri,"The government will next year present a bill to amend the definition of domestic violence in the law to make it less broad, the Domestic Violence Commissioner said on Tuesday evening.  Updating the definition is one of the recommendations made by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia in the inquiry into the femicide of Bernice Cassar.  The inquiry concluded that the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother-of-two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.  Cassar was murdered while driving to work. Her estranged husband Roderick Cassar has been charged with the femicide and is pleading not guilty. Samantha Pace Gasan was speaking to journalists on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the murder of Cassar.  Alongside Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Parliamentary Secretary for Equality and Reforms Rebecca Buttigieg, Pace Gasan gave details on the progress and work on improving the current systems to fight against domestic violence and taking on the inquiry’s recommendations.  One of Valenzia's recommendations is to update the definition of domestic violence in the law since it is too broad and leads to a caseload increase. Currently, violence committed by anyone living in the same home, including flatmates, is considered a case of domestic violence.  Pace Gasan said that a bill to update the law would be submitted to parliament and that discussions among stakeholders would take place to ensure the definition is correct and leaves no victims out.   RELATED STORIES  On his part, Minister Camilleri said that more than 70 percent of the recommendations that emerged from the inquiry have been implemented.  “A  number of recommendations have been implemented this year, others are in the process of being implemented. It is a priority that not one recommendation is left out,” he said. One of the recommendations was to increase resources within the police’s domestic violence unit.  While Pace Gasan said the shortage of human resources is a constant issue faced, she said that in recent months 25 officers joined the police Domestic Violence Unit.  Now there are more than 60 people in the department.  From January, ‘special time’ will be allocated in court to analyse more urgent domestic violence cases.  The inquiry also pointed out that the risk assessment tools used to determine the level of danger a particular domestic violence victim faces must be fixed or changed.  The tool, known as the DASH system- Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification – has faced criticism ever since it was introduced in Malta in 2018.  Pace Gasan said last month that studies to change the risk assessment tool were concluded and that the Danger Assessment (DA) tool will be implemented. She said the tool is currently being adapted to suit the Maltese situation.  She said there are now two magistrates focusing on domestic violence cases, and that a new specialised team dedicated to evaluating high-risk domestic violence cases has been set up earlier this year.  Regarding establishing domestic violence hubs with teams specialising in the field, the commissioner said that the Santa Luċija hub will be operating by the end of the year.  Another hub in Mtarfa will be operating next year.  Camilleri clarified that the domestic violence hubs will allow the unit to move out of the police headquarters and operate from the centre. The alleged aggressors will not be allowed into the hubs, but only victims and children.  He also said that the government will provide wearable panic alarms for victims of domestic violence. Once pressed, the panic alarm will call 112 and automatically give the person’s location to emergency services. Electronic tagging will be introduced next year. In the coming days, the third strategy on domestic violence and gender-based violence will be launched, which will be a ‘roadmap’ for the next five years on how to tackle domestic violence.  Regarding a new law allowing people to check whether their partner has a history of domestic violence, Pace Gasan said the Victim Support Agency recorded seven requests.

Let's do everything possible to prevent violence against women - Roberta Metsola,Times of Malta,"European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Monday called for “proper protection frameworks” as she spoke about violence against women during Monday’s parliamentary sitting. Speaking on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Metsola called for commitment to “do everything possible to prevent violence against women and girls in Europe and beyond”.   Metsola referred to Bernice Cassar and Paulina Dembska’s murders in Malta, along with those of Giulia Cecchettin, Ashling Murphy and others giving them as “examples of abuse and murder of women in Europe... simply for being women. It is appalling. It is terrible. And it is completely unacceptable.” She said: “We need proper protection frameworks. We need more convictions of those who prey on females. And we need to end the remaining institutional blindness to this epidemic upon women. There are no more excuses. It is already too late.” Metsola said that nowords of comfort can ever bring a mother, a daughter, or a sister back. But justice and accountability were small steps for those they leave behind. “We must do more for women.”   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

‘We want to know that our sister has not died in vain’,Claudia Calleja,"One year after the state failed to protect femicide victim Bernice Cassar, her family have yet to receive an apology for the various shortcomings that left her two children motherless. Speaking up for the first time since the murder, Bernice’s two brothers and two sisters came together to voice the family’s disappointment. They also spoke about how life has been since November 22, 2022, when their eldest sister was shot dead on her way to work. Her estranged husband, Roderick Cassar, has been charged with the femicide and is pleading not guilty. “Our sister exposed every single loophole in the system. She was begging the authorities to protect her, but no one listened. We can’t believe they did not see the risk that was so obvious to anyone around her,” said her sister Alessia Cilia Portelli. Bernice had filed multiple police reports against her ex-husband before she was shot dead. Days before she was killed, her lawyer pleaded with police to take action against her ex-husband for breaching a protection order.    An inquiry concluded that the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother-of-two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload. The inquiry went on to make a number of recommendations that include increasing resources and strengthening protection orders. A copy of the recommendations was given to the family’s lawyers just a few hours before the press conference was announced.  RELATED STORIES  “No one has kept us informed about what happened to those recommendations,” said her brother Peter Cilia. “We can’t bring our sister back. But we want to know she did not die in vain. That at least this will not happen again. They said the system failed her. But what about the people in that system? Has something been done?” he said while acknowledging that, since his sister’s murder, police did take reports more seriously. The last photo The four siblings – Alessia, Peter, Clarice Micallef Cilia and Karsten Cilia Zarb – sit around the dining table at Karsten’s house. It was the last place they were together as a family, a Halloween costume party for the children two weeks before the murder. That day Bernice looked happy. “My well became famous. Bernice wanted to take a new profile photo,” Karsten says sombrely as he points towards a stone well in the hallway of his home. The scene is familiar. It is the backdrop to the photo of Bernice used in the media following the murder.   Alessia continues: “It was her homework from the therapist. Her old profile picture was with the kids and the therapist was working on helping her to accept that she was more than a mother – she was a woman. That day she was determined to take the photo.” Alessia has other versions of the photo taken with her mobile phone. “Now that photo is on her grave,” Karsten says poignantly. It remained a symbol of Bernice trying to claim her independence.   “That day we remember her happy. After that, the last nine days of her life were hard and filled with suffering. “The timeline is known and we won’t go into it. But in those nine days she was fighting for her life. She filed a report and knew there was a protection order. She noticed that the protection order was just a piece of paper with no value. She felt alone. She was scared. This is something we are angry about,” Alessia says. Living with loss “We, her family, are carrying the weight of all this. Her children especially,” she adds. “The pain is shared, but from a different perspective. Our parents’ loss is one thing and that of her children is the hardest. “You learn to live differently. The pain is there. Not a day passes without it. There are moments when you feel happy – like when Clarice got married – but there is a bittersweet feeling that is with you all day,” Alessia says. She recalls that, the night before the murder, she was on the phone with Bernice. “She was washing the children and crying a lot. She was feeling helpless and did not like living in fear. She was worried about the safety of her children too… The last thing she did was kiss the kids and see them onto the school van. Then she drove towards her death.”   Clarice recalls the morning of the murder. “Bernice’s daughter was going to be Our Lady in the school pageant and Bernice needed to pick up a costume from Birkirkara that day. She was busy so I offered to go. After what happened I ended up not going… After that, her daughter did not want to be Our Lady. She wanted to be an angel – like her mother had become.” As she wipes her tears, she says this year has been a difficult one for everyone.  The children are aware of what happened. On the day of the murder they were informed by their school therapists and other professionals, with a family member to provide support in such a sensitive and difficult situation. Hoping for closure Alessia, Peter, Karsten and Clarice have now stepped in to share the parenting role. The children, now age nine and six, live with their grandparents – where they were already living before the murder as Bernice had left the matrimonial home some months earlier. Their aunties and uncles chip in to take them to extracurricular activities, help with the homework, take them to school parties and to therapy.   “They are happy children,” Alessia says. Then she stops. “No words seem right. ‘Happy’ in the sense that they have all the material things they need and are surrounded by love. They smile and they are doing well at school. But they miss their mother. They visit her at the cemetery and take her the pictures and crafts they make for her.” The siblings, and other family members, also make sure someone is always present during the court proceedings. The compilation of evidence is reaching its final stages. While they understand that the court system needs to take time, they hope for closure. “We want justice – holistically. Those who failed our sister should take responsibility. We want to live in peace knowing that we and the children are safe,” they say. They are now preparing for Christmas. “Last Christmas was too close to the case. We can’t use it as a gauge to how this one will be. Bernice loved Christmas. After she died, she received a parcel at work. She had bought our Christmas presents,” says Alessia. Clarice, emotional, adds: “We had to figure out whose was whose. They were our birth stones. We treasure the last gift she gave us – after she died.” The family is organising a tribute gathering called Echoes of Silence in remembrance of Bernice Cassar on November 22 at Triq il-Baċir, Paola, from 7.30am to 8.30am: one year to the date and place of her murder.

Copper cable thieves caught red-handed after leaving hundreds with no internet,Times of Malta,"A Marsascala man was caught red-handed attempting to steal underground copper cables in the early hours of Saturday morning, with police also arresting two suspected accomplices. The suspects are believed to have cut through a fibre optic cable in their attempt to steal the copper, cutting off internet connectivity for GO Internet customers in Valletta and Floriana in the process. Police said in a statement that they were called to an area close to Argotti Gardens at around 4am after receiving a report about an attempted theft of copper cables. Officers entered tunnels in the area and spotted a man, who is 39 and from Marsascala, carrying copper cables. He tried to hide but eventually emerged and gave himself up. The police officers continued to search inside the tunnels and eventually came across two other men hiding: a 30-year-old Żejtun man and a 35-year-old Nigerian national. All three were arrested and taken to the Valletta police station for further questioning. They are likely to be arraigned later on Saturday. The attempted robbery had a knock-on effect on hundreds of residents, with GO customers in Valletta and Floriana left without internet as a result. In a company statement, GO said that its technicians had been onsite since 2am and had alerted the police after discovering the cut cable. Technicians could only begin work to repair the cable once police forensic teams had completed their assessments. ‘It is extremely disappointing and disheartening that such incidents keep on occurring. This is not the first time that our services have been impacted due to theft attempts. These individuals do not realise that they are tampering with critical infrastructure that supports civil protection units and other services, on which the country and its people depend,’ a GO spokesperson said. The spokesperson asked for customers’ patience and understanding while technicians worked to restore service. “Our teams are on site and are doing everything they possibly can to restore the services in as short as time as is reasonably possible. Services will start to be restored in the coming hours.”   ""It is also extremely frustrating for us too since our resources need to be reallocated to fixing this unanticipated and deliberate damage instead of focusing our efforts on servicing our customers, and the country, not to mention the significant costs to repair which could have been invested elsewhere,"" the spokesperson said.

Sweden's Supreme Court throws out 'vagina' ruling,AFP,"Warning: Graphic content Sweden's Supreme Court on Friday threw out an appeals court ruling acquitting a man of raping a 10-year-old girl because it had been unsure what the word she used for her vagina meant. The girl had used the word ""snippa"", devised by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) in the early 2000s and introduced in preschools as a neutral and informal term to destigmatise women's genitals. It is intended to be the female equivalent of the existing and commonly-used word ""snopp"" for male genitalia, and has rapidly grown in usage since its introduction. In June 2021, the Halmstad district court in southwestern Sweden convicted the man, who is in his 50s but has not been publicly named, of rape for putting his hand inside the girl's pants and touching her vagina. But a panel of appeals court judges overturned the ruling in February 2023, saying they could not conclude with certainty what the girl was referring to because she used the word ""snippa"". The dictionary defines ""snippa"" as the outer part of female genitalia but in common usage it refers to the entire vagina, not just the vulva. Despite the girl testifying that the man's fingers had been ""inside"" her ""snippa"", the appeals court also said it could not conclude that the man had penetrated her vagina because of the use of the word ""snippa"". Penetration is required for a rape conviction. The appeals court ruling caused an uproar among legal experts, health authorities and the public, prompting several demonstrations across Sweden, with the hashtag #jagvetvadensnippaar (""I know what a snippa is"") going viral on social media. The Supreme Court ordered a new panel of appeals court judges to retry the case. ""The court is not bound by the criminal classifications presented by the prosecutor but by the prosecutor's description of the act,"" the Supreme Court said. ""In the snippa case, the Court of Appeal found it was proven that the man had touched the girl's sexual organs, and the court should therefore have looked at alternative classifications,"" it said. ""It must have been clear to the Court of Appeal that there was another penalty provision that could have been applicable - sexual abuse of a child,"" wrote Stefan Johansson, one of the judges who participated in the Supreme Court's decision. The girl's mother welcomed the ruling, writing in a text message to Swedish Television: ""A big weight has been lifted."" The ruling was ""important for children's right to the rule of law, and ... for my daughter's emotional well-being and faith in the rule of law"".

'Child soldiers' and blood feuds: Sweden's out-of-control gang wars,AFP,"One night in September, teacher Thomas Cervin was woken by gunshots in his apartment building in Uppsala. His neighbour had just become the latest target in Sweden's terrifying gang wars. Execution-style shootings carried out by ""child soldiers"", apartment buildings rocked by bombings, innocent relatives targeted in vendettas, and the morning news summarising the night's death toll - all have become disturbingly routine in the normally quiet country. ""No other country in Europe is seeing anything like this,"" said Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson as he vowed to defeat the gangs.    ""Swedish legislation was not designed for gang wars and child soldiers. But we're changing that now,"" he said.  Sweden's gang wars have smouldered for a decade over control of the drugs market. But they took a drastic turn early this year when an internal feud led to gang members' families and loved ones also becoming targets. The September 13 shooting in Cervin's building in Uppsala, 70 kilometres north of Stockholm, was aimed at the mother-in-law of Rawa Majid, the ""Kurdish Fox"", and head of the notorious Foxtrot gang. She escaped unharmed.  ""I had no idea she was related to him,"" Cervin said. ""That's what makes so many people scared - the people involved have friends and relatives all over the place."" ""This new generation (of criminals) is ruthless,"" said Garip Gunes, who started a youth football team to keep kids in the disadvantaged Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby out of trouble. ""Many parents are worried about their kids and don't let them go out except to go to school or football practice. They're worried they'll end up in the line of fire,"" he told AFP.  Criminology professor Felipe Estrada Dorner of Stockholm University told AFP the situation ""has gotten totally out of control: they've started attacking loved ones and those who have nothing to do with these conflicts."" ""This is a big change from the violence that has prevailed until now."" Forty-seven people have been killed in 314 shootings so far this year, police said, compared to only seven deaths in 2016. The victims and the perpetrators are increasingly young. Police last year investigated 336 15- to 17-year-olds for having illegal firearms, eight times more than a decade ago, the National Council for Crime Prevention said this month. Gangs now recruit kids to carry out contract killings - some younger than 15 - knowing they can't be jailed. ""Children are contacting criminal gangs"" offering to commit murders, Sweden's police chief Anders Thornberg said. These children ""just don't know how to handle these weapons"", Estrada Dorner said, often leading to innocent bystanders being wounded or killed. In Gottsunda, a suburb near Uppsala, Ebtesam Abowarrad agreed, and said people were scared. ""The difference nowadays is that they shoot all over the place."" ""I never see anyone out in the streets anymore,"" the 40-year-old mother told AFP. Most young gang members have been on social services' radar for years, said Evin Cetin, a former lawyer who has written a book of interviews with young gang members, ""Mitt ibland oss"" (In Our Midst). ""These kids have been trained by criminals -- they live, eat and breathe a culture of violence,"" she said. ""Most of those I've met have an empty look in their eyes, they don't value their own lives."" Prime Minister Kristersson has blamed the rise in organised crime on ""naivety"" over immigration. ""An irresponsible immigration policy and failed integration led us here,"" the conservative leader said. But Cetin argued that the integration problem has a lot to do with the segregation immigrant communities face. ""How is it possible that young Swedes in one of the richest countries in the world have gotten to the point where they're willing to kill, and kill their best friend to boot?"" she asked. ""It says a lot about segregation, the conditions in which they grow up and the exclusion they experience."" Sakariya Hirsi, 26, who hails from Tensta, a heavily-immigrant suburb north of Stockholm, has seen several of his friends die in the violence. In 2020, he founded the Kollektiv Sorg group (Collective Grief) to help families cope with their loss and lobby for change. At a recent meeting of the group at a church in the suburb of Botkyrka, Alexander Zadruzny, 23, said he's ""lost count"" of how many of his friends have died. ""I used to say that our kids grow up too fast, but... our kids don't even live long enough to become adults.""  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Bail for allegedly raping 17-year-old ex-girlfriend, crime filmed on mobile",Edwina Brincat,"A man accused of raping his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend was granted bail on Thursday, along with three other youths accused of attacking the girl's 16-year-old male friend.  A fifth member of the alleged gang had previously admitted to charges of grievously injuring the 16-year-old when he was arraigned in July and sentenced to a one-year jail term suspended for three years.  In July, the prosecution said the two minors had turned up at the police domestic violence unit on a Monday morning, claiming to have been assaulted at the Gianpula nightclub by a gang of Belgian youths the Saturday before. The victims told the police they were then taken to a flat in Sliema where the 17-year-old said she was raped by her ex-boyfriend, 20-year-old Dany Masuekama Kabangu.  In the meantime, in an ordeal that lasted from 5am to 1pm on that Sunday, the boy said he was beaten and assaulted by Kamangu Lema Lelo Arnaud, 18, and Muogo Mukengerwa N’Domba Amani, 20, and two other 17-year-old boys.  All four have pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Proceedings against them continued on Thursday, with Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo upholding a fresh request for bail for all four of the accused.  They were granted bail against a deposit of €15,000, a personal guarantee of €50,000 each as well as daily signing of the bail book and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am. The court previously heard how the girl and her Swiss friend were in Malta studying English, when she was contacted by her ex, whom she had met on the island.  The two had met up in hopes of rekindling their relationship, but the girl broke things off when she learned that Masuekama Kabangu was staying in a flat with four of his friends and his new girlfriend. On that Saturday evening, after a night at the nightclub, he convinced the girl to come back with him to Sliema, with the girl saying she was plied with vodka throughout the taxi ride to his flat.  The next thing she remembered was waking up naked in her ex’s flat to find him raping her.  She also realised that other people in the room were filming the alleged sexual assault.  The girl’s Swiss friend also told police that he was beaten by the Belgians outside Gianpula, who forced him to get into the same taxi with them. He said one of the accused had taken his phone and tried to buy a €2,000 Louis Vuitton bag, giving his Brussels address for its delivery.  Police apprehended the five youths at the airport just an hour before their flight was set to leave Malta, identifying them from photographs sent to them by the victim.  AG lawyers Cynthia Tomasuolo and Joseph Camilleri Azarov are prosecuting together with Inspectors John Spiteri, Omar Zammit and Jonathan Cassar. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, Franco Debono, Stefano Filletti, Jason Azzopardi, Matthew Xuereb and Gianluca Cappitta are defence counsel.

Works to start soon on three new halls for the criminal court,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The Justice Ministry has issued an artist's impression of new halls for the criminal court which will be housed in a renovated building that will also feature administrative offices and a ""protective"" space for victims and their relatives. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard announced on Monday that the three new courtrooms will be housed in the building known as 'Tal-Ferjol', just behind the main courthouse.    The renovated building will also house the criminal court's registry and an ""innovative concept for Malta"" - a specialised zone for victims. ""This area will be only accessible to victims and will have a separate entrance to ensure their best possible protection,"" Attard said.   The €5 million project has been in the pipeline for quite a while. When it was first announced in 2020, then-justice minister Edward Zammit Lewis had promised it would be operational by this year. He had said at the time that the building would be turned into four courtrooms and 25 administrative offices. On Monday Attard acknowledged the project had been touted for several years but he said it could not be completed due to proceedings that had been at an impasse. The impasse has now been broken and a tender for the works will be issued in the coming days. He did not say when the project will be completed.   During the press conference Attard listed measures, initiatives and projects that have been completed or are in the works to mitigate the justice system's increasing challenges caused by staff shortages, the case waiting list and pending magisterial inquiries.   The government, he said, had allocated record funding for the courts and the justice system. With just over €60 million allocated to it, the Justice Ministry would next year see a 21 per cent increase over last year's allocated funds and almost four times the budget allocated to it during the last Nationalist administration in 2013, he said. The aim was to continue the journey towards a more efficient and reliable justice system.   He said a new courtroom in the family court building had been completed and works were underway on new offices and another courtroom for trials by jury. And the court's main entrance would soon house a new help desk. The Court Services Agency would also enjoy a budget that is three times as generous as it had in 2012. Its 500 employees, the highest number ever, are also enjoying better working conditions thanks to a recently signed collective agreement.   The minister also pointed out that judges and magistrates have added help. 29 full-time court attorneys now help them with court processes and the drafting of judgments, and the number of judicial assistants has doubled to 47 since 2012.

Temping agent in Malta charged with conning 280 foreign workers,Edwina Brincat,"A temping agent has been charged in court after allegedly conning about 280 third-country nationals into paying for a work contract in Malta which never materialised. Immigration police pressed charges against Jonathan James Borg, 42, from Balzan as the suspect behind the racket through which the mainly Indian foreign workers entered Malta lured by promises of a job and accommodation. Their hopes vanished once they reached their destination.  Matters came to a head when Borg’s boss at the company where he worked as an accountant began to receive calls from total strangers complaining that he had not kept his promise to provide them with a job and adequate accommodation in Malta. Police investigations revealed that the third-country nationals had arrived in Malta on the strength of false travel and employment documents.  Those documents were traced to Borg.  Each of the migrants allegedly paid some €4,000 only to end up with no job and nowhere to go.  Borg pleaded not guilty to being involved in a human trafficking conspiracy for personal gain, assisting foreign workers to enter Malta in breach of immigration laws, unauthorised use of electronic data, tampering with such data, software or documentation as well as document fraud.  He was also charged with breaching an attachment order issued in terms of anti-money laundering legislation and with allegedly committing these offences while under two suspended sentences handed down in 2019. He was further charged with relapsing.  He pleaded not guilty.  The prosecution objected to a request for bail because civilian witnesses are still to testify and the accused breached previous court orders.  The prosecution also pointed out that tracking down the accused’s address had delayed investigations. In a previous case, Borg had cited his parents’ address.  But it was obvious that he did not live there. His actual address was tracked down by the police through a food delivery app.  Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, turned down the request for bail, deeming the accused not sufficiently trustworthy and also because several witnesses were still to testify.  The court upheld a request for a freezing order over all assets of the accused.  AG lawyer Nathaniel Falzon and Inspector Karl Roberts prosecuted. Lawyer Ezekiel Psaila was defence counsel. Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran and Charles Mercieca are representing the company.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

India police asked to probe seven agencies over fake Malta jobs,Daniel Ellul,"Nine Indian nationals have asked police in Hyderabad to investigate “fraudulent” immigration agencies, including one they claim sends would-be workers to non-existent jobs in Malta. Complainants say the scam even involves forged Maltese notary signatures, but the agent has denied the claims.  RELATED STORIES  Earlier this month, Times of Malta reported how an Indian employment agency called Abroad Study Plan charged people up to €6,000 for a visa, work permit and a promise of a well-paid job in Malta. However, the workers say they were left jobless after arriving in the country.  It transpires that the agency, owned by Anilkumar Ghanta, is one of seven companies listed in a letter handed to Indian police in August. It is signed by people who say they were “cheated” with promises of jobs in European countries by the recruitment agencies. They “provided fake job offer letters, job contracts, notaries”, the letter, dated August 29, reads.    It said that victims had “their own tragic story” including being refused refunds after a visa was rejected or only having a small amount returned. “Sir, in the case of the five per cent of [those who] gained a visa, people [are] also suffering [in] their destination, like not [being provided] accommodation and job. The consultants are not looking after the clients,” the letter said.     “We earnestly request your honour to kindly refund our amount from concerned consultants and take action against scams please.” Times of Malta spoke to one of the letter authors, Srinivasa Rao, who said he worked at Abroad Study Plan’s Delhi office. Rao was in the process of emigrating to Malta before stopping everything after suspecting “fraud” during the 25 days he worked in the office.  RELATED STORIES  When contacted, Anilkumar Ghanta said Rao was allowed to live in the office premises but never worked there. Sai Kiran Pannala was another person who signed the police letter. He said documents needed for his visa process included forged signatures and notary stamps bearing the name of Maltese notary Joanne Cassar. Times of Malta saw a residential lease, an Identity Malta landlord declaration, and a work contract that were seemingly signed and stamped by the Maltese notary. But when contacted and shown pictures of the documents, Cassar said the signature and stamp bearing her name were fake. “My signature and stamp and handwriting look completely different,” she said. She said she had twice been informed about forged documents signed in her name and in both cases had directed the complainants to the police. It is unclear which agency forged Cassar’s signature. Two media organisations in the Indian state of Telangana reported the issue, showing several men holding a large banner saying: “Action should be taken against those who are deceiving Telugu youth in the name of jobs in Europe. Visa fraud should be stopped… A tearful plea for police department”.    The “victims” gathered at the police headquarters and delivered a letter calling for action.   In the video report by ABN Telugu, one man recounted how he initially paid Abroad Study to begin his immigration process and agreed to pay more after Identity Malta (now Identità) issued their approval.    “They (Abroad Study Plan) told me that within three months he would finish the process and take me to Europe with a work visa, that is what was promised; for that, he told me that I needed to pay two lakhs (around €2,200) initially, and after I got Identity Malta approval I have to pay the rest.”   The man said that after some months, he realised the whole thing was “a big scam” and that only a small portion of the visas were being processed.   Another man said that people who make it to Europe do not fare much better.    “After paying €5,500 to these people, excluding flight expenses, they won’t respond for the people after reaching there, and they are staying without jobs for months on end, and they are again asking for money from their country,” he said. “If they do get jobs, they get something like car cleaning, which is not enough for people who had better jobs in India,” he said. Contacted for comment, Anilkumar Ghanta of Abroad Study Plan denied the allegations made in the police report. He said he never forged signatures or used fake documents. He insisted he always refunded at least 75 per cent of the money he was paid when visas were rejected. Ghanta claimed he could not return the full amount to rejected candidates because of fees charged by employers, Identity Malta, visa slot bookings and notaries. Ghanta said that workers he brought to Malta were usually given a job that paid some €1,000 per month. But in some cases, the job they were supposed to have would no longer be available because of the long migration process, he said. In such cases, Ghanta said he did his utmost to find other employment for people. Like any other business, Ghanta said he seeks to make a profit but “I do not throw people at the roadside”. “In some cases, I even paid out of pocket to help people,” he said.

Canadian ex-fashion mogul convicted of sexual assault,AFP,"Peter Nygard, the founder of one of Canada's largest clothing brands, was found guilty Sunday on four counts of sexual assault, a court announced in Toronto. The jury, which deliberated for five days, also acquitted the Finnish-Canadian Nygard on one count of sexually assaulting one of the women who testified at the seven-week trial, and one count of forcible confinement, according to Ontario's Superior Court of Justice. The charges against the onetime fashion mogul, now age 82, involved four women and a 16-year-old girl and date from incidents that occurred between 1988 and 2005. The trial addressed the first in a series of charges he faces for sex crimes against multiple women in Canada and the United States and spanning several decades. ""I know it's been a long and arduous case for you,"" Justice Robert Goldstein told the jury. On leaving the courthouse, Nygard's lawyer Brian Greenspan did not rule out the possibility of appealing the verdict. During closing arguments Greenspan had said the case was built on ""contradictions and innuendo"" and he panned the prosecution's portrayal of his client. ""To describe Peter Nygard as an evil predator, a Jekyll and Hyde personality who, through wealth and power, lured women to his den of iniquity and forced women to comply with his sexual demands... is neither fair nor accurate,"" he said. Greenspan said the complainants' testimony was at times ""painfully absurd,"" and he suggested that four of the women were motivated by financial gain or ""gold-digging,"" as they had admitted to being involved in a US class-action lawsuit against him. Prosecutor Ana Serban, on the other hand, said Nygard on the stand was evasive and inconsistent, and that his memory was unreliable and selective. Serban pointed to ""remarkably similar accounts"" of his five accusers, independent of each other, about how they met Nygard, were invited to his office building and ""how he sexually assaulted them in his private bedroom suite."" ""The similarities defy coincidence,"" she said. ""It's a pattern of behavior."" Testifying in his own defense, Nygard did not recall meeting or knowing four of his accusers, and insisted he never raped any of the five. ""The type of allegations that were said and were described is the type of conduct that I know that I have never done, I never would do,"" he told the court, even while admitting that his memory had become ""very fuzzy"" with age. Nygard, who in 1967 founded the firm that was to become Nygard International, has been held in detention since his arrest in 2020. He must now face similar charges in Quebec and Manitoba, as well as extradition to the United States, where he has been accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women and girls, racketeering and trafficking.

Belgian police seize nearly 700kg of cocaine at truck stop,AFP,"Belgian police discovered nearly 700 kilogrammes of cocaine in the back of a truck stopped in a freeway rest area near the port city of Antwerp, prosecutors said Sunday. The 46-year-old Bulgarian driver of the truck was arrested and is custody following the seizure made late Friday. Police found the 698 kilogrammes of cocaine stuffed inside sports bags in the truck's container, according to a statement from the Antwerp prosecutors' office. ""The drugs will be destroyed as quickly as possible,"" it added. Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for cocaine smuggled in from South America to reach the European market, and drug busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently. An unprecedented 110 tonnes of the illegal drug were seized at the port last year. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Marzia Maatouk joins her husband on Europe’s most-wanted list,Times of Malta,"Marzia Maatouk has been placed on Europol's list of Europe's most wanted fugitives joining her husband Jomic Calleja Maatouk who was placed soon after the couple went missing from Malta in August. Marzia Maatouk, 23, is wanted for Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. She was in July sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted of cannabis possession with intent. The crime took place in August 2019 when she was just 19.  Marzia and Jomic, 30, who was convicted of importing explosives, are believed to have absconded from Malta, probably by sea, since no official sea and air departures list included their names.  At the time, the police believed the couple was in Serbia and that they either used false passports to get out of the country or crossed to Sicily by sea and then drove through Italy northwards.  Soon after their disappearance, Marzia’s family told Times of Malta they were fearing for her safety after the couple’s home was found in a mess.

Photographic evidence exposes man who breached protection order,Edwina Brincat,"A man, spotted by his estranged partner close to her home in breach of a protection order, admitted to the wrongdoing on Saturday after being confronted with photographic evidence. The 27-year-old Qormi resident, whose name was banned from publication by the court, was arraigned following the incident earlier this month. His estranged partner had reported that on November 3 she had seen the accused in the vicinity of her home where he had been banned from going under a previous court order handed down in separate proceedings. The police sent for the man who denied the allegation. Yet, police proceeded to arrest him after obtaining photographic evidence that appeared to indicate he had been in the location.  He was charged with breaching previous bail conditions, breaching the terms of a protection order, insulting and threatening his ex-partner, as well as relapsing. The accused registered a guilty plea. His lawyer, Alfred Abela, requested bail pending delivery of judgment and also asked the court to appoint a probation officer to monitor the accused in the meantime. The court, presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, upheld the request against a deposit of €800, a personal guarantee of €10,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 8.30pm and 5.30am. The court also issued a temporary protection order in favour of the victim and her relatives, warning the accused that he was not to go anywhere near the woman or approach her in any manner. Inspector Colin Sheldon was prosecuting. Lawyer Alfred Abela was defence counsel. Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb appeared parte civile.

"Caught hiding in wardrobe, waiter admits to hotel thefts",Edwina Brincat,"A young waiter who was caught hiding inside a wardrobe when police searched his home, was granted bail pending sentencing over a string of thefts from Cottonera boutique hotels on Saturday. Redent Azzopardi, a 21-year-old Cospicua resident, was escorted to court on Saturday after being tracked down as the suspect behind a number of thefts that took place over a three-day span earlier this week.  Police received a report from the management of a boutique hotel about a number of items that had gone missing from the premises.  A close look at the CCTV footage from the area placed investigators on the tracks of a suspect who was seen entering the hotel some nine hours earlier. Similar reports from other commercial establishments around the harbour area were lodged. Working on surveillance cameras from the sites of the suspected thefts, police identified the same suspect and set about trying to track him down. When police knocked at the door of Azzopardi's family home, officers were informed the youth was not there. But after insisting on searching the residence, the policemen discovered the suspect, hiding inside a wardrobe. He was arrested. On Saturday, Azzopardi, who had no previous brushes with the law, was charged with various aggravated thefts. The court heard how on November 5, it was reported that an iPhone 12 model had gone missing from a Vittoriosa boutique hotel.  The following day, another boutique hotel at Cospicua reported that a cash box, containing €100, had gone missing. Another hotel in the locality reported the theft of several items during the night of November 7. Four television sets, a kettle, a hair dryer, a clothes iron, a microwave oven, a printer, bedsheets, and towels were among the items reported stolen. The following day, the boutique hotel targeted in the €100 theft, again reported that another €130 had been taken from the cash box. That same day, the owner of a Valletta beauty salon reported that €500 and keys had disappeared. Upon arraignment, the youth registered an admission which he confirmed after being granted time to reconsider and consult his lawyers. The court was told that the accused had a drug problem. For that reason, his lawyers, Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb requested the court to order a pre-sentencing report as well as supervision under bail conditions so as to help the young offender get his life back on track. In view of that early guilty plea, the prosecution did not object to bail as long as the court imposed adequate conditions. Magistrate Gabriella Vella upheld the requests and granted bail pending sentencing against a deposit of €600, a personal guarantee of €10,000, signing the bail book daily and under a curfew between 7.30pm and 5.30am. AG lawyer Alessia Schembri and Inspector Gabriel Kitcher prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.

Police arrest man in connection with Cospicua stabbing,Times of Malta,"Police have arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of having stabbed another man. The suspect, who is from Cospicua, is believed to have attacked a 35-year-old from the town with a sharp, pointed object. Officers became aware of the case on Saturday morning when the 35-year-old walked into the Cospicua police station, bleeding and injured. He told officers that he had just been attacked. The victim was then taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance. Doctors say he was grievously injured. Police officers said their investigations led them to a house on Triq il-Madonna tal-Grazzja. Inside, they found the 33-year-old and arrested him. Magistrate Gabriella Vella is leading an inquiry into the case. The police are also investigating.

Suspected trafficker who dropped cocaine bag in police station gets bail again,Edwina Brincat,"A suspected drug trafficker was granted his ninth bail application in a case of alleged bribery, a day after his eighth set of bail conditions were confirmed in a separate incident, sparked by a cocaine sachet he allegedly dropped while signing the bail book at the police station.  Terence Cini, a 38-year-old Qormi resident, landed in fresh trouble early in October when he allegedly dropped the drug-filled sachet at the local police station, sparking fresh investigations and criminal charges for simple drug possession and breaching seven previous bail decrees.  He pleaded not guilty when arraigned on November 3 and was granted bail against several stringent conditions including a €2,000 deposit and personal guarantee of €4,000.  However, that day he was escorted back to the Corradino Correctional Facility, where he had been remanded a few days before, after facing charges in a separate arraignment for allegedly offering a €47,000 bribe to a witness who was to testify against him in one of his pending cases.  The name of a criminal lawyer allegedly paid by Cini to approach the witness - John Mugliette - with the offer, had also featured in that arraignment.  During the hearing of the bribery case on Thursday, prosecuting Inspectors Mark Anthony Mercieca and John Lee Howard testified about how they found out about several phone calls that had taken place between Mugliette and Cini while the witness was behind bars.  The two had allegedly discussed the possibility of Cini paying Mugliette’s €40,000 fine as well as €7,000 in pending court expenses. Mugliette allegedly told Cini that he would not testify against him.  The court also heard that lawyer Matthew Xuereb had allegedly spoken to Mugliette in jail to discuss the payment of that fine.  Mugliette also testified, confirming the prosecutors’ account.  Following those testimonies, Magistrate Astrid May Grima upheld Cini’s request for bail against a deposit of €10,000, a personal guarantee of €20,000, signing the bail book three times daily and under a curfew between midnight and 6 am.  That court pronouncement was the key to Cini’s release from preventive custody.  On Wednesday his eighth bail, related to the case where he allegedly dropped a cocaine sachet at the police station, was confirmed by the Criminal Court. The Attorney General had sought to revoke that bail arguing that Cini was not at all trustworthy and would likely commit new offences if released from arrest.  He allegedly dropped the drug sachet while signing the bail book.  Ironically, while obeying bail conditions he was allegedly breaching them at the same time, the AG argued.  But Madam Justice Edwina Grima, presiding over the AG’s appeal, found no reason to vary Magistrate Noel Bartolo’s decision granting bail.  Cini was still presumed innocent and the investigators and prosecutors had allowed a month to lapse between the discovery of the dropped sachet and Cini’s arraignment. There was also no fear of tampering since all evidence was preserved in the records of the magisterial inquiry and witnesses were police officers and court experts, observed Judge Grima, thus confirming the bail.  Lawyers Franco Debono and Alfred Abela are counsel to Cini. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Man charged with possession of drugs found in car parked on double yellow line,Edwina Brincat,"A man reprimanded for parking on a double yellow line was on Thursday charged with possession of cannabis and cocaine that police officers found in his illegally parked car. Frederick Anthony Frendo, a 34-year old father who told the court that he gets by on social benefits because of a medical condition, was arrested on Wednesday at around 7pm after police patrolling the area spotted his vehicle on Andrew Cunningham Street, St Paul's Bay.  They initially asked Frendo to hand over his licence to check whether all was in order.  However, when they smelled cannabis, they informed him they would carry out a search to check whether any drug in his possession was above the legal limit.  The man cooperated, Inspector Ryan Vella, who pressed charges against Frendo, told the court. The officers discovered seven cannabis joints and three sachets of cannabis grass weighing 4.15 grams were discovered in the car. There were also ten sachets filled with suspected cocaine weighing 5.85 grams.  Upon arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty to possessing the drugs under circumstances denoting that the substances were not intended exclusively for personal use.  Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Nicholas Mifsud questioned whether the accused had been arrested over 4 grams of cannabis which was below the legal 7 gram limit.  The prosecutor countered that the circumstances of the search indicated that the illicit substances were not intended solely for the accused’s exclusive use. That search had also yielded a number of €5 and €10 banknotes.  However the prosecution did not object to a request for bail since the accused had cooperated all along and did not cause any problems.  As long as the court imposed stringent conditions, the accused’s character was no cause to object to bail.  The accused’s lawyer highlighted his client’s untainted record and the fact that minimal amounts of drugs were allegedly found in his possession.  After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil, upheld the request against a deposit of €1,000, a personal guarantee of €4,000, daily signing of the bail book and a curfew between 9pm and 7am.  The court also warned him not to approach any of the prosecution witnesses.  Inspector Gabria Gatt also prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Nicholas Mifsud were defence counsel.

Scammers target BOV customers in new wave of attacks,Times of Malta,"Bank of Valletta is warning customers to be wary of a series of new scams. Some are in the form of an SMS message that includes links to fake sites, claiming that customers’ debit or credit cards have been blocked, or that their password has been locked. Such messages ask potential victims to click on the link to release their cards or passwords. Potential victims are also being sent alerts about transaction authorisations, asking customers to insert their card data to cancel transactions if these are not authorised. Still other SMSs warn customers that their mobile signature is restricted and ask them to log onto a site guising as a BOV internet or mobile login to release the signature. BOV warned that some SMSs are being received in the same thread of messages that legitimately originate from the bank, deceiving customers into believing that BOV is sending this message. Fraudsters are also using emails to dupe potential victims.  ""These latest scams are designed to trick potential victims into taking urgent action and give out sensitive financial information such as bank account numbers, passwords, card details, or authorising financial transactions. ""It is important to keep in mind that BOV does not send SMSs containing links to websites. Customers should never click on links that appear in SMS messages, even if these appear in bank SMS threads, and should never give out sensitive information,"" the bank said in a statement.  The bank added it would not ask for account or card numbers in full, card CVV details (the 3 digits at the back of the card), card PINS, internet or mobile banking passwords, codes, signatures, one-time passwords, or multi-factor authentication. Bank employees will never ask customers for information that leads them to carry out financial transactions over the phone. When in doubt customers are urged to contact the bank immediately.

"'We cannot take action over hospitals' deal': AG, advocate, police chief tell PN",Edwina Brincat,"The State Advocate, Attorney General and Police Commissioner have rebutted the Opposition's call to take action against those involved in the “fraudulent” hospitals’ deal, saying they had no power to do so. Last week, Opposition leader Bernard Grech and MP Adrian Delia filed a judicial protest calling on the authorities to take action against those who defrauded the Maltese people.  That judicial act gave the authorities one week to take action as they were duty-bound to do. On Wednesday, two counter-protests were filed before the First Hall, Civil Court, stating that the State Advocate, AG and police chief were not empowered to do what was being requested of them.  The State Advocate - as chief legal advisor to the government - had already done all he could by acting upon the government’s instructions in arbitration proceedings between Steward and the government, the protest argued. And those arbitration proceedings, in terms of a clause in the contract between the two parties, were still pending. The law did not grant the State Advocate the power to take action on his own steam as Grech and Delia were expecting him to.  Likewise, in a separate counter-protest, the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner jointly argued that the functions of their respective offices were clearly defined by law. In light of their roles, the protesting parties’ request was “untenable"". The AG, as the state’s chief prosecutor, could not institute civil proceedings to claim damages.  RELATED STORIES  The AG’s role was defined in terms of criminal law and the functions of that office did not empower its holder to investigate allegations related to criminal offences.  Meanwhile, the Police Commissioner’s role was to enforce criminal law and not to file civil proceedings. Over the last years, the commissioner has been assisting the Magistrate handling the Vitals inquiry into the alleged crimes, helping her in the exercise of her duties not only by placing himself at her disposition but also by allocating all necessary resources, he said. The police corps has always acted under the direction of the inquiring magistrate, he added. Last month an appeals court declared all contracts between the government and Steward Healthcare to run three state hospitals as officially null and void. The decision confirmed a landmark judgment earlier in the year to end the deal on the basis that Steward had not fulfilled its contractual obligations to run Karin Grech, St Luke's and Gozo General Hospital.  Lawyer Julian Farrugia signed the State Advocate’s counter protest. Lawyers James D’Agostino and Miguel Degabriele signed the counter protest by the AG and Police Commissioner.

Man denies attacking sister-in-law's husband with knife,Edwina Brincat,"A man who allegedly attacked his sister-in-law’s husband with a knife and slightly injured him was remanded in custody with a recommendation to receive treatment at Mount Carmel Hospital. The 62-year old man was arraigned on Wednesday, just over three weeks since he was first arrested following the incident which took place inside a private residence in Mosta.  District policemen were alerted to a ‘fight’ that was allegedly taking place inside the house, prosecuting inspector Roderick Attard told court. When officers turned up at the residence they realised there had been no fight but a commotion triggered by an alleged knife attack by the accused. The suspected aggressor was arrested but was subsequently referred to Mount Carmel Hospital under police bail.  Upon discharge, the man was re-arrested and charged in court with allegedly assaulting the victim with a knife, inflicting slight injuries as well as being in possession of such a weapon without the necessary police licence.  He pleaded not guilty.  His lawyer Alex Scerri Herrer  did not request bail but in light of the accused’s medical condition requested the court to recommend his detention at Mount Carmel Hospital’s forensic unit. The prosecution did not object and Magistrate Abigail Critien upheld the request, issuing the relative recommendation to the prisons' director.

Man charged with breaching bail conditions escorted by three police officers,Edwina Brincat,"A man who on Wednesday was charged with breaching bail conditions and remanded in custody had to be escorted to a police car outside the Valletta law courts by three officers. Kurt Muscat, a 23-year old St Julian’s resident, protested loudly from the courtroom all the way to the car, after pleading not guilty to failing to keep his appointment with the bail book as ordered by the Criminal Court that released him from preventive arrest in separate proceedings.  In February a judge presiding over Muscat’s bail application had upheld a request for bail on condition that he would sign the bail book at the St Julian’s police station every day.  But the youth allegedly failed to turn up on several occasions, particularly throughout August.  Inspector Omar Zammit who was handling the criminal proceedings against Muscat, took matters into hand, getting directly in touch with the youth, who said that he had been unwell.  But when the situation persisted and officers stationed at St Julian’s flagged his absence, the inspector ordered Muscat’s immediate arrest.  The youth was escorted to court on Wednesday afternoon, pleading not guilty to the solitary charge of breaching bail.  His lawyer Francesca Zarb requested bail, arguing that the legislator had granted court discretion when imposing punishment for such breach of bail.  If the alleged breach was proved, the court could either order partial or full confiscation of the bail money, a fine or effective imprisonment.  In this case, the prosecutor was still to investigate the alleged breach so as to determine whether the accused’s “sporadic” failures to sign the bail book were justified.  The court had the necessary tools to strike a balance by imposing various conditions while granting the accused his personal freedom, argued the defence.  The prosecution objected since the charge itself related to alleged breach of bail and in view of the accused’s drug problem, he was unlikely to abide by court conditions.  In view of the nature of the charge, the court, presided over by Magistrate Abigail Critien, turned down the request.  No sooner was the youth escorted out of the courtroom than he started to complain loudly about  going to jail.  His tirade continued all the way to the car outside, and he had to be escorted by three officers. Franco Debono was also defence lawyer.

"Russia using gold to evade sanctions, warns UK",AFP,"The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) on Wednesday issued a red alert to the financial sector warning that Russia was using gold to evade sanctions imposed after it invaded Ukraine. The NCA said deliberate attempts were being made ""to launder sanctioned gold to mask its origin so that it can be hidden in supply chains and sold in the UK and around the world"". Gold exported from Russia since July 2022 is ""increasingly being shipped to countries that do not apply sanctions on Russian gold,"" said the agency, which tackles serious, organised and international crime. It can then be melted down and recast or refined, hiding its origins. As a result, the UK said on Wednesday that it had placed 29 new sanctions on ""individuals and entities operating in and supporting Russia's gold, oil and strategic sectors"". Those targeted include a United Arab Emirates-based network that the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office says is responsible for channelling more than $300 million in gold revenues to Russia.  The UK has also sanctioned two of Russia's largest gold producers, Nord Gold PLC and Highland Gold Mining Limited, along with Russian oligarchs Vladislav Sviblov and Konstantin Strukov.   Gold is a one of the largest income streams for Russia's war effort after oil and gas, and was worth £12.6 billion to the Russian economy in 2021.  ""This alert will aid efforts, in partnership with the regulated sector, including the banks and high value dealers, to ensure that sanctioned individuals or those who represent them cannot use gold to circumvent UK sanctions,"" said Adrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA. The London Bullion Market Association accredits gold refineries around the world and sets the standards for what constitutes ""London Good Delivery"" gold - the de facto global standard.  LBMA accredited refineries account for up to 92 percent of annual global mined gold production. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Mechanic admits to dismantling stolen vehicles at his Qormi garage,Edwina Brincat,"A mechanic who admitted to dismantling stolen vehicles at his Qormi garage has been granted bail after pleading guilty upon arraignment. A court heard on Wednesday that the police had come across a number of stolen vehicles inside Miroslav Mihalev's garage and a nearby parking area at the Ħandaq Industrial Estate between October 30 and November 6.  Following his arrest, the 34-year-old admitted to the charges of handling stolen property and knowingly covering up the traces of a crime.  His lawyer, Jacob Magri, requested bail pending sentencing, arguing that the accused had an otherwise untainted criminal record and had been living with family in Malta for 11 years.  Moreover, he had cooperated fully with police from the very start, answering every single question during his interrogation, he said, adding that Mihalev had also registered an early guilty plea.  All those factors made the accused “an ideal candidate” for a punishment that tended towards the minimum, argued the lawyer, suggesting a suspended sentence.  In light of the accused’s admission, the prosecution did not insist on an effective jail term.  After hearing those submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Abigail Critien, upheld a request for bail against a personal guarantee of €3,000, under a curfew between 8pm and 7.30am and signing the bail book once a week.  He was to abide by all conditions until judgment date, scheduled for December.  Inspectors Shawn Pawney, Jeffrey Scicluna and Stephen Gulia prosecuted.

Identity Malta stuck with Nexia BT after passport kickback allegations,Jacob Borg,"A firm implicated in a “passport kickbacks” scheme ran payroll for the government agency responsible for regulating passport sales to rich foreigners, documents show. The now-defunct Nexia BT was contracted to run payroll services for Identity Malta, since renamed Identità, in 2014. Two years later, the audit and advisory firm found itself at the heart of a corruption scandal involving ex-government officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi. But Nexia BT had its contract for payroll services renewed in 2018 by Identity Malta, one year after its managing partner Brian Tonna was implicated in a passport kickback scheme with Schembri. Tonna allegedly passed on a €100,000 kickback to Schembri from the sale of three Maltese passports to three wealthy Russians. The pair, who deny wrongdoing, have since been charged with money laundering and corruption. Although the kickback claims were publicly known in 2017, Identity Malta’s then-CEO Anton Sevasta still signed off on a renewal of the payroll contract in May 2018. At that stage, the running of the passports scheme had been hived off to another agency. Sevasta now heads the Asset Recovery Bureau, an agency responsible for freezing and seizing criminal assets. In response to a parliamentary question by PN MP Karol Aquilina, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said the payroll contract between Nexia BT and Identity Malta expired in 2019. In 2020, Nexia BT and its parent company, BT International, had its licence to sell passports to wealthy foreigners suspended. The PQ also revealed how Nexia BT provided “specialised consultancy and advisory services” for the setting up of Identity Malta in 2013. Nexia BT went on to receive millions of euros in contracts during the heyday of ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat’s government. Nexia BT was instrumental in setting up secretive offshore structures in Panama for Schembri and Mizzi.  RELATED STORIES  The people behind Nexia have also been linked to major government projects that have since been marred in corruption. Tonna sat on one of the selection committees that picked Electrogas as the preferred bidder to build a new power station when Labour first shot back to power a decade ago. Schembri and Mizzi were banned from travelling to the United States in 2021 due to their involvement in “significant corruption” in the Electrogas contract award process.  RELATED STORIES  Tonna’s right-hand man, Karl Cini, similarly sat on the selection committee that picked Vitals Global Healthcare as the top people to run three public hospitals in Malta. The hospitals deal, which was terminated on fraud grounds in February, is also the subject of a separate magisterial inquiry.

"Tackling unruly, young gangs",Times of Malta,"A teenager suffered a fractured leg after he was violently assaulted by a group of adolescents in Valletta last January. The prime minister was among many who expressed their disgust, saying he did not deem it safe allowing his daughter to walk alone in the capital. Insisting that every citizen must be responsible for maintaining public order and that parents had a responsibility to raise their children as peaceful citizens, he called for more police presence in Valletta. Comments on social media made it abundantly clear that incident was by no means an isolated case of teenage misbehaviour. Valletta councillor Mark Spiteri Lucas had told Times of Malta reports of teenage gangs harassing residents were not uncommon. In his view, the necessary resources had to be allocated to the police as, otherwise, “we’re just waiting for a tragedy to occur”. It seems the situation has deteriorated with businesses in the capital having to engage security staff to maintain some order and protect themselves and customers. Video recordings depicting teens beating each other in Valletta have recently been shared on social media. In one of them, a girl is seen being kicked and punched by other girls and another showed a gang of boys fighting, with screams heard in the background. Judging by reports made by Valletta businesses, the problem of sizeable groups of teenagers causing trouble is growing. Some of these incidents are taking place right by City Gate, the heart of the capital. Left unchecked, these unruly young people risk dismantling the hard work put in over the years by so many to revitalise Valletta – without going into the merits as to whether we have now gone to the other extreme. Furthermore, the fact that the perpetrators can act with practical impunity raises the issue of ineffective law enforcement and what lies behind it. Visible regular police patrols will, no doubt, serve as a deterrent. A study commissioned by the police force and conducted by the National Statistics Office had found that eight out of every 10 respondents felt officers should be out on patrol rather than located in a police station. Six out of 10 said they did not see policemen on the streets often enough. As incidents like the ones in Valletta surface, such ‘fear’ among society is likely to increase. The real cause remains unclear. Reacting to last January’s assault, the prime minister said the police had been given all the resources they asked for. The Valletta councillor’s comments appear to contradict that. Speaking about crime figures earlier this year, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà said that cases of bodily harm in Valletta had dropped by a fifth when compared to 2011. This is positive, but the cases appearing on social media, and, which, admittedly, may not all have been reported to the police, are disconcerting. A robust action plan must be drawn up urgently. The Valletta local council, home affairs ministry and the police must work together to get to the root of the problem, agree on the necessary allocation of resources, and ensure people feel safe in their locality. The same should be done in other towns and villages which have also witnessed the emergence of gangs. Unruly gangs cannot simply be dismissed as an inconvenience expected from the younger generation, especially when they are now turning violent.

Teen granted bail after punching ex's boyfriend,Edwina Brincat,"A 16-year old who allegedly punched his ex’s boyfriend after the two met to “sort out” a matter about some anonymous letters, was granted bail on Tuesday after admitting to his third brush with the law.  The teenager from Cospicua, whose name was banned from publication because he is a minor, was arrested after his victim reported the incident that took place on October 29 at Senglea.  He had apparently agreed to meet the accused near the Macina in Senglea to sort out matters relating to some anonymous letters allegedly received by the accused’s former girlfriend.  After that meeting, just as the victim was driving away with the 15-year old girl seated next to him in the car, a third party came up and removed the key from the ignition. The accused then walked up and punched him, the victim told the police.  The victim needed surgery to treat his dislocated jaw, the court was told.  The 16-year old offender was charged with causing grievous injuries to his victim in the presence of the underage girl. Moreover, that offence was allegedly committed during the operative term of a probation order handed down in April and a suspended sentence handed down in June.  The accused’s lawyer, Leontine Calleja, said that he was registering an admission but requested a pre-sentencing report.  That request was not objected to by the prosecution and was upheld by the court.  “You’re just 16 and you’ve already had these brushes with the law,”remarked Magistrate Joseph Mifsud, warning the teen that he would end up behind bars unless he changed his ways.  In light of the circumstances and the accused’s early guilty plea, the court upheld the defence’s request for bail against a personal guarantee of €5,000, signing the bail book three times weekly and under a curfew between 9pm and 7am.  The court also issued a protection order in favour of the victim.  AG lawyer Giuliana Magro Conti and Inspectors Kurt Farrugia and Keith Rizzo prosecuted.

Man denied bail after allegedly indecently touching woman on bus,Edwina Brincat,"A man who caused a commotion aboard a public bus by allegedly touching a female passenger’s chest and escaping police custody following arrest, was on Tuesday denied bail.  Ahmed Salah Mowlid, 20, was escorted to court following his arrest on Sunday when a bus driver pulled over at the Malta International Airport seeking the help of security officers to get the unruly passenger off the bus.  The youth made the unwelcome move towards a female passenger who was travelling with her boyfriend on the X4 route bus. The indecent touch triggered a commotion, prompting the driver to stop and seek assistance.  The alleged aggressor put up a struggle, shouting and swearing, explained prosecuting Inspector Roxanne Tabone, who charged Mowlid with committing a non-consensual sexual act, insulting and threatening a public official, slightly injuring a third party, resisting arrest, offending public morals, uttering foul words while drunk as well as failing to obey legitimate police orders.  He was also charged with subsequently escaping from police custody.  The accused pleaded not guilty.  A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution and was subsequently turned down by the court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Mifsud who upheld a request for a Protection Order in favour of the victim.

"19-year-old beat his partner and hit her young children, court told",Edwina Brincat,"A 19-year-old whipped his partner with a phone cable and assaulted her four children, including an 18-month-old toddler, a court heard on Monday. The charges against 19-year old Luke Galea from Siġġiewi date back to September when his partner reported him to the police domestic violence unit over two separate violent episodes that allegedly took place on September 22 and 23.  The woman claimed that her partner, who was not the father of her children, had beaten her with a phone charger cable, an umbrella as well as a rolling pin at her St Paul’s Bay home.  The violence was allegedly witnessed by the victim’s children aged 18 months, three, five and six years.  During the first incident, the accused also allegedly assaulted the minors. The following day, the man allegedly hit the toddler on the face.  The child was subsequently certified as suffering slight injuries to the forehead.  When spoken to by officers from Child Protection Services, the minors said  their mother had been whipped with a phone cable by the accused who had also had thrown plates at her.  Galea was arrested and charged with slightly injuring the mother and her children, assaulting them as well as failing to inform the relative authorities about his change of address.  He pleaded not guilty.  Answering questions from the defence, prosecuting inspector Audrey Micallef said that the accused’s partner had not gone to the police station to withdraw or update her report.  There was no request for bail at arraignment stage but a request to ban publication of all parties’ names.  However after hearing the prosecutor object to the ban in so far as the accused was concerned - since the couple had only been in a relationship for a year or so - the court, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, upheld the ban only for the mother and the minors.

"Keith Schembri's confiscated phone goes missing, is found in another case file",Edwina Brincat,"Updated 4.10pm A phone owned by Keith Schembri, held by the courts as part of the evidence in a money laundering case against him went missing for weeks, only to be found in the file of a separate case. This is the second phone owned by the former OPM chief of staff to go missing, after another mobile of his was not found when he was arrested in November 2019 in connection with the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. While in that 2019 incident, Schembri told police that he had misplaced his phone, in this most recent case the phone was lost while in the courts' possession.  Schembri now wants this phone to be struck off as evidence in the case against him, arguing that the odd way his phone was lost and then found by the courts “was far more serious than simply bad administration"".  Criminal proceedings against Schembri, his father Alfio and business associates, Robert Zammit and Malcolm Scerri, were stalled for weeks, as the Attorney General was to decide whether to issue a bill of indictment or have the case decided by the Magistrates’ Court.  Then some weeks ago, the prosecuting lawyer from the AG’s office informed Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech - who is presiding over the money laundering case - that Schembri’s phone, seized by police during their investigation into suspected financial crimes, was not in the case file.  When further searches for the device proved futile, the court ordered the expert who last handled the phone to testify so that he could shed light as to the device’s whereabouts.  But the expert said that although he had extracted data from that phone, he had no clue about the device’s location after completing his task.  Faced with that testimony, the magistrate suspended the sitting so as “to look for the phone in her chambers”.  Barely 20 minutes later, Schembri’s lawyers were informed that the missing phone had been traced.  It had somehow ended up in another case file, namely the records of the criminal case against Zenith Finance directors Matthew Pace and Lorraine Falzon, Schembri’s lawyers were told.  But the lawyers noted that the records of the Zenith case had already moved on from the magistrate’s chamber since the directors had opted to go to trial, and thus their file had been forwarded to the Criminal Court.  Following the recovery of the ‘missing’ phone, Magistrate Frendo Dimech dictated a lengthy minute, attributing blame for the disappearance to the courts’ maladministration.  She highlighted the ""pitiful"" way in which evidence was held by the courts, with evidence ""spread across the floor in unsealed bags of papers"" and said court workers were often reduced to buying boxes and tape out of their own pocket. The magistrate's criticism comes just one week after the Association of the Maltese Judiciary warned that the under-resourced court system is ""on the brink of collapse"". Shortly after that episode, an application was filed by lawyers representing “a third party” in separate criminal proceedings, asking the Criminal Court to authorise Schembri’s phone to be produced in evidence in those other proceedings. The case is not linked to the Zenith proceedings.  The sequence of events behind what Schembri's lawyers described as the “whole saga” of the missing phone has now prompted fresh constitutional proceedings by Schembri who claims his right to a fair hearing has been violated.  The “coincidences” and timings after the disappearance of the phone, which was suddenly requested as “an important piece of evidence” in separate proceedings, could not but spark suspicions as to what actually happened “behind the scenes”, Schembri’s lawyers claimed.  The fact that for weeks the phone could not be located was not only a “most serious incident” reflecting grave shortcomings in the way proceedings against Schembri were being handled, but also cast doubt upon the chain of custody of his phone.  This important piece of evidence could have been tampered with since there are doubts as to who had access to the phone during all the weeks that it went missing. It was also inexplicable how the phone was then found within minutes, they said. In the best-case scenario, such circumstances rendered the phone inadmissible since the process was riddled with procedural defects. In the worst-case scenario, what happened hinted at “illegal and possibly criminal behaviour”, argued Schembri’s lawyers in their application filed against the Attorney General, the Police Commissioner and the Registrar Criminal Courts and Tribunals.  Unlike what Magistrate Frendo Dimech had minuted, the lawyers feared that what actually happened “was far more serious than simply bad administration,” said the lawyers calling for the case to be heard urgently.  They also requested the court to declare that Schembri’s rights were breached, that the chain of custody over his phone had been broken and that it was therefore inadmissible in evidence. They sought moral damages and other measures deemed appropriate by the court. Lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo signed the application.

Hamburg airport hostage-taker gives himself up,AFP,"An armed father who took his four-year-old daughter hostage, forcing the suspension of flights at Hamburg airport, gave himself up ""without resistance"" on Sunday after hours of negotiations, German police said. The 35-year-old Turkish man had barricaded himself and the child in his car at the foot of a Turkish Airlines plane on Saturday evening, demanding to be allowed on board after a custody dispute with the mother.  He had rammed his car through the security area onto the apron where planes are parked, firing two shots in the air and throwing two burning bottles out of the vehicle, police said. ""The hostage-taking has ended,"" local police posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday. ""The man has left his car with his daughter and been taken for questioning by security forces without resistance,"" it said, adding the child ""seems in good health"". Police had brought psychologists and teams of negotiators as well as rapid response units to the airport in northern Germany. Authorities said a dispute over custody of the child was believed to be behind the incident, with the wife of the driver placing an emergency call alerting police to the abduction of her child. Police said the man was suffering from psychological troubles and kidnapped the daughter at the mother's home in the nearby town of Stade on Saturday before going to Hamburg airport. They described lengthy negotiations which had taken place in Turkish and announced the father was believed to be ""in possession of a loaded weapon and perhaps explosives"". The man had at first demanded to be allowed to fly to Turkey with his daughter. During the negotiations, police said that the girl appeared to be physically well, but would not comment on her mental state. The father had already been investigated after kidnapping his daughter in March 2022 and taking her to Turkey. The mother recovered her there, according to the police. - 'Amateurish' security -Passengers aboard the Turkish Airlines plane and the rest of the airport were safely evacuated. ""It's annoying. The important thing is that nothing happened to us,"" passenger Roland Kaminski told German television. ""The hotels are all full. Now we're supposed to find beds here somehow."" Air traffic remained suspended by late Sunday afternoon, affecting dozens of flights and thousands of passengers. On Saturday evening, 17 flights scheduled to land in Hamburg were diverted. The incident has raised further questions about the airport's security given the ease with which the man forced his way onto the tarmac. In July, environmental activists protesting against pollution caused by planes blocked traffic at the airport for several hours after bursting in on bicycles. ""How is it possible that a father in his Audi can simply plough through a barrier and gain access to a high-security zone?,"" Heinrich Grosbongardt, a well-known air traffic expert in Germany, wrote in Der Spiegel magazine. Heiko Teggatz, a representative of the German police union, said it was ""hard to understand"" that concrete blocks were used to protect Christmas markets while airports ""were made safe in an amateurish way"".

Hamburg airport flights halted over 'hostage' situation,AFP,"Air traffic at Hamburg airport remained suspended Sunday over a suspected hostage situation on the tarmac involving a child, local authorities said. A gunman rammed his car through the security area onto the apron where planes are parked on Saturday evening, firing two shots in the air and flinging two burning bottles out of the vehicle, police said. On Sunday morning the airport management posted on X, formerly Twitter, that efforts to negotiate with the driver of the vehicle were still ongoing. ""The police operation continues, air traffic remains suspended until further notice,"" posted the management of the northern German airport. Police spokeswoman Sandra Levgrun told the regional channel of public television NDR that it is believed a father and his child are in the car. Authorities have said a ""custody dispute"" is believed to be the cause of the incident, with the wife of the driver placing an emergency call alerting police to the abduction of her child. The daily Bild newspaper reported that the driver is 35 years old and of Turkish nationality, and that the child is a girl aged four years old. The driver has barricaded himself in his car at the foot of a Turkish Airlines plane. ""We are on site with a large contingent of emergency services. We are currently assuming a static hostage situation,"" Hamburg police had posted earlier on X. Levgrun told NDR that police psychologists had been mobilised to try to negotiate a solution with the driver. She called it a ""very good sign"" that he had remained in contact with the authorities over a prolonged period of time. On Saturday evening, 17 flights scheduled to land in Hamburg were diverted. Another 286 flight are scheduled for Sunday, carrying some 34,500 passengers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Fruit vendor gets suspended jail term in €25,000 fraud case",Matthew Xuereb,"A fruit and vegetable seller who defrauded three people out of €25,000 was jailed for two years suspended for four after he was convicted of fraud. The 44-year-old man, whose name was banned from publication, was given three years to return the sum he had gained illicitly. He has since paid back €5,000 of the amount he swindled. The court heard very little details of the case since the man changed his plea to guilty before his victims could testify. The crime was committed on and before September 2021. During his arraignment, the man was inclined to register an admission but then had a change of heart after the court, presided over by Magistrate Charmaine Galea, observed that he had been handed a three-year probation order over similar charges in the past. Upon his admission during the compilation of evidence, Magistrate Joe Mifsud ordered a pre-sentencing report, with a probation officer recommending to the court that the man is given a suspended jail term and ordered to repay his victims. Handing down his judgment, Mifsud explained how a punishment should serve as an opportunity for a person who was convicted of a crime to learn from his mistakes. In the circumstances, the court believed that he should be given time to reform and bring his life back on the right track. In considering what punishment should be meted out, Magistrate Mifsud said that if he were to order the restitution of the amount he swindled, this would not be possible if he were to be jailed and the victims would remain without their money. He, therefore, opted to uphold the recommendation in the pre-sentencing report and hand down a suspended jail term. He also urged the defendant to continue addressing his problems. Police inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Shaun Pawney prosecuted, while lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb were defence counsel.

Charges dropped against suspended Malta Philharmonic conductor - lawyers,Jessica Arena,"The suspended principal conductor of the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra has been acquitted of fraud charges, his lawyers have said.  Sergey Smbatyan was suspended from his role in the orchestra in July, after international media reported that he and his father - a former Armenian ambassador to Israel - were arrested on charges related to real estate fraud in their native Armenia.  In a statement, Smbatyan’s lawyers said the Armenian prosecutor’s office had decided to stop pursuing the charges against him. “Herewith we inform you that by the decision of the Prosecutor of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Armenia dated October 27, 2023, Maestro Sergey Smbatyan was acquitted, and the criminal prosecution against him was ceased on the basis that he did not commit the guilty act,” the statement said.   RELATED STORIES  At the time of the arrest, the acting CEO of the orchestra Christopher Muscat said that the MPO was “suspending” its relationship with Smbatyan until “the relevant facts and circumstances are ascertained”.  In Armenia, Smbatyan also serves as the artistic director and principal conductor of the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra.  In a statement on Facebook, Smbatyan said that the outcome of the legal proceedings against him could only have “one resolution”.  “That was to clarify unnecessary public misunderstandings and denial of the accusations made against me,” he said.    “Thank you to everyone who has stood by me over the past months and waited with me in faith for this day. Your faith inspires and keeps me moving.” Times of Malta asked the MPO and the Culture Ministry whether there were any plans to reinstate Smbatyan as the principal conductor of the orchestra.

Australian woman faces court for alleged mushroom murders,AFP,"An Australian woman appeared in court Friday accused of murdering her inlaws with a toxic mushroom lunch and attempting to kill her estranged husband four times. Erin Patterson, 49, is charged with three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous beef Wellington that killed her parents-in-law and a third lunch guest, the wife of a local pastor. Police have previously suggested the crusted beef fillet was laced with death cap mushrooms. Patterson, a former newsletter editor, was taken into custody this week following a headline-grabbing, three-month investigation.  The alleged triple murder has rocked the sedate farming town of Leongatha, about two hours' drive southeast of Melbourne. Leongatha is better known for its medieval society's re-enactments and its annual daffodil festival. Patterson has also been charged with repeatedly trying to murder her estranged husband Simon Patterson, who was identified in police charge sheets released to the media on Friday. Police said Simon Patterson ""became ill after meals"" on separate occasions in 2021 and 2022, and have charged Erin Patterson with four counts of attempted murder.  The 49-year-old was flanked by guards as she made her first appearance in Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court on Friday morning. She wore a beige jersey and appeared composed throughout the brief administrative hearing. Patterson will return to court in May 2024 after police secured a 20-week adjournment so that detectives have enough time to comb through computers seized from her house.  Patterson allegedly cooked the beef Wellington in late July, serving her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather, 66. The two couples allegedly started experiencing food poisoning symptoms later that night and, with their health rapidly deteriorating, they sought the help of doctors at local hospitals. Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson died in the days following the lunch while Ian Wilkinson eventually recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital. Patterson has repeatedly protested her innocence, saying she had bought the mushrooms from an Asian grocery store and was ""devastated"" that her cooking may have caused her loved ones to fall ill.  Detectives spent Thursday searching through Patterson's house in Leongatha. Homicide squad Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said the intense media scrutiny surrounding the investigation had taken its toll on the sleepy rural town, where the consequences would ""reverberate for years to come"".  ""Over the last three months, this investigation has been subjected to incredibly intense levels of public scrutiny and curiosity,"" he said in a statement Thursday following Patterson's arrest.  ""I cannot think of another investigation that has generated this level of media and public interest, not only here in Victoria but also nationally and internationally. ""I think it is particularly important that we keep in mind that at the heart of this, three people have lost their lives."" Death cap mushrooms sprout freely throughout wet, warm parts of Australia and are easily mistaken for edible varieties. They reportedly taste sweeter than other types of mushrooms but possess potent toxins that slowly poison the liver and kidneys.

Valletta businesses forced to ‘hire security’ to tackle teen gangs,Daniel Tihn,"Teen gangs are visiting Valletta on weekends to fight and destroy property, forcing at least two businesses to hire security to tackle the problem. “They run around, take stuff from tables and try to get a rise out of people,” said one worker from a café opposite the parliament building. “They want to start fights but we will not start fights. Instead we call security or the police,” another worker from the capital’s Burger King outlet said. Large groups of teens starting fights in the city have become a growing problem. A series of videos showing teens beating each other in Valletta were recently shared on social media. One video showed a girl being kicked and punched by other girls near Hastings Garden while another showed a gang of boys fighting while screams are heard in the background.   These are not isolated problems but regular occurrences, shop workers told Times of Malta, as large groups of “rude” teens loiter around the city entrance every weekend. “They come in here every Saturday and throw things around,” a Burger King worker said. With several outlets across the island, Burger King Valletta is close to the entrance of the city, opposite parliament. “Last Saturday, someone came behind the counter, came into our kitchen and started shouting at staff,” they said, prompting security to kick them out. “We have a security guard every Saturday simply because of these groups of teens,” they said. The problem has persisted for at least a year, the worker said, recalling a time when he kicked out a group of roughly five teens – boys and girls – after they destroyed some chairs and a table.  RELATED STORIES  “They waited for me outside the restaurant on two Saturday nights,” the worker said, prompting the worker to call the police. Yet, once the police arrived, the group dispersed and ran off to another spot within Valletta, they said. A worker from L’Accademia Café, in Valletta, also opposite parliament, explained that between 40 and 50 teens regularly group together on Saturday evenings, hassling customers and causing commotion. “They stand on tables and steal chairs. Sometimes, they fight over there,” the employee said, pointing at a space in front of parliament. “We try to stop them but they either ignore us or they're rude to us,” they said. “Sometimes, we even had to hire security,” they said, as festive seasons see more rowdy teens come to the city. With Christmas around the corner, L’Accademia workers are worried about the surge of teens who will come to Valletta, as school holidays will give adolescents more free time to gather. There have been sporadic cases of people being seriously injured after being attacked by teen gangs. In January, a 15-year-old boy was hospitalised with a broken leg after he and his friends were attacked by a group of older teens in Valletta. A 30-year-old woman also came forward about an incident in December when she was punched, kicked and had her hair ripped out by a gang of young teens. Speaking to Times of Malta, one 17-year-old shared his personal experience with one of these groups that left him hospitalised in October 2022. “These people tracked me down and followed me home,” he said. He described walking home from a friend’s house in October last year when he noticed a large group of roughly 16 teens following him. “’We just want to talk,’” he recalled them telling him, asking him to come to a corner to have a chat. They walked the 17-year-old to a nearby restaurant where the incident turned violent. “It ended up with 16 people pushing me up against a wall and beating me,” he said. “All I was thinking was ‘I just want to go home and forget this ever happened’.” Passers-by tried to intervene but the group told them to keep walking, he said. Bloody and bruised, the teenager walked to the Valletta police station where officers took him back to the spot of the beating. “No one was there, they had all scattered and gone elsewhere.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

US policeman pleads guilty in beating death of man,AFP,"One of the five US police officers charged in the beating death of a young African-American man in the southern city of Memphis pleaded guilty Thursday, the Justice Department announced. Bodycam footage of the January incident showed the officers, who are all Black, repeatedly kicking and punching Tyre Nichols, 29, during a traffic stop close to his home in Memphis. Nichols died in hospital three days later. The guilty plea by Desmond Mills comes as part of a settlement of pending state and federal charges, and marks a course reversal given that he had pleaded not guilty along with the other four officers in February when they appeared in court in Tennessee. Already facing felony charges from the state of Tennessee, the five police officers were indicted in September by a federal grand jury in Memphis. Mills, 33, pleaded guilty Thursday to two of four counts in the indictment -- excessive force and failing to intervene as well as an attempted coverup -- according to a statement from the Justice Department. The Shelby County District Attorney's office said in a statement that the plea was ""part of a global settlement of all pending state and federal charges and comes after Mills pled guilty this morning to these federal charges."" The other four officers have pleaded not guilty to federal charges. Lawyers for Nichols's family, who are suing the city of Memphis in civil court over his death, said the Mills plea confirmed he was not ""an individual actor"" in the crime. ""These officers, including Mills, acted at the direction of a policy that not only violated civil rights of innocent civilians but which caused needless pain to many,"" they said in a statement. The trial of the other four police officers is scheduled for May 2024, according to the statement. Nichols was stopped for an alleged traffic violation and was beaten viciously by the officers, in scenes recorded in body camera and security camera footage that triggered outrage when made public. Vice President Kamala Harris attended Nichols' funeral in February and Nichols' family members were invited to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address in Washington several days later.

Man arrested following series of thefts from cars in St Paul's Bay,Times of Malta,"A 35-year-old man was arrested in St Paul's Bay on Wednesday, following a series of thefts from cars in the area throughout September and October. The police said in a statement the man, a Croatian who lives in St Paul's Bay, was tracked down by district officials soon after they received a report that a person was seen trying to break into a car. The officers patrolled the area and when they spotted the man, they gave chase. He entered a block of apartments and jumped a height of around a storey and a half into a private garden. He jumped over another wall with the police on his tail. The man was eventually tracked down in a garage complex. A search at his house yielded several items that had been reported stolen in the previous months.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Commotion in Marsascala after argument, unverified claims of gunfire",Times of Malta,"Confusion and commotion reigned in Marsascala on Thursday evening after an alleged argument and claims of ""gunfire sounds"" led to a heavy police presence. The argument in Triq Sant' Antnin was reported at around 4.30pm, with the police receiving reports from one of the men involved that he had heard gunshot sounds shortly after the altercation.   Within minutes, at least seven police cars were spotted on site by Times of Malta readers, including the Rapid Intervention Unit.  However, once on site, the officers did not find anybody injured and there was no evidence of any gunfire, a police spokesperson told Times of Malta.

Israeli strikes on Gaza refugee camp could be war crimes: UN,AFP,"Deadly Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip's largest refugee camp ""could amount to war crimes"", the UN Human Rights Office said on Wednesday.  Israeli strikes have targeted the Jabalia refugee camp twice in two days, killing and wounding dozens, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.  Israel said Tuesday's raid was a successful hit on top Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari. ""Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes,"" the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza in retribution for the worst attack in the country's history. Hamas gunmen stormed across the border from Gaza on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.  Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign has killed 8,796 people, mainly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry. The principle of proportionality referred to by the UN plays a central role in the wars of law defined by the Geneva Conventions. Civilians and civilian structures must be spared - but the death of civilians during a conflict does not necessarily constitute a war crime. Warring parties can launch attacks deemed proportionate on military targets even while knowing that civilians could also be hit.  A crime is committed when an attack is deliberately carried out against civilians, or if the scale of the damage to civilians is excessive compared to the military advantage. The International Criminal Court is the only independent international legal authority that carries out investigations into genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, but Israel is not a member. AFPTV images from Wednesday's strike on the camp showed extensive damage and rescuers clawing through rubble to extract blood-stained casualties. The large death toll from the strikes has drawn a chorus of international condemnation, with Bolivia severing diplomatic ties with Israel in protest. Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel ""to condemn the Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza"". UN chief Antonio Guterres is ""appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza, including the killing of Palestinians, including women and children in Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp"", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday.

Germany moves to classify sexual violence as war crime,AFP,"The German government on Wednesday approved a draft law allowing sexual violence in conflict zones to be prosecuted as a war crime and a crime against humanity. The centre-left-led coalition passed a justice ministry measure allowing a change to Germany's criminal code. It would permit Germany to probe such crimes committed abroad under the principle of ""universal jurisdiction"". The change would mean that the existing war crimes definition would be expanded to encompass sexual assault, sexual enslavement and forced pregnancy termination. ""Sexual violence, primarily against women, has long been used in conflict worldwide by terrorists, systematically in armed conflicts and as a tactical weapon,"" German family and women's affairs minister Lisa Paus told AFP.  Berlin was seeking to bolster ""the rights of the victims of this horrible crime by allowing them to take an active part in the criminal trial"" as co-plaintiffs, Paus said. The impetus behind the new legislation, which still requires parliamentary approval, was widespread accounts of sexual assault since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she said. Paus of the Green party also pointed to reports of the rape of Israelis by Hamas fighters in the October 7 attacks. ""International criminal law has become dramatically relevant since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Justice Minister Marco Buschmann of the liberal Free Democrats said in a statement.   The third party in the ruling coalition, the Social Democrats, noted the importance of the legal reform in explicitly protecting LGBTQ people in war zones, calling it ""historic"". ""War crimes"" and ""crimes against humanity"" were both defined in the 1998 Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). A war crime covers more than 50 scenarios, including killing, torture, rape and hostage-taking. Germany has in the past repeatedly prosecuted atrocities committed abroad, including in the war in Syria.  It does so using universal jurisdiction which allows countries to try people for crimes of exceptional gravity, including war crimes and genocide, even if they were committed in a different country. UN investigators probing violations in Ukraine since Russia's invasion reported in March that Moscow was behind a vast array of war crimes, including widespread attacks on civilians and infrastructure, killings, torture, rape and other sexual violence.

"Plasterer used shadow finance system to move millions, terrorism case told",Matthew Xuereb,"A Syrian man arrested following a magisterial inquiry into reports of terrorism-related activity in Malta transferred some €2.5 million to 13 countries in two years, an investigation has revealed. A money laundering inspector testified that the transfers were multi-national, including Australia, Belgium, Iraq, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. He was testifying against the 35-year-old plasterer Ebrahem Ahmad who stands accused of money laundering, operating an illegal banking service operation and involvement in a criminal organisation. He is pleading not guilty. The officer's investigation revealed that Ahmad had allegedly been offering banking services without a licence. The Financial Crimes Investigation Department inspector testified before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech. He said investigations began around mid-April this year when the FCID was asked to assist the antiterrorism squad in an investigation into a group that was spreading pro-ISIS material. Seven men were subsequently charged with terrorism-related offences. The inspector – whose name cannot be published by court order - said the defendant was known as “the banker,” and would use the hawala money transfer system to pay for travel and other goods and services. According to the International Monetary Fund, hawala is an informal system of transferring money around the world. Along with its traditional role of transferring money between individuals and families, often in different countries, it is also linked with financing illegal and terrorist activities. The inspector said Ahmad did not have any bank accounts in Malta. However, he was registered with the VAT and Inland Revenue departments as a self-employed plasterer. He had also been given a Maltese social security number, but had never received any social benefits, said the inspector. The inspector explained that during an anti-terror raid, the police had to force open the front door to the apartment in question, finding three men, two women and four children inside - all relatives of Ahmad. While searching the apartment, the inspector looked out of a bathroom window into the shaft and noticed an object that appeared to be a mobile phone at the bottom. It was retrieved and found to have a picture of the defendant’s youngest son on the lock screen. “At first he tried to justify his financial dealings by claiming that he would help the local Syrian community in dealing with banks in Turkey but he later admitted to using hawala to transfer money to a relative in Syria and another man on the Turkey-Syria border,” the inspector said. Data recovered from his mobile phone showed that the men who were currently accused of terrorism offences had used his services to send money to their families in Syria. The device also contained receipts from overseas companies that are involved in money transfers, involving 13 different countries, which include Australia, Belgium, Iraq, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. “In two years he transferred a total of around €2.5 million. He would charge between three and 10 per cent commission on the money transferred,” said the inspector, explaining that the amounts transferred were also reflected in chat records with his overseas contact in Syria. The head of MFSA’s banking sector, Anthony Sacco, told the court that Ahmad had no licence to operate a banking operation in Malta. He was asked at which point would transferring of funds be considered a banking operation, but the witness could not reply.   “Can a person receive a sum of money, travel to another country and pass it on to a third party?” defence counsel Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea asked. “If used legitimately he can,” replied the witness, who went on to explain that a banking licence “means you can accept deposits and lend money.” “Is hawala banking an accepted banking practice? Would you need a banking licence for it?” Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech asked the witness, who replied that he had never heard of it. When the case against another two Syrian men charged with possession and dissemination of terrorism-related material was called, Magistrate Frendo Dimech recused herself after it was pointed out that she had also led the magisterial inquiry against other men facing similar charges and who are appearing before a different magistrate, which inquiry was presented also in these proceedings.  Farhan Mohammed Sheikh and Abdulla Aliwi are pleading not guilty. “It’s very obvious that this case shouldn’t have come before me,” the magistrate remarked, rebuking the prosecution for not pointing out this issue as soon as it was informed that she had been assigned the compilation of evidence. Lawyers Antoine Agius Bonnici, Francesco Refalo and Rebekah Spiteri from the Office of the Attorney General are prosecuting, assisted by.

Woman recalls being assaulted by murder suspect as she brushed her teeth,Times of Malta,"A woman has recounted how a man accused of murdering two other people attacked her with a bolt cutter.  Queen OG Bayamma told the court that was in her bathroom brushing her teeth when she was hit on her head, face and arms and knocked down to the ground before her brother burst in and saved her from the aggressor. Bayamma was testifying in the case against Iddrisu Fajsal, a 34-year-old who stands accused of murdering Joseph Bartolo, 73 and Carmen Abela, 56, on October 15, attempting to murder Banyamma and slightly injuring her brother. Bartolo and Abela were found dead at a Marsa farmhouse early that morning. They had been stabbed. Fajsal was arrested shortly after police were called to the scene. The court previously heard that the two deceased victims had converted an old horse-riding school on Triq it-Tigrija in Marsa into living quarters. Bartolo, Abela, Banyamma and Fajsal are all understood to have been living on the property at the time of the attack.  Testifying on Tuesday, Banyamma recalled how Fajsal had burst in on her and started attacking her without reason. “My brother managed to get him out. If he hadn’t, I don’t know what would have happened,” she said. Banyamma’s brother, Ifayeni Ezeh, happened to be at the Marsa farmhouse to visit his sister. He usually lives in Żabbar. Ezeh told the court that he was asleep when he heard a commotion and his sister’s voice. It was dark and before he knew it, he was tangled up in a fight with the accused. He said he did not know the accused, though his face was familiar. As the two fought, three police officers showed up. The officers ordered them to stop fighting, Ezeh testified, but the accused did not. “I asked him why he was trying to kill my sister, and he did not reply,” the witness testified. Ezeh said he eventually managed to get the bolt cutter out of the accused’s hands and tossed it towards the officers. Those three officers, George Attard, Stephen Bonello and Michele Farrugia, also testified on Tuesday. They were told by a civilian that two men were fighting close to Triq December 13. At the time, they were some distance away but could see two black men tussling, the court heard. As soon as they got to the scene, they noticed that one of the men was holding a large pair of “scissors” that were “covered in blood”. Two women close by, who they later learned were relatives of one of the murder victims, were crying. At the time, the officers were not aware that two people had been killed. The shorter of the two men eventually got the shears off the other and tossed them towards the police. The accused then tried to run away and leapt over a padlocked gate. Police forced the gate open and found the accused hiding behind a container. He did not cooperate with police, and he was tasered and then arrested. Defence lawyer Joe Brincat told the court that Bayamma had not presented any medical certificates to prove she had been grievously injured, as she claimed. He objected to the prosecution’s request for the court to order that the man stand trial on indictment, saying evidence presented so far did not justify that. Prosecutors disagreed, saying there was abundant proof linking the accused to the crime. The court, presided by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, is to decree on the prima facie on November 13. Lawyers Joe Brincat and Julia Micallef Stafrace are defence counsel. Inspectors Kurt Zahra and Wayne Camilleri are prosecuting.

Suspected gunman takes hostages in Japan,AFP,"Police were surrounding a post office in Japan late Tuesday as a suspected gunman held at least one person hostage following an apparent shooting at a nearby hospital that wounded two people. TV images showed the suspect, reported to possibly be in his 80s, inside the building with what looked like a gun attached to a cord around his neck in Warabi, outside Tokyo.  His motive was unclear but police believe he was also involved in the incident at the hospital and media reports said that a fire in an apartment block may also be linked.   ""At approximately 2:15 pm today (0515 GMT), a person took hostages and holed up at a post office in Chuo 5-chome area of Warabi city... The perpetrator is possessing what appears to be a gun,"" the city authorities said on their website. ""Citizens near the scene are urged to follow police instructions and evacuate in accordance with police instructions."" Television footage showed a woman in her 20s, believed to have been a hostage, walking out of the post office shortly before 7:30 pm.  It was unclear how many people were still being held but earlier it was reported that a 30-year-old woman was inside. Police were talking to the man by telephone, NTV reported. The Yomiuri daily had reported earlier that around 10 post office staff may be inside the building and that the suspect may be carrying kerosene. Several police cars with flashing lights were situated around the three-storey building as night fell, footage showed.  ""This is a quiet neighbourhood. I can't believe something like this is happening,"" local resident Tetsuo Sasaki, 70, told AFP. ""I used that post office just yesterday,"" said his wife Reiko Sasaki, 64. ""I could have been at the wrong place at the wrong time. I could have been the target."" Earlier at a nearby hospital in Toda, two people were slightly wounded - reportedly a doctor and a patient - after shots were apparently fired from the street into the building. Police ""believe the man was at the hospital and came to the post office"", a city official told AFP. ""After 1:00 pm, I heard a woman shouting 'Someone, please come,' and a nurse told me, 'Stay away from the windows and keep your head low,'"" a man in his 60s who was inside the hospital told broadcaster NHK. ""Around 2:00 pm, I looked inside the doctor's office, and saw a pool of blood next to an examination table. I didn't hear a gunshot. But a nurse said she heard two gunshots,"" the man said. Fuji TV said police were also investigating a possible link between the man and a fire at an apartment building in Toda earlier in the day. No one was injured in the fire, it said. Violent crime is rare in Japan, in part because of strict regulations on gun ownership, but cases still occur. Last year, former former prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead and this April a man hurled an explosive towards current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Kishida was unharmed. The following month, a man holed up in a building after allegedly killing four people, including two police officers and an elderly woman, in a gun and knife attack.

"Suspected drug trafficker contacted witness to stop testimony, court told",Claudia Calleja,"A drug trafficking suspect contacted a witness to stop him from testifying against him, prosecutors told a court on Tuesday in a case that also featured the name of a criminal lawyer. Prosecutors told the court they had recordings of Terence Cini, 38, discussing a pending criminal case of his with Michael John Mugliette, who was in prison at the time. They also said they believe Cini sent lawyer Matthew Xuereb to speak to Mugliette in prison. In the recorded phone calls, presented in court on Tuesday, Cini told Mugliette he would pay a €40,000 fine as well as €7,000 in pending court expenses for him. Mugliette is alleged to have told Cini he would not testify against him.   Mugliette had linked Cini to a drug deal in testimony given under oath in 2020. He was due to testify in the case against Cini on Monday, but when summoned to the witness stand, said he could not remember what he had testified back in 2020. Police immediately arrested Cini on suspicion of attempting to suborn a key witness. Police Inspectors Mark Anthony Mercieca and John Leigh Howard told Magistrate Nadine Lia, who presided over Tuesday’s arraignment, that criminal lawyer Matthew Xuereb’s name had also emerged in the course of their investigations. Xuereb, they told the court, had gone to speak to Mugliette in prison despite the latter having no reason to require a lawyer, as he had no pending criminal cases. When police looked into why the lawyer went to speak to Mugliette, it emerged that Cini told Mugliette that he (Cini) had paid Xuereb. The inspectors said more people might be charged over the case. Sources close to police said Xuereb was called in for questioning. Cini, who is pleading not guilty, was remanded in police custody. Lawyers Franco Debono and Alfred Abela represented Cini.

"'Banging, screaming and silence': Marsa double murder victim's 112 call",Edwina Brincat,"A double murder victim made an emergency 112 call saying she and her partner were being attacked by a man who was still behind the door, a court has heard. Carmen Abela was describing the attacker when there was a sudden banging and screaming followed by silence before the call fell through.  The 9.20am call on October 15 happened seconds before Abela, and her partner Joe Bartolo were killed in an attack allegedly carried out by Iddrisu Faisal, a 34-year-old Ghanaian national who was one of their tenants. When the victim's body was found, she still had her mobile phone clasped in her hand.  Iddrisu had been renting a room at the former old horse-riding school on Triq it-Tigrija, Marsa. The victims had converted the stables into living quarters.  Investigating inspector Kurt Zahra described the call to court when the compilation of evidence proceedings began on Monday before Magistrate Gabriella Vella. Abela’s brother had spoken to the victim shortly before the incident and all appeared “normal"", Zahra told the court. But some month previously, his sister had told him about some issues concerning non-payment of rent by their tenants, without mentioning any names, the relative later told police investigating the double murder.    Another female relative of Bartolo received a call from Carmen Abela at 9.16am, urging them to go to their assistance because “a dark-skinned person had assaulted them.”  Four minutes after that call, she dialled the police emergency number and was just telling the operator that they were being attacked by a ""dark-skinned man"" when there was “banging and screaming and the line suddenly went dead,” Zahra said.  Zahra rushed to the crime scene after information from the control room and the Ħamrun district police flagged the presence of a “knife-wielding man” in the vicinity of Triq it-Tigrija, Marsa, near the old horse-riding school.  When Zahra arrived, Iddrisu had been arrested and was face down on the ground, handcuffed at the back. He was still putting up a struggle even after being tasered, the inspector said. Following the violent attacks, Iddrisu had jumped over a high gate bordering the premises from a service centre next door and when police forced their way through the gate, the suspect resisted arrest.  A police officer suffered facial injuries in the scuffle.  Putting on protective gear so as not to contaminate the crime scene, Zahra then headed to the building where the murders allegedly took place.    A door leading to the victims’ own living quarters was partly smashed.  A woman’s lifeless body was blocking the way.  It was Abela, in green t-shirt and tight black shorts, her feet towards the broken door, her head lying close to an inner brick wall.  There were blood smudges around her and her hand still clasped her mobile phone.   Right next to her, lay Bartolo, face upwards, in a light-blue top and underwear. There was a large gash and a lot of blood over and beneath the man’s body, recalled Zahra.  Inside a bedroom, there were more traces of blood. There were also drops of blood in one of the rented rooms where Zahra also spotted a pink suitcase.  A Nigerian woman, who lived in that room was also attacked by Iddrisu in the early morning rampage, the court heard. The woman later recounted how she had just got up and was brushing her teeth when she was dealt a blow on the back of her head.  She fell to the floor, her screams alerting her brother who rented another room nearby.  He rushed to her assistance just in time to spot their fellow-tenant, Iddrisu, wielding a “large iron rod.” Iddrisu turned upon him, striking him on the head too.  “If you have some issue, take it up with the landlords,” shouted the stunned man, as he grappled with Iddrisu, trying to grasp the weapon.    He finally managed to knock it out of the aggressor’s hands, just as officers from the mounted police headquarters across the road, drove up in their Landrover.  One of the officers grasped the iron item and secured it safely in the police vehicle.  The aggressor was finally arrested as Rapid Intervention Unit police turned up for assistance.  Asked by parte civile lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Franco Debono about the weapon, Zahra described it as a bulky and heavy bolt cutter, “almost a metre long” normally used to cut through metal mesh.  Asked by defence lawyer Joe Brincat whether that instrument had been taken to the murder scene or was already there prior to the incident, Zahra said that that point was still to be determined.  However, eyewitnesses alerted by the banging and screaming had confirmed seeing that weapon in the accused’s hands.  The case continues.  Inspectors Zahra and Wayne Camilleri are prosecuting together with AG lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Ramon Bonett Sladden. Legal aid lawyer Julia Micallef Stafrace is also defence counsel.

Judge turns down bail request by seven men charged with terrorism,Matthew Xuereb,"Seven men, in preventive custody since their arraignment in May over suspicious jihadist activity on social media, have had their request for bail denied by a judge who said there was a real fear that they would try to leave Malta. Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja ruled that the men, who are all Syrian, had no ties with the country and the fear that they would abscond was heightened, especially since they have contacts abroad and know that the proceedings against them would stop if they left. Ajil Al Muhsen, 21, Adnan Maashi, 21, Yazan Abdulaziz, 26, Ahmed Kadas, 25, Khalil Al Hamoud, 21, Ahmed Ahmed, 27 and Mohammed Mohammed, 24, were targeted by police investigations after their social media activity raised suspicion. They were eventually charged with terrorism. The men fled Syria and travelled to Malta in 2017 when Syrian government forces drove out the ISIS terrorist group from the area where they lived. In August 2022, police began to investigate a group of people who published extremist material related to ISIS on their social media accounts, later roping in the European police agency’s assistance in the investigations. On April 29, the seven suspects were rounded up during early morning raids and two days later were charged in court, all pleading not guilty to distributing material aimed at inciting terrorism, recruiting or encouraging third parties to carry out terrorist acts or planning to travel abroad as part of a terrorist plot. During the arraignment, their lawyers did not request bail but filed an application for bail before the criminal court. Their defence lawyers argued that the men currently had pending constitutional proceedings in which they are claiming a breach of their right to a fair hearing since their continued arrest was not reviewed fortnightly in terms of the law. They said the evidence in this case was all documented, including through a magisterial inquiry. The fear of interfering with justice is inexistent, they said. The argument by the prosecution that there was a pending investigation was “fallacious”, they said, adding that many of them have been in Malta for five or six years. The prosecution said that one of the defendants had communicated with a third party to remove the incriminating material. There are videos that show how a bomb could be made in a simple way. Lawyers José Herrera, Franco Debono, Matthew Xuereb, Alexander Scerri Herrera and Martina Herrera were defence counsel.

"Spanish clergy sexually abused over 200,000 children, probe estimates",AFP,"Over 200,000 minors are estimated to have been sexually abused in Spain by the Roman Catholic clergy since 1940, according to an independent commission published Friday. The report did not give a specific figure but said a poll of over 8,000 people found that 0.6% of Spain's adult population of around 39 million people said they had suffered sexual abuse by members of the clergy when they were still children. The percentage rises to 1.13% - or over 400,000 people - when including abuse by lay members, Spain's national ombudsman Angel Gabilondo told a news conference called to present the findings of the report. The revelations in Spain are the latest to rock the Roman Catholic Church after a series of sexual abuse scandals around the world, often involving children, over the past 20 years. But unlike in other nations, in Spain - a traditionally Catholic country that has become highly secular - clerical abuse allegations are only now gaining traction, leading to accusations by survivors of stonewalling. ""Unfortunately, for many years there has been a certain desire to deny abuses or a desire to conceal or protect the abusers,"" said Gabilondo, a former education minister. The report is critical of the attitude of the Catholic Church, calling its response to cases of child abuse involving the clergy ""insufficient"". It recommended the creation of a state fund to pay reparations to victims. Just before the report was presented in parliament, the Spanish bishops conference said it would hold an extraordinary meeting on Monday to discuss its findings. Spain's parliament in March 2022 overwhelmingly approved the creation of an independent commission led by the country's ombudsman to ""shed light"" on allegations of sexual abuse of ""defenceless boys and girls"" within the Catholic Church. Spain's Catholic Church, which for years flatly refused to carry out its own probe, declined to take part in the independent investigation, although it did cooperate by providing documents on cases of sexual abuse that had been collected by dioceses. But as political pressure mounted, it tasked a private law firm in February 2022 with an ""audit"" into past and present sexual abuse by clergy, teachers and others associated with the Church, which should be completed by the end of the year. The Spanish Church said in June it had discovered 927 cases of child abuse through a complaints procedure launched in 2020.  It argues it has set up protocols for dealing with sexual abuse and has set up ""child protection"" offices withing dioceses. But a probe by top-selling daily newspaper El Pais which began in 2018 has since uncovered 2,206 victims and 1,036 alleged abusers dating back to 1927. ""According to experts, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" the newspaper wrote on Friday before the report was published. The Church's abuse crisis exploded onto the international stage in 2002 when the Boston Globe newspaper revealed priests had sexually abused children for decades and church leaders had covered it up. Patterns of widespread abuse of children were later reported across the United States and Europe, in Chile and Australia, undercutting the moral authority of the 1.3 billion-member Church and taking a toll on its membership. An independent commission in neighbouring France concluded in 2021 that some 216,000 children - mostly boys - had been sexually abused by clergy since 1950. In Germany, a study found 3,677 cases of abuse between 1946 and 2014 while in Ireland more than 14,500 people received compensation through a government scheme for those abused at juvenile facilities run by the Catholic Church.

"Man has phone tapped without warrant, claims breach of rights",Edwina Brincat,"A man whose telephone conversations were allegedly tapped by Maltese security services acting without the necessary ministerial warrant is claiming that such illegality breached his fundamental human rights.  Carmelo Occhipinti, an Italian national who has been living in Malta for the past 21 years working primarily in banking and finance, cried foul when an Italian anti-mafia court was presented with evidence that his phone had been tapped for several months.  In August 2019, he handed in his resignation to the banking institution where he had been employed since 2003. His job formally came to an end in February 2020.  But it later emerged that between January and October 2019, Maltese and/or Italian security services had been listening in on calls made or received by Occhipinti on his mobile phone which had a Maltese service provider’s number. Moreover, security services were also listening in on any conversations carried out in the vicinity of his bank clients’ mobile phones whenever the devices were not switched to aeroplane mode.  Such “unequivocal and irrebuttable” evidence emerged through documents which were formally exhibited before the Tribunale di Catania Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia, Occhipinti’s lawyers claim in a judicial protest filed on Friday before the First Hall, Civil Court. Transcripts of those phone conversations forming part of records before the Italian court were “black on white” evidence, making it “blatantly clear” that such intercepts were done without the necessary ministerial warrant.  One of those intercepts concerned a particular call affected during a meeting that took place at the bank’s St Julian’s offices attended by Occhipinti and three or four others. In terms of the Security Services Act, any intercept must be effected under a warrant issued by the relative minister and any information obtained without such authorisation was “automatically illegal”. When the law was being discussed in parliament, the legislator intended to ensure that such powers would be used with “great caution” and only within the ambit of the relative warrant.  Such an approach was purposely designed to safeguard the fundamental rights of every person, including the right to private life in terms of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Occhipinti is now claiming that that right has been breached in his regard and is thus calling upon the Police Commissioner, the MSS (security services) Chief and the State Advocate, holding them responsible for damages and reserving the right to further legal action to protect his rights. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta signed the judicial protest.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"Website impersonating one of two legal cannabis clubs, watchdog warns",Times of Malta,"A website is impersonating one of two legal cannabis clubs, the local watchdog for the responsible use of the drug is warning. The website claims to be owned by the Ta’ Zelli club - an association that, together with KDD Society, has become the first to be granted a licence to legally grow and sell cannabis. They were granted the licences this month. On Friday, the Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis warned on Facebook that ""unknown third parties were attempting to impersonate one of the associations granted an operating permit"".   ""We remind prospective members that the only approved associations are those found on our website.""   The two associations plan to be able to distribute cannabis legally by the beginning of 2024.   RELATED STORIES  Under the rules, members will have to pay a small fee to be part of an association following an introductory interview. At the interview, applicants will be queried about their cannabis use but will also be informed about how they can contribute to the community alongside informing them of their responsibilities as a prospective member. Leonid McKay, head of the ARUC said it did not plan to control prices but expected that they would compete with any on the black market.   Four other associations have been given an ""in-principle"" licence to operate. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Car dealers charged with tampering mileage of 450 Japan imports,Edwina Brincat,"The owners of two car dealerships have denied tampering with the mileage of more than 450 cars they imported from Japan. Roderick and Alison Vella, 46 and 47 respectively, from Żabbar and Alexander Spiteri, 48 from Mellieħa all pleaded not guilty to money laundering, fraud and criminal conspiracy when they appeared in court on Thursday. The court heard a Transport Malta (TM) investigation found that cars sold by Alexander Auto Dealer owned by  Spiteri, and Rokku Auto Dealer, owned by the Vellas, were found to have had their mileage rolled back by up to 110,000 kilometres.  Pierre Montebello, TM chief officer, testified that investigations into the suspected odometer fraud were triggered by a whistleblower who turned up at the authority's reception on May 2, 2022.  He was put through to TM official David Caruana within the Land Transport Directorate and told him there was tampering with Japan-imported vehicles.  A sample of Japan-imported vehicles along with relative documentation were scrutinized.  Officials checked the Jevic certificate - a physical document issued and sent with the vehicle after it had been inspected in Japan before being exported to Malta.  The details on that certificate were compared to the VH005 form- a document that used to be filled in by police but is now handled by TM officials, Montebello explained. The vehicle details on those two documents matched, but when they visited the Japanese website where all relative Jevic certificates were uploaded, discrepancies emerged.  For instance, one vehicle had a mileage of 97,000 km on the physical Jevic certificate, but that figure on the website was 202,000 km, Montebello told the court. Another vehicle had a reading of 85,000km on the physical document and 195,000km on the relative website copy.  Prior to the whistleblower’s report, TM used to carry out random checks on a relatively small sample of imported vehicles.  “Until then we had never sensed anything wrong. But when the whistleblower gave us that tip-off, we took a larger sample and checked the Jevic certificate on the website. That’s where the discrepancy emerged,"" Montebello said.    When comparing the documents, they discovered 301 vehicles with discrepancies in odometer readings. As internal checks continued, an additional 150 vehicles or so came to light.  And when the focus turned to the importers, two particular names - Rokku and Alexander Auto Dealer - stood out, said Montebello.   RELATED STORIES  Since the suspected fraud surfaced, the system of checks adopted by TM has changed, he added. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Franco Debono, Montebello said that the Jevic certificate that reached the transport authority presented all the features of a genuine document and matched VH005 form.  “It was the Jevic online that did not.” Once the vehicles entered the Maltese port, police would inspect them to confirm that the vehicle and its relative documentation matched.  Importer details under Section A of the form were filled in by the importer or dealer himself while Section B of the form, concerning make, model, category, colour, engine code “etc, were filled in by police,” said Montebello.  “That form states ‘odometer reading’ too,” pointed out the defence.  “Yes,” said the witness, confirming that all those Section B details were filled in by the police.  “In whose presence?” pressed Debono. “We had no idea….I cannot tell what the police did.”  Asked by Debono how the police would physically fill in the details on the VH form, particularly with respect to the odometer reading, Montebello said that the officer would switch on the car ignition, check the reading and input the figure on the relative form.  The physical Jevic certificate would accompany the vehicle from abroad.  Asked about the lapse of time between the arrival of the imports in Malta and their consignment to the dealers, the witness said that it was usually a short interval.  Dealers incur charges while the vehicles are kept under the custody of port authorities and therefore are usually released to dealers within a week or so.  The court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, upheld the prosecution’s request for a freezing order over all assets of the accused. The case continues in November. AG lawyers Marthese Ellul Grech and Etienne Savona prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Jason Azzopardi are defence counsel.

Priest in sex abuse scandal joins Slovenian diocese,AFP,"A priest and world-renowned mosaic artist accused of sexual and psychological abuse has joined a Slovenian diocese after being expelled in June from the Catholic Jesuit order, officials said Thursday. Slovenian Marko Rupnik was sanctioned by The Catholic order of Jesuits - to which Pope Francis belongs - twice over claims of abuse against members of a community of adult religious women in Slovenia in the early 1990s. He is the artist who created the mosaics adorning the entrance to the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary in Gozo.  RELATED STORIES  Dating from the mid-1980s to 2018, they include complaints of spiritual and psychological abuse as well as sexual harassment, including from within the Slovenian community and an artistic centre in Rome. Rupnik, 68, ""was accepted into the diocese of Koper in August"", said the diocese in the Adriatic port city in a statement on Thursday. The decision was made at his request and because he has not been convicted of any offences, the diocese added. ""As long as he hasn't been sanctioned by a court of law, he'll benefit from the same rights and duties as all other priests,"" it said. The Catholic order of Jesuits announce his expulsion in June, ""due to his obstinate refusal to observe the vow of obedience."" ""From the moment he is no longer a Jesuit, he becomes a diocesan priest said a source told AFP in Rome, saying they did not know whether the Vatican was ""aware"". ""Since he is subject to a conviction, the bishop can decide to accept him,"" the source added. The Jesuits - one of the main Roman Catholic orders, founded in 1540 - also revealed last year that Rupnik had been briefly excommunicated in 2020 for absolving someone for having sexual relations with him. He was reinstated after he acknowledged his wrongdoing and formally repented, the order said. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Children's Commissioner alarmed by video of girl being punched and kicked,Times of Malta,"A video clip of a teenage girl being bullied and beaten in public in Valletta has sparked concern within the Office of the Commissioner for Children. In a statement on Thursday morning, the commissioner’s office urged authorities to step in to ensure the girl is given all the necessary support. It said it was also concerned to see the video being uploaded online, viewed by many and reproduced in the media. That could cause the victim to be re-traumatised and negatively impact others, too, it said. The video showed a gang of girls punching and kicking a girl on the ground close to Hastings Garden in Valletta. Police told Times of Malta they were aware of the incident and are investigating it. Times of Malta was also sent other videos of violent clashes between young people within the capital city over the weekend. The Office of the Commissioner for Children said more work needed to be done to instil empathy in children.  Children must also be taught not to be bystanders and to seek help when facing such situations, the office said. Violence involving youths is on the rise in Valletta, with several reports of such incidents being made public in recent months. After one such assault, which left a 15-year-old with a broken arm, Prime Minister Robert Abela said he no longer felt comfortable letting his daughter roam the streets of Valletta alone and wanted the courts to come down harshly on such criminals.

"Jobless man who lives in container denied bail over car arson, theft",Edwina Brincat,"A jobless man living in a container and identified as the suspect who allegedly set fire to a parked vehicle in Santa Lucia was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty upon arraignment on Wednesday.  Charlot Camilleri, 41, was also charged with  copper thefts from a factory between August and September. He was tracked down following a report about a Toyota Vitz that was set on fire in Triq il-Ġnien, Santa Lucia on October 16 at night. The Toyota was written off as a total loss and the fire also damaged two other vehicles parked nearby - a Peugeot Partner van and a Toyota Aygo. CCTV footage from the suspected crime scene placed investigators on the track of the person who was seen throwing a plastic bottle under one of the car tyres, then stepping back and flinging a lighter. He then fled the scene.  Although the route to Żejtun, taken by the suspect, was traced through footage, police could not identify him.  A still from that footage was forwarded to the Żejtun police. It turned out that the district officers were investigating a series of copper thefts from a factory at the Bulebel Industrial Estate.  On Tuesday, the suspect was tracked down in the vicinity of the container that was his home.  On Wednesday, he was charged with aggravated theft, wilful damage to third-party property, wilfully setting the car on fire and leading a vagrant and idle life.  He pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody.  His lawyer, Wilfred Buttigieg, made no request for bail.  The court, presided over by Magistrate Joseph Mifsud, urged the accused to seek help. He was also urged to give police information about “the coward” who most likely got him to commit the arson, added the court.  Inspectors Antonello Magro, Mario Xiberras, Doriette Cuschieri and AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Five Colombians to be repatriated over false lease agreements,Edwina Brincat,"Five Colombians who admitted to presenting false lease agreements to Identity Malta to secure a residence permit were on Wednesday handed a suspended sentence by a court that also ordered their repatriation.  The four men and a woman were escorted to court after police investigations confirmed that the documents presented to the state entity were false.  “It was the only way they could secure a residence permit but the illegality happened nonetheless,” said prosecuting Inspector Jonathan Ransley.  Officials at Identita’- formerly Identity Malta - grew suspicious when presented with the lease agreements which all appeared to carry the same address. Further investigations proved their suspicions right.  The ‘lessees’ had found someone willing to prepare a false rent agreement in their name. Some of them had been living in Malta for years.  After consulting their lawyers, Anderson Pedroza Gutierrez, Carlos Andres Angarita Contreras, Henrique Santos Silva, Jose Ricardo Vanegas Bustamante and Ana Maria Rodriquez Barragan registered an admission to making a false declaration to derive a benefit, as well as forgery of the document presented to Identity Malta. When delivering judgment, Magistrate Joseph Mifsud said the court had pondered on the appropriate punishment and, given the circumstances, deemed imprisonment not appropriate neither for the State nor the taxpayer who would shoulder the burden.  These accused were “victims” of greedy individuals who, besides exploiting such people, did not pay their taxes. The court urged the police to continue to investigate so as to trace these “heartless persons, who lacked a conscience and robbed society”. The prosecution assured the court that investigations were ongoing.  The court said it had nothing against those who worked and earned a decent living but slammed the exploitation of people like the accused, who had to resort to illegal means to be able to live in Malta. Each of the five was condemned to a six-month jail term suspended for two years.  The court also ordered their repatriation.  Inspectors Jonathan Ransley and Eman Hayman prosecuted.

It was all made up: prison warder cleared of raping underage inmate,Edwina Brincat,"A prison warder has been cleared of raping an underage inmate five years ago after a court concluded that the minor and her friend had made up the story out of spite because “they knew no better”. Joseph Zammit’s ordeal began in November 2022 when he was charged with raping the then-15-year-old minor, an inmate at the female division in the youth section of the Corradino Correctional Facility. The girl had first told a fellow inmate about the warder’s unwelcome advances and sexually loaded comments, later even speaking to a Caritas official. Her claims resulted in an internal inquiry against the then-52-year-old father whose career at the prison facility spanned 23 years. He was subsequently charged with a raft of offences including sexual activity with the minor, harassing the minor and her friend, seeking sexual favours and engaging in acts of sexual intimacy, which offences he was duty bound to prevent. He pleaded not guilty upon arraignment and protested his innocence ever since, testifying in the proceedings rather than opt for silence. The girl had claimed that Zammit used to comment about her figure while she was showering and described how she had oral sex with him some six or seven times. She also supplied details about the rape, which she claimed took place inside a washroom. Her friend also insisted that the accused would comment about her breasts and turn up while she was showering. She mentioned a foreign inmate at the youth section who allegedly had a soft spot for Zammit and who used to tell that teen that he was divorced. However, a very different picture emerged when the accused’s colleagues testified. They said that Zammit was an “exemplary” man, assigned to carry out maintenance jobs at the youth section. He would visit twice a week or so and would always seek admission when called to carry out some task at the female section, always working in the presence of a female official. When weighing both versions, Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit concluded that the prosecution did not manage to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The versions supplied by the minors were not credible. The criminal wrongdoing attributed to the accused would have not likely been committed without rousing suspicion of fellow prison guards, said the court, observing that the section was well-monitored by CCTV cameras. One of those devices was mounted close to the washroom where the rape allegedly took place. Yet, the prosecution did not even seek to preserve that footage and produce it in evidence. One of the minors, almost 16 years old, had a vast criminal record marked by offences against public officials, theft and injuries against the person. She was familiar with court proceedings. She threatened male officers that she would do to them like she did to Zammit when she was prosecuted and then threatened a female warder that she would lose her kids. Her words reflected her “cunning” character. She chose her words well. When all was considered, the court was convinced that the two girls had made up the story to reach their targets or out of spite “because, unfortunately, they knew no better”. The accused’s version was more credible and, in light of all evidence, the court pronounced an acquittal. Lawyers Franco Debono and Herman Mula were defence counsel.

Man who masterminded arson attack 12 years ago gets six and half-years in prison,Edwina Brincat,"A man who instructed a drug addict to set fire to the door of a Qormi home 12 years ago was condemned to six and a half years in jail after being found guilty of complicity in the arson.  Justice caught up with Keith Camilleri when, years after the incident, his accomplice name-dropped him to the police, supplying a detailed account of events that August day in 2011.  The two men had met at the detox centre while they were both struggling with drug addiction.  Later that afternoon at around 3.15 pm, a police constable stationed in Qormi caught sight of a person slipping behind a bamboo curtain hanging outside the front door of a private residence in St Francis Street.  The person seemed to be holding some sort of cloth.  Then suddenly, the curtain burst into flames just as a male figure fled the scene, with the policeman giving chase.  The officer managed to catch up with the suspect, Mario Martin Baldacchino, who was also in possession of a lighter.  He was arrested and was subsequently charged with arson. Baldacchino was eventually convicted of the crime and was handed a six-year term of imprisonment.  Baldacchino hinted he had more to say to the police shortly after his arrest, but he only named Camilleri as the person who ordered the arson five years after the fact. Baldacchino testified against the alleged mastermind after his case was finalised and he was already serving his sentence. He recounted how that day, Camilleri had offered him a lift home from the detox centre and along the way had asked him to set fire to the door of a private residence. Camilleri drove past that residence, pointed it out to Baldacchino and handed him a container of petrol before dropping him off in the vicinity.  Camilleri, nicknamed ‘Holy Ghost’, had promised him €500 in return, but that money never materialized, Baldacchino explained. Camilleri had “manipulated” him, knowing very well about his drug addiction at the time.  Since he was under the influence of drugs, he could not run too fast and that was why the police officer had caught him in the act.  Baldacchino’s version was deemed credible by the court which also noted his attitude at the witness stand, his account consistent throughout, down to the least detail.  Moreover, the prosecution had produced circumstantial evidence which further corroborated that version of events.  Just minutes before the fire broke out, Camilleri was involved in a traffic collision just a kilometre or so away from the crime scene.  Court experts reported that the damage to the door amounted to €1600. An arson expert confirmed that a piece of cloth soaked in fuel had been set alight and placed next to the door. Luckily, since the door was fire-resistant, the fuel had not seeped indoors and the flames did not make their way into the home.  At the time of the arson, the three occupants of the house were on the rooftop with two workmen.  The prosecution also proved the charge of recidivism.  Camilleri has four previous convictions which attested to the “life of crime” he had been accustomed to at the time and no evidence was produced to show that he had changed his ways, observed the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.  When all was considered the court found him guilty of all charges except for complicity in the wilful damage to third party property and condemned him to six and a half years imprisonment. The court also placed him under a three-year restraining order and ordered him to reimburse the victims €1600 within six months.  Inspectors Mario Xiberras and Jeffrey Scicluna prosecuted.

Prosecution of former top police officer suspected of corruption stalls,Jacob Borg,"A former top police officer suspected of corruption with murder suspect Yorgen Fenech has yet to be prosecuted. Ray Aquilina, the former head of the police’s anti-money laundering unit, was arrested in April 2021. The arrest formed part of a wider probe into police and government officials who potentially leaked sensitive information to suspects in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation. Times of Malta had reported in 2021 how investigators felt there were grounds to prosecute Aquilina. However, an official familiar with the probe said a decision was taken to delay any prosecutions until after the magisterial inquiry into the leaks has been concluded. The police are empowered to act independently of such inquiries. As part of the leaks probe, investigators zoomed in on the planned sale of a Birżebbuġa apartment to Aquilina, that Fenech was suspected of facilitating. At that stage, Aquilina was meant to be investigating Fenech over his ownership of 17 Black, a secret company suspected to have been intended to funnel payments to former government officials Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri. Instead of Aquilina appearing as the property buyer, the property transaction was to be fronted by his parents, who would then donate it to their son. Documents reviewed by Times of Malta indicate that Aquilina had claimed he was not buying the property directly himself as he was undergoing separation proceedings with his wife, and therefore did not want the property to form part of their joint assets. Aquilina had claimed during the sale process that the property acquisition was being funded through his personal savings. The former police officer’s relationship with Fenech came under scrutiny soon after the arrest of self-confessed murder middleman Melvin Theuma in November 2019. Theuma was arrested as part of a money laundering operation that was used as a guise to obtain recordings the murder middleman secretly took with Fenech. According to court testimony, messages exchanged between Fenech and Theuma in the days and hours leading up to the middleman’s arrest indicated the pair knew the planned money laundering raids were just a guise for the police to obtain the recordings. As Theuma became increasingly nervous about his impending arrest, Fenech had assured him that “Ray”, understood to be a reference to Aquilina, was going to be handling the arrest. Soon after retiring from the police force, Aquilina was appointed as a manager within Enemalta’s internal audit and governance section. He no longer occupies the role. The magisterial inquiry into the leaks has been open for close to four years. Keith Schembri, the right-hand man of former prime minister Joseph Muscat, featured as one of the suspects in the inquiry, along with ex-police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar and ex-deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta. All concerned deny wrongdoing. Fenech is set to face a trial over his alleged role in commissioning the murder. He denies masterminding the October 2017 assassination, with his lawyers last week suggesting that Schembri is the murder mastermind.

Three more men in court following inquiry into terrorism activity in Malta,Edwina Brincat,"Three Syrian men tracked down following a magisterial inquiry into reports of terrorism-related activity, were on Friday charged with money laundering, involvement in a criminal organisation and sharing of terrorist material. One of the men, who faced the lesser charges of money laundering, was granted bail against a hefty deposit of €40,000 and a personal guarantee of €80,000. The other two were remanded in custody. The three men were arraigned in relation to an inquiry that earlier this year led to seven other arraignments of suspects who shared terrorist-related material. That inquiry had been closed and then re-opened. It was currently ongoing, AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici told court. The first to be arraigned on Friday - Syrian national Ebrahem Ahmad, 35 - was charged with money laundering, operating banking services without a licence and involvement in a criminal organisation.  RELATED STORIES  The plasterer, who lives in Pieta', pleaded not guilty.  When his lawyers requested bail, the prosecution objected saying investigations were ongoing and some 30 other people were still to be questioned.  But that objection prompted a strong rebuttal by the defence and a stern reaction by the court.  ""The accused was on police bail for some six months and there was no issue. Now that he's been arraigned, you're saying that he might approach witnesses,"" argued lawyer Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea.  The investigation was still ongoing, countered the prosecution.  ""I cannot bear to hear this objection - that 'the investigation is ongoing' - any longer. I wish you'd come with some better justification, ""observed Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit.  ""By now you should be aware of the arguments raised by the defence to counter such an objection,"" she added. The man was granted bail on condition of not approaching prosecution witnesses, especially civilians, signing the bail book daily, respect a curfew between 11pm and 6am, a deposit of €40,000 and a personal guarantee of €80,000.   The other two men were arraigned jointly and were charged with sharing terrorist material.  Farhan Mohammed Sheikh, 29, from Ħamrun and Abdullah Aliwi, 23, from Paola pleaded not guilty. The plasterers are both Syrian nationals. Defence lawyer Jose' Herrera started off by noting that these arraignments stemmed from one magisterial inquiry.  The charges were not the same but the same arguments applied. His argument was backed by defence lawyer Franco Debono.  The case of the other seven Syrians currently undergoing criminal proceedings had been highly publicised.  These two other co-accused were out on police bail and had all the time to approach witnesses and tamper. AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici rebutted that ""the situation [of the two accused] is totally different"" to that of Ahmad's.  ""You cannot compare. These are facing terrorism charges. You cannot compare money laundering to terrorism charges,"" he said. Terrorism-related charges have a possible maximum punishment of life imprisonment.  Their arraignment, he added, formed part of a global operation against terrorism.  Besides the gravity of the crimes, there was also the fear of tampering, Agius Bonnici said, adding that even from within prison, there were people who had reached out to prosecution witnesses, ensured that some mobile data was cancelled and alerted suspects abroad not to come to Malta. Others had been told what to say if questioned.  Moreover, these two had travelled to Malta illegally, he said. While one was sent to Greece, he had returned to Malta.  EU law made it clear that those who promote terrorism were to face the same punishment as those who committed terrorist acts, he said, adding that such crimes impacted the whole population.  There was a public interest and a concern for national security, stressed the prosecutor. Herrera meanwhile noted that the two accused had simply received material on their devices and had not shared it.  Their case, lawyer Matthew Xuereb added, was less complex than the money-laundering charges and cross-border activities by Ahmad who had been granted bail. Debono put forward another argument: although the prosecution spoke in terms of the maximum punishment related to these charges, the actual punishment could well be much less.  After hearing submissions the court turned down the request for bail in light of the very serious nature of the charges, to safeguard public order and national security and in light of the risk of other possible future crimes.  There was also the risk of absconding, further enhanced by the fact that the charges carried a heavier punishment. AG lawyers Francesco Refalo and Rebekah Spiteri also prosecuted together with Inspector Jean Paul Attard, Zachary Zammit and Keith Mallan.  Lawyer Mario Mifsud was also defence counsel in the first arraignment while Martina Herrera was also defence counsel in the second arraignment.

Cab driver who took hold-up suspects to Żurrieq jeweller recalls 'weird feeling',Edwina Brincat,"Updated 8.30pm A cab driver who drove three people from Żebbuġ to Żurrieq, where they allegedly robbed a jeweller and beat him up, described a ""weird feeling"" that crept over him during that trip.  The Greek national took the witness stand on Friday when proceedings continued against Donna Borg Sciberras, 29, Mohamed Anas Boualam, 37 and Zuhair Hadoumi, 26, who are pleading not guilty to that violent robbery that left jeweller Joseph Carabott “worse than dead”. The witness, a self-employed taxi driver, identified all three accused as the passengers he picked up from a  Żebbuġ residence on August 25 evening. They booked the ride through Bolt.  He picked them up shortly after 6pm and dropped them off close to the Żurrieq church, on Dun Ġużepp Zammit Street, at 6.36pm.  During that ride, Borg Sciberras sat next to him, while the men sat at the back.  “They spoke another language. So I didn't understand what they were saying,” explained the driver, adding he did recall the woman telling him they were headed to Żurrieq to pick up her seven-year-old son.  “But I had mixed feelings… The way the two gentlemen at the back were looking at me made me feel weird.”  Shortly after that trip, he received an “urgent” call from the police headquarters in Floriana. The investigating officer there explained that the police were working on a “really, really serious crime” and asked him for all the details he could supply about that trip.  The driver told them all he knew, also providing footage from his dashcam which proved important in helping the police identify two of the suspects: Borg Sciberras and Anas.  The third suspect had still not been identified, even though his face was visible on the footage, including that retrieved from the robbery scene and the suspects’ pick-up point at Blue Grotto Avenue.  The following Sunday, police officers looking through CCTV footage identified the third suspect as Hadoumi. His address was traced to a residence in Manuel Dimech Street, Sliema.  That was where police rounded up and arrested the suspect trio, said Inspector Jonathan Cassar from the Drug Squad.  When police knocked at the door of the residence, they suddenly heard a glass drop and footsteps. A police sergeant from the Criminal Investigation Department, who had assisted in the arrests, told court they had forced their way in.  The officers headed upstairs onto the roof where they caught sight of two men running across the rooftops of neighbouring properties.  As they gave chase, something caught the sergeant’s attention and he found Borg Sciberras hiding on the roof.  He handed over her arrest to a colleague and proceeded to assist the other officers in chasing the two male suspects. They were tracked down inside an abandoned property whose rooftop door was open.  The police searched Hadoumi's property. In one room on the first floor, they found two black bags and a mobile phone. Another bag on a bedside table contained a pouch, a gold cross, a small price tag, another mobile phone and documents. The police also found cash and another bag containing two watches.  They discovered a black bag behind some pieces of wood tucked in the space below the stairs leading to the roof. That bag appeared to be the same one that Borg Sciberras was carrying when she walked out of the Żurrieq jewellery shop.  The bag was full of gold items.  Another officer from the Major Crimes Unit testified about his involvement in the search at the  Żebbuġ residence: the point of departure and of return of the suspects on the day of the robbery.   The suspects were not present when the police arrived at the house, but an Egyptian man who rented a room at the house explained that Anas was his housemate.  The man led the officers to his room where they found cannabis and ecstasy pills.  The man is currently facing separate drug-related charges and is under preventive arrest.  Inside the room shared by Anas and Borg Sciberras, besides a small white price tag, a pair of studded earrings and a mobile phone lying on the bed, the police also found a grey zip-up jacket with black and white sleeves.  It matched the one that Borg Sciberras had put on after the robbery as she left Blue Grotto Avenue in another cab, together with her alleged accomplices.  That jacket, along with other items seized from the  Żebbuġ property, were exhibited as evidence. One of those items was a blue file, labeled ‘Anas,’ which contained the accused’s birth certificate, payslips, vehicle documents and other personal papers.  Following the trio’s arrests, Hadoumi led police to a shaft inside the Żebbuġ residence where he had disposed of a knife. Its handle had been used to strike the victim during the robbery.  Anas had been carrying another knife but Hadoumi did not know anything about its whereabouts.  He also told police that after the robbery they had changed their clothes and put them in garbage bags opposite the house.  The bags were not there when police searched for them. The case, presided over by Magistrate Ian Farrugia, continues. AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett prosecuted together with inspectors Shaun Pawney and Jonathan Cassar. Lawyers Mark Mifsud Cutajar, Maria Karlsson and Brandon Kirk Muscat were defence counsel. Lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Ana Thomas appeared parte civile.

MUMN says it ‘never interfered with treatment of Abner Aquilina’,Claudia Calleja,"The nurses’ union never interfered with the treatment of prisoner Abner Aquilina but merely requested a police presence for safety reasons, union chief Paul Pace has said. Pace was reacting to comments made by Aquilina’s defence lawyer Mario Mifsud in court last week. The lawyer claimed Aquilina was sent back to prison because he was being treated inhumanely and kept locked in a room at Mount Carmel Hospital for 23 hours a day.  He argued it was “the first time in Malta’s history” that a union decided how a patient at the mental hospital was to be treated, rendering a magistrate’s decision to move him there ineffective.  Mifsud’s comments followed an instruction by the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses for members to abandon their ward if Aquilina was moved there.  Aquilina, who has now been transferred to the Corradino Correctional Facility, is pleading not guilty to strangling and murdering 29-year-old Polish student Paulina Dembska on January 2, 2022.  Following his arraignment over the murder, Aquilina was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty.     When the compilation of evidence started, Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia raised the issue of insanity and appointed three psychiatrists to assess the accused’s mental state.  In June last year, experts reported that Aquilina was insane at the time of the offence. The magistrate ordered that he was to be detained at Mount Carmel Hospital.    That order could only be reversed upon a subsequent report by three psychiatrists declaring that he could be discharged from hospital.  However, two months after the magistrate’s order, the hospital’s CEO Stephanie Xuereb filed an application before the Criminal Court requesting that Aquilina be transferred to the hospital’s Forensic Unit.  The unit is classified as a prison and is under the sole control of the prisons’ director. Xuereb argued that the hospital had no licence to care for inmates with mental health problems, and that these were to be handled at the Forensic Unit.  That request was upheld by a judge in the superior court and the transfer took place.  Aquilina’s lawyers then filed an application requesting the Magistrates’ Court to reverse the judge’s decision. They argued that whereas in hospital Aquilina was receiving adequate treatment and was marking progress, his situation changed when he ended up at the unit, which was a “halfway” arrangement between a fully equipped hospital ward and a prison. About a month ago, Magistrate Farrugia upheld the defence’s request and ordered Aquilina back to the hospital, the only place where he could lawfully be held at that stage.  He was detained at the Multi-Purpose Unit, which consists of single rooms where patients are kept until they can be moved to other wards. This promoted a complaint from the nurses’ union, which said the unit was not equipped to handle patients like Aquilina and requested constant police backup.  In the absence of police protection, the union ordered its members to abandon the ward they were in if Aquilina was moved there.  Two police officers were eventually assigned to Aquilina but following his lawyer’s complaint, he was transferred to Division 5 at the Corradino Correctional Facility last week.

Woman who rang magistrate gets a telling off in court,Times of Malta,"A woman who rang up a magistrate hearing a case against her relative received a very public telling-off in court on Monday morning. Magistrate Ian Farrugia noted that he had received a call from a relative of Leonvic Fenech, who stands accused of assaulting a neighbour who asked for a car blocking his garage to be moved. Farrugia said the relative used to be a client of his when he was a lawyer, before he became a magistrate, and that he hung up as soon as he realised who he was speaking to. He rebuked the woman, who was seated in the courtroom, in strong terms and told her that while he was letting her off with a warning, he would not be so lenient if it were to happen again. The woman appeared contrite and apologised to the court. Lawyers representing the prosecution, defence and parte civile all placed it on the court record that they have full faith in the magistrate and want him to continue hearing the case. Fenech, a 23-year-old tow truck driver from Santa Venera, faces charges of grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving in relation to the October 7, 7am incident. On Monday, the courtroom heard from Fenech’s alleged victim, who testified that he had rung Fenech’s doorbell after finding a car parked in front of his garage. This was a regular occurrence and it did not overly bother him, he said. He said that Fenech had opened the door and told him that he did not know who owned the car blocking his garage. The victim however insisted that it belonged to someone living in Fenech’s home. Fenech is then alleged to have shoved the victim, told him to “leave me alone so I can sleep” and then attacked him with an iron bar used to lever a hydraulic jack.  He was hit on his right leg, causing him grievous injuries. The commotion prompted a small crowd to gather, the victim said, and Fenech had then hopped into his tow truck and driven off, only to return and attempt to run him over. The victim said he had jumped into a recessed doorway to avoid being hit by the truck. Some time later, police arrived and Fenech was placed under arrest. The victim told the court that he believed the car blocking his garage belonged to a relative of Fenech’s who was present in the courtroom. Upon hearing this, the magistrate asked the witness to identify the man. He then summoned the car owner to the bench and gave him a dressing down and said parking in front of a person’s garage and then being reluctant to move the car was behaviour more fitting for the “Stone Age”. At the end of his testimony, the victim told the court that he did not want his neighbour to be unduly punished and just wanted to go back to having a good relationship with Fenech. Fenech requested bail and the court agreed to that request, subject to him posting a €1,000 deposit and a €2,000 personal guarantee, and signing a bail book on a weekly basis. Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa prosecuted, assisted by prosecutor Rebekah Spiteri. Lawyers Ishmael Psaila and Roberto Spiteri are defence counsel. Lawyer Franco Debono is appearing parte civile.

"Today's front pages – October 16, 2023",Times of Malta,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Monday. All newspapers lead with news about a double murder that took place on Sunday in Triq it-Tiġrija, Marsa. Joe Bartolo known as il-Babakku, 73, and his 56-year-old partner Carmen Abela were killed in a garage.  Times of Malta also reports that Jamie Vella, who is facing criminal proceedings over his alleged involvement in two murders has demanded the recusal of presiding judge Edwina Grima because she has already heard the trial of one of the co-accused in the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop.  The Malta Independent and L-orizzont meanwhile refer to Prime Minister Robert Abela's comments on Sunday that the minimum wage should increase. In-Nazzjon on the other hand refers to comments by PN leader Bernard Grech, who on Sunday said COLA should be tax-free.

EPPO chief wants Malta police to do more to support major fraud probes,Jacob Borg,"More police resources need to be dedicated to helping investigations into major fraud cases impacting the EU’s budgetary interests, the chief prosecutor has advised Malta. Laura Kövesi, who heads the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), was in Malta last week for talks on the problem with the Justice Ministry and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa. In comments to Times of Malta, Kövesi said that while detection and reporting of potential cases has improved, EPPO’s two Maltese prosecutors needed more police support to handle their investigations. “I came here to discuss a plan to develop this further. It is important to be consistent and efficient. Yes, the level of crime detection has increased, but this should not be random or because I came and criticised the authorities,” Kövesi said. Two years ago, Kovesi had stiff words about the way Maltese investigators passed the buck on who was responsible for probing EU fraud cases. Kövesi said that while the situation has improved, she gets a sense that police still draw a distinction between their cases and EPPO cases. “EPPO is not a foreign institution. I fear there is a distinction between ‘their cases and our cases’. No, EPPO is embedded in Malta. The two delegated prosecutors work here and prosecute cases in the Maltese court,” Kövesi said. She said that while there are “a few” police officials who have been officially designated to work on EPPO cases, this has to be done while the same officers juggle their own caseloads in parallel. “This problem with the resources should not be so complicated. I can understand there are not enough police officers, but the idea is to have a plan and establish how to deal with this”. It is important that the EPPO team is not left alone, she added. She said some other countries have gone for a model where police officers are embedded full-time within the local EPPO office. The chief EU prosecutor argued that EPPO is the best possible tool to ensure countries have bigger budgets and more resources available to them, as its main role is to detect VAT and customs fraud. “The last estimates put VAT fraud at €50 billion, year after year, for decades. With EPPO, you can reduce that gap, and if we do that, it means more money in governments’ pockets. “In two years of operations, we have seized €700 million, money that will go directly back to the budgets of EU member states. If we seize a lot of money in Malta, this money will go back into the Maltese budget.” Kövesi also pointed out flaws in the way Malta legislators had adopted the EU’s regulations governing EPPO’s functions. The situation has seen EPPO investigators effectively locked out of magisterial inquiries, which take place in secret. “Our delegated prosecutors must lead the investigation, not the magistrate. It is in the regulations,” Kövesi said. Times of Malta revealed last year how an EPPO probe into the €40 million Marsa junction project faced obstacles, as both the police and an inquiring magistrate refused to hand over data from murder suspect Yorgen Fenech’s phone. Fenech was promised €2 million in success fees for helping a Turkish bidder on the verge of bankruptcy win the Marsa bid. Kövesi said the authorities have told her amendments to the law have been presented to parliament. EPPO publicly highlighted these “implementation gaps” in March. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard presented a draft law to increase EPPO’s power in December 2022, only to withdraw the bill from parliament the following month. Kövesi said collaboration between EPPO and the police had led to arrests in a “complex case” involving many suspects. In July, EPPO announced that eight people had been arrested in connection with customs fraud and corruption of public officials. Investigators suspect a fraudulent scheme designed to evade the payment of customs taxes and duties on the importation of clothing and other goods from China, by under-declaring their value and weight. The scheme is suspected to run into the millions of euros. Kövesi said the scale of the case, which involves lots of connections and transactions with other countries, was a difficult one to investigate. She acknowledged how the police had helped a lot on this particular investigation. “We also have other cases, and just two prosecutors to work on them. That means there need to be more police to support them, as all cases need to be worked on”, she said. She said that while the case in question was a big one for Malta, it was still “only one case”.

"Mental health crisis: just four child psychiatrists seeing 1,000 clients each",Mark Laurence Zammit,"Child psychiatrists are warning that thousands of children with mental health problems are falling through the cracks of a system that does not have enough therapists to keep up with the demand. Around 16,000 children and adolescents in Malta demonstrate symptoms of mental health problems, an ongoing study has revealed, and 15 per cent of them meet the criteria to be diagnosed with a mental disorder. Child psychiatrists Nigel Camilleri and Rosemarie Sacco told Times of Malta there are not enough professionals to deal with the demand and the government is doing very little to mitigate the situation. “There are just four child and adolescent psychiatrists in Malta and we have around 1,000 clients each at any one time,” Camilleri said on World Mental Health Day. “Ideally, we see each client every two weeks but with the caseload we have that’s impossible. I have an eight-month waiting list of new patients. In comparison, our counterparts in the UK have some 100 clients each at any one time.”   He said the Association of Child and Adolescent Mental Health had flagged the issue several times with the government, but there was no “genuine investment”. Child mental health services continued to suffer from insufficient staff, lack of training and inadequate and dilapidated facilities at St Luke’s Hospital, where the department is based. “Lime plaster falls off the walls, the furniture is old and mismatched, plumb­ing is poor… we’ve had teenage patients ask us why they are forced to receive treatment in such an ugly environment,” Camilleri said.   The association, of which Sacco and Camilleri are the president and the social policy officers respectively, is currently leading research which has shown that two out of every five children and adolescents aged between five and 16 show symptoms of mental health problems. Some 15 per cent of them meet the criteria to be diagnosed with a disorder. The study is part-funded by the Voluntary Organisation Project Scheme (VOPS). The figures are at par with those of other countries, however, Malta’s mental health structure remains severely limited. Therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists are leaving the state service and are not being replaced, and most of those who remain feel helpless and overworked. “We need to employ more doctors and professionals from abroad, like we’re doing with all other services and industries,” Camilleri said. Three-quarters of all mental disorders begin before the age of 25, so it is crucial to address them at the earliest possible stage. He warned that if Malta did not take mental health issues in children seriously it risked suffering the consequences in 50 years’ time. Sacco added this meant that in future, Malta risked a higher number of unhappier adults with lower self-esteem, who would have dropped out of school earlier, found it harder to retain jobs and engaged in criminal behaviour.   The cost of dealing with the consequences would be “far greater and more devastating” than if we had addressed mental health problems in childhood now. Sacco and Camilleri acknowledged that the government had drawn up a mental health strategy and had promised to move children's services to the community. However, neither the plan nor the move were implemented, as “there is no plan”. “We are stuck, we are not moving forward. And we are not even using the resources we have creatively enough to be more productive,” Camilleri added. “The mental health of children is a public health priority, and we need to start off by raising awareness on good mental health,” Camilleri said.

From exotic animals to art: €51.5m assets seized from crime suspects last year,Matthew Xuereb,"The Asset Recovery Bureau, the agency responsible for confiscating criminals’ assets, seized more than €51.5 million worth of property and other valuable goods last year, a €20 million increase over the previous year. This amount includes some €10.2 million seized in collaboration with the police in six cases they were investigating. The seized assets include nearly €47 million worth of immovable property, nearly €2 million worth of tools, industrial equipment and material, €1.7 million worth of vehicles, €620,000 worth of furniture and domestic goods, €430,000 in nautical vessels, €142,000 worth of works of art, antiques, books and melitensia, and €72,000 worth of stocks which include spirits. Moreover, €51,000 worth of exotic animals, €20,000 in jewellery, €6,700 worth of weapons and just over €1,000 in clothing were also seized. These assets were seized from 88 locations in Malta and Gozo, according to the bureau’s annual report. The bureau assisted the police in six cases in 26 of the locations, which together saw the seizure of almost €8.9 million worth of immovable property, €932,000 worth of vehicles, €230,000 in domestic goods, almost €51,000 worth of exotic animals, €2,000 in works of art and €16,000 worth of jewellery.  The bureau reported an “exponential increase” in the number of cases it was involved in, as well as in the complexity of assets held by people in the criminal world. This forced the bureau to increase its human resources to broaden its expertise in exotic animals, weapons, accounting and stock management, industrial equipment, books and melitensia.  During 2022, the bureau saw an “upward trend” in all types of court orders it processed, including freezing orders, variations orders and cancellation orders. Commenting on crimes that lead to the seizure of assets, the bureau said that drug-related offences continued to be the most prevalent, followed by money laundering cases. Throughout 2022, the bureau was heavily involved in the provision of international assistance and cooperation to law enforcement and asset recovery offices fighting crime across multiple jurisdictions. The number of requests received by the Maltese office steadily increased from 13 in 2019 to 64 in 2022. In terms of frozen assets by the ARB in 2022, immovables represented the largest portion, with a value of almost €16 million, followed by bank accounts holding a total of €1.3 million and vehicles worth a total of €960,000. Another €624,000 worth of unregistered assets, nautical vessels and investments were also frozen in the year under review. The ARB’s Asset Management Unit requires ample space to store and maintain seized assets so the bureau reached joint collaborative agreements with several other governmental entities and various museums to protect, store and maintain seized and confiscated cultural assets and specific works of art. Such assets are transferred for temporary safekeeping and storage to various museums, while they are displayed for public viewing and cultural appreciation. To address the problem of space, the bureau is building a new compound in Ħal Far to securely store assets recovered from crime. Built on a footprint of 1,320 square metres, the building will preserve assets recovered from criminal activities, including jewellery, works of art, boats, trailers and cars. The building will have five floors and an underground basement. The first floor will be dedicated to offices while a goods lift will be capable of lifting passenger cars and small trucks from the basement to the fourth floor.

Sliema double murder: victims’ brothers devastated as trial is put off,Mark Laurence Zammit,"The families of two murdered men are “devastated” and “extremely disappointed” at how the alleged murderer has “managed to dodge” his trial meant to begin on Monday. Pippo Pandolfino and Tom Maciejowski – the brothers of murdered men Christian Pandolfino and Ivor Maciejowski – spoke to Times of Malta shortly after Daniel Muka’s trial was postponed to April. He has objected to being represented by a State-funded lawyer. “We have to emotionally prepare ourselves each time we go to court and each delay adds so much more unnecessary heartache,” Maciejowski said. “We all desperately need closure.”   Pandolfino said that, three years ago, when his brother was murdered, he had to break the horrible news to his mother and father and he had to do it again yesterday. “When my brother was murdered, my parents were 84 and it was the hardest thing I had to do in my life,” he said. “Today, they’re 87 and I had to go back to them and tell them they won’t see justice for now. I’m worried that, like Daphne Caruana Galizia’s mother, they too will not have enough time to see justice done. They have every right to achieve closure on their son’s brutal murder.”   The couple were fatally shot in what investigators believe may have been a botched robbery in 2020 involving three men. Albanian Daniel Muka, 28, allegedly pulled the trigger. Muka was already a suspect in an audacious 2017 jewellery heist in which he allegedly tried to shoot two policemen during his arrest. Maciejowski – who purposely flew in with his family from the UK for the trial – said that, while his family was extremely grateful for the hard work of law enforcement on the case, they were baffled as to how the Maltese legal system allowed Muka to “dodge justice” once again.  Ivor (right) with his parents. Photo: Family photo   The trial had been scheduled to start last May. Back then, he had also changed his lawyer, forcing the court to postpone the trial to yesterday, to give his new, legal aid lawyer enough chance to work the case. Pandolfino also praised the work of law enforcement and said he understood the judge had his hands tied. However, he fears the accused is using delaying tactics to be released on bail again.   “No wonder court cases in Malta take forever to be decided,” Pandolfino said. “The longer this case drags out, the less likely it is that the killer will be brought to justice. Look what happened with the case of Albert Rosso – the two men were acquitted and justice failed him. Doesn’t this country learn anything from past mistakes?” What if, in April, Muka again says he does not trust his new lawyer, Pandolfino asked. “Will this go on forever? If any other criminal out there follows his lead, all the court cases that already take ages will be further delayed. All they have to do is say they don’t have faith in their lawyer at the last minute.” You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

German court jails ex-skinhead over deadly 1991 arson,AFP,"A German court Monday sentenced a former skinhead to nearly seven years in jail over a 1991 arson attack on a shelter for asylum seekers that killed a Ghanaian man. The attack in Saarlouis remained unsolved for decades as one of Germany's most prominent extremist cold cases before the probe was relaunched in 2020 after new evidence emerged.  The superior regional court in the western city of Koblenz ordered a jail term of six years and 10 months for the 52-year-old defendant identified only as Peter S. in line with German privacy rules.  Twenty years old and thus a minor at the time of the crime, he received a juvenile sentence for the charges which also included attempted murder and aggravated arson. Presiding judge Konrad Leitges said the defendant, who listened to the verdict with a slightly bowed head, acted ""based on his right-wing extremist beliefs, due to hatred of foreigners"".   The court found that in the early hours of September 19, 1991, Peter S. poured petrol at the entrance to the refugees' accommodation before setting it alight.  The fire spread rapidly up the stairwell, engulfing 27-year-old Ghanaian Samuel Yeboah, who died the same day, after suffering serious burns and smoke inhalation. ""His death was excruciating and took a long, long time,"" Leitges said. Two residents saved themselves by jumping out of the window, suffering broken bones. The remaining 18 reached safety uninjured. Leitges said Peter S. came from a troubled home and ""sought a replacement family"" in the skinhead scene around Saarlouis from the early 1990s and ""completely uncritically"" took on its ideology.  Peter S. was arrested in April 2022 and had since been held in pre-trial detention. He had bragged about the attack to a witness at a barbecue in 2007 saying, ""I did it and they never caught me.""  When the witness learned in 2019 that a person had been killed in the fire, she came forward. The judge thanked her for her ""courageous"" testimony. Prosecutors had demanded nine and a half years in prison while the defence team called for four and a half years. When the trial opened in November 2022, left-wing groups held a rally against the infamous attack being forgotten.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Minister asks Chamber of Advocates to investigate revolving door claims,Times of Malta,"Updated 5pm, adds government statement The Justice Minister has formally written to the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators asking them to investigate reports that the justice minister had not acted on recommendations by an inquiry he appointed three years ago to prevent ""revolving door situations"". Following the reports, a statement was issued by the Nationalist Party saying that the fact that a prosecuting lawyer at the Attorney General's Office was now working in the defence team of the Degiorgio brothers showed that the justice minister had not acted on the inquiry recommendations. Shadow Minister Karol Aquilina recalled that in June 2020 a board of inquiry appointed by Minister Jonathan Attard and headed by retired chief justice Joseph Azzopardi recommended that lawyers leaving the AG's office should not represent persons or companies which the AG's office would have started proceedings against. The inquiry was opened after lawyer Charles Merceica moved from the Attorney General's office to the defence team of Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of masterminding the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. But last week another former AG lawyer, George Camilleri, filed a judicial protest on behalf of the Degiorgio brothers against the prisons CEO. The brothers are serving time after admitting their role in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and have other pending cases.  The Nationalist Party asked what action Justice Minister Jonathan Attard had taken since he received the inquiry report. What action had been taken by Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to avoid cases such as this?   What changes had been made in the code of ethics of lawyers after the inquiry? Who would shoulder political responsibility in the latest case?    Aquilina said the justice minister and the attorney general should no longer abdicate their responsibilities because the message they were getting across through their actions was that people who had the money could freely buy the services of lawyers who until recently would have been leading proceedings against them.  In a statement, the Justice Ministry denied that no action had been taken following the inquiry. He said that any breach of ethics could be investigated by the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators either ex officio or when a breach was pointed out by someone. So earlier on Monday, he formally wrote to the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators asking them to investigate the reports. The ministry said that the inquiry had led to the introduction of a number of measures, both contractual but also ethical, to provide for a revolving door situation. A clause had been introduced for Attorney General employees not to appear for private clients or enter negotiations to become defence lawyers of private clients, personally or through third parties, while they are still AG employees Prosecutors within the AG's office should not, before the termination of their employment, make arrangements or preparations to act on behalf of people against whom prosecutions would be led by the AG or about whom the AG would have given advice or presented judicial acts, the ministry said.

Five youths being questioned about motorcycle thefts,Times of Malta,"Five youths were rounded up by the police and taken to a police station for questioning in connection with motorcycle thefts in various localities on Friday evening. The police were tipped off about a group of young people who were setting fire to objects in a field in Żabbar. Acting on information received, the police rounded up the youths in a field in Misraħ San Nikola in Ħaż-Żabbar. The group consisted of two 18-year-olds, one from Birżebbuġa and the other from Valletta, a 16 and 14-year-old from Żabbar and a fourteen-year-old from Cospicua. While on site, the police discovered motorcycles that had been reported stolen in the previous days and soon the police realised the youths matched the descriptions of those who had stolen the bikes. Further searches on another site led to more motorbikes that had also been reported as stolen. The youths were taken to a police station for questioning. Police investigations are underway.

Six suspects in assassination of Ecuador presidential candidate killed,AFP,"Six suspects in the August assassination of Ecuador presidential candidate and anti-corruption crusader Fernando Villavicencio were killed in prison on Friday, officials said. The SNAI prisons authority initially announced that ""an event occurred"" in the Guayas 1 prison in Guayaquil ""resulting in six dead people."" It later clarified the deceased were ""of Colombian nationality and accused of the murder of former presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio."" Villavicencio, a 59-year-old journalist, was gunned down as he left a campaign rally in the capital Quito days ahead of the first round vote. After news broke of the prison deaths, Ecuadoran President Guillermo Lasso announced he would immediately return from an international trip to handle the incident. Lasso had traveled to New York on Thursday for personal matters, and was due in Seoul on Saturday for official trade talks. ""In the next few hours I will return to Ecuador to attend to this emergency. Neither complicity nor cover-up, here the truth will be known,"" Lasso said on X, formerly Twitter. The public prosecutor's office said that its agents, along with police and the military, were ""executing security protocols... in light of the disturbance that occurred Friday afternoon."" It added in a statement on X that ""in the coming hours, specialized military personnel will carry out the first raids and reconnaissance of Cellblock 7, where the incidents originated, to take control of the situation.""   Guayas 1 is one of five facilities that make up a large prison complex in Guayaquil, a key port city that has become one of the country's increasingly bloody centers of a turf war between rival drug-trafficking gangs.  In late July, a riot in the Guayas 1 prison left more than 30 people dead. The assassination of Villavicencio, who had been polling in second place, rocked Ecuador days ahead of national elections in which corruption and the country's declining security situation were major themes. Six Colombians with long criminal records were arrested shortly after, while a seventh was killed at the scene of the crime. Villavicencio had carried out scores of investigations, including exposing a vast graft network which led to former president Rafael Correa being sentenced to eight years in prison. Correa fled the country to avoid jail time and has been exiled in Belgium for six years. Villavicencio had drawn the ire of gangs and drug traffickers with his reputation for speaking out against the cartels, many of which operate out of prisons across Ecuador. More than 430 inmates have died violently since 2021, dozens of them dismembered and incinerated amid disputes between rival gangs. In late August, dozens of guards were taken hostage at several prisons around the country before eventually being released. On Ecuador's streets, homicides have quadrupled between 2018 and 2022, climbing to a record 26 per 100,000 inhabitants. That rate could climb as high as 40 this year, according to experts. Ecuador was once a peaceful haven nestled between the world's largest cocaine producers -- Colombia and Peru. However, the war on drugs in other South American nations displaced drug cartels to Ecuador, which has large Pacific ports with laxer controls, widespread corruption, and a dollarized economy. The prisons crisis has become a key point of debate ahead of the second round election on October 15, between leftist lawyer Luisa Gonzalez and 35-year-old upstart Daniel Noboa. Noboa has proposed leasing ships to hold the country's most violent prisoners offshore.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Jonathan Ferris awarded €20,000 over unjustified dismissal",Edwina Brincat,"Jonathan Ferris’ claims that he was discriminated against and unjustly dismissed from his managerial post at the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) were vindicated by a tribunal that awarded him €20,000 in compensation. The former police inspector, whose name is synonymous with several major financial crime investigations, had taken up the position of Head of Unit at the FIAU on November 1, 2016.  But his new employment was short-lived.   RELATED STORIES  On June 16, 2017, he was fired during the probation period following a unanimous decision by the Board of Governors on the recommendation of the FIAU director. In a statement issued after that dismissal, the FIAU claimed the decision was “based solely on an objective and comprehensive performance assessment.” But Ferris claimed otherwise, insisting that that decision was politically motivated and that such discriminatory treatment in his regard was not acceptable in a democratic society.  He filed proceedings against the FIAU before the Industrial Tribunal. The FIAU claimed that Ferris’s arguments were frivolous and not proven. Moreover, since his termination had taken place during probation, that decision could not be reviewed in terms of law.  According to former chair of the FIAU board Peter Grech, the industrial dispute registered by Ferris was nothing but an attempt “to force an investigation into what had led to the termination”. The tribunal had to determine whether an employee could suffer discrimination during probation and whether this was so in Ferris’s case.  When delivering its decision on Friday, chair Anna Mallia observed that during probation an employer cannot do as he pleases simply because the employee is still on trial.  Rather, he must make sure that the newcomer is performing his duties well. He should offer the employee all support and assistance necessary to help him integrate into the new work environment rather than subject him to discrimination or victimisation by way of a strategy leading to his dismissal.  Did Ferris suffer discrimination during probation? Ferris claimed that there were “political reasons” behind his dismissal and hence, he suffered discrimination.  On the basis of the evidence put forward, the tribunal upheld that claim, observing that Ferris’ colleagues at the FIAU had not faced the same fate.  Trouble appeared to brew when FIAU reports about suspected financial wrongdoing at the now-shuttered Pilatus Bank were leaked to the media.  That was when Ferris was no longer trusted, unlike fellow officials, including three new analysts, who shared the same common password as Ferris.  In fact, the whole team shared that password, although the system could detect any login and any changes effected thereto.  Yet, all suspicions fell upon Ferris as the one who had leaked those reports.  On May 2, 2017, two days after seeing the Pilatus report drawn up by the compliance analyst, Ferris was instructed to steer clear of any investigations concerning the bank.  His superiors claimed that he had a conflict of interest since he had investigated and arrested former Pilatus employee, Maria Efimova, for alleged fraud against the bank. However, he was still to retain his position as Head of Unit, Ferris was told.  But after that date, he was sidelined in all FIAU discussions concerning politically exposed persons.  Other members of the team were not.  The tribunal failed to understand how the FIAU claimed not to be satisfied with Ferris’ performance, yet at the same time kept him on as Head of Unit, even when the leaks began.  He was also deemed sufficiently trustworthy to represent the regulator both locally and abroad, sometimes accompanied by those same people who later certified that he did not perform well.  Nor was it proven that he had leaked those reports because he was not the only person at FIAU who had access to them.  It was not proven that “sensitive” records had not been taken away by others who preceded Ferris at FIAU.  The first report about Pilatus bank was not prepared by Ferris and the one concerning Adrian Hillman was done before his time.  Another report on suspected kickbacks between Hillman and former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri was only handed to Ferris to sign when he first joined the FIAU.  Two reports about Schembri completed in June 2016 and November 2016 were passed on to the police, but Ferris only signed the second one.  He also did not draw up the report on former minister Konrad Mizzi and the board never convened to decide whether to forward it to the police.  As for another report about the LNG tanker, it was only signed by Ferris and not finalised by the FIAU board.  After considering each of those reports, the tribunal concluded that there was no proof that they had been leaked by Ferris. When all was considered his dismissal was deemed discriminatory and unjustified, said the tribunal and based on Ferris’s gross salary, annual increments and performance bonuses, awarded him €20,000 compensation.  Lawyers Andrew Borg Cardona, Jason Azzopardi and Eve Borg Costanzi assisted Ferris.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

US man jailed for groping sleeping plane passenger,AFP,"A US man who groped a sleeping passenger on a plane was jailed Thursday for nearly two years. Mohammad Jawad Ansari, 50, put his hand on the inner thigh of a woman as she slept in the middle seat of a flight from Cleveland to Los Angeles in February 2020. The victim, who was wearing a dress, woke up and pushed Ansari's hand away before leaving her seat and telling cabin crew about the assault, officials said. Ansari, who had denied the charge of abusive sexual contact, was found guilty after a four-day trial in May, the Department of Justice said. Ansari's ""groping left (his victim) shocked and afraid, and witnesses testified that she sobbed for the remainder of the flight,"" a prosecutor told a court in Los Angeles. On flights, the victim ""now struggles to fall asleep because she is constantly concerned about ‘what if someone touches me.’"" US District Judge Fernando Aenlle-Rocha jailed Ansari for 21 months and ordered him to pay over $40,000.

Inspector describes police investigations after sex scene video went viral,Edwina Brincat,"A man who was filmed having sex with a woman at the Luqa boċċi club last month told police that he did not know her name but she had been touching and teasing him during a group event and he “had gone along with her so that others could have fun.” He also said he did not know that their oral sex scene would end up going viral on Facebook, only realizing what had happened when people he knew began to ask, “what have you done, there?” A description of how events unfolded in the club was given to the court by Police Inspector Kurt Farrugia during proceedings against Mark Cachia Zammit, a 35-year-old deliveryman from Birzebbuga, who stands accused of filming the scene and sharing the footage without the consent of the couple. Cachia Zammit is pleading not guilty and his lawyers are arguing that he lacked criminal intent since he never meant to harm the alleged victims who had “tacitly consented” to the filming. Cachia Zammit was granted bail upon arraignment late last month. During that hearing, the court had issued a ban on publication of the victims' names. On Thursday, prosecuting inspector Farrugia testified how police investigations were kickstarted by an anonymous report on the police Facebook page, complete with the footage that was making the social media rounds. That footage showed a group of youths seated around a rectangular table inside an establishment - later identified as the Luqa boċċi club - while a couple in the background were engaging in oral sex, amid much shouting and laughter. Voices, captured in the video shouted out vulgar comments, goading on the man, teasing and mocking him as he went on, face in full view of the camera. “Blessings! …Buon appetit! Keep going!” shouted the viewers, keeping up the vulgar commentary, while the barman and his staff continued to serve the customers. Police soon identified the main player at that September 13 event. Two days later, the Zurrieq man was summoned to the Zabbar police station to give his version. He explained how he had been invited for a meal at the Luqa club by his friend, “Mark il-Ginġer” - the accused - and got a lift with four youths from Birzebbugia. There was quite a crowd when they arrived at the club including a woman whose name he did not know. The group entered the club together and sat down for their meal. When confronted by the footage, the man admitted that he had done it on his volition. He did not know the name of that woman but throughout the evening she had been “touching and teasing him” and he had gone along with her, “for the others to have fun.” The rest of the party had forked out some €10 each and had even paid for his meal, the man told police. His only concern about it all was his family. He told the police  had no idea about the footage being shared on social media and only realized when people began to question, “what have you done there?” Asked whether he knew who had filmed that video, the alleged victim said that it “must have been someone in there.” But when asked to identify any of the voices heard in the footage, he named his friend “Mark” who was the one who had invited him to the meal. “Mark” (the accused) was taken in for questioning and his mobile phone was seized. In the presence of his lawyer, he told police that he did not know everyone at the event since some people were invited by third parties. He said, however, that he had, the previous day, invited his friend, the alleged victim because “he fancied her [the woman in the video]”. He saw the two kissing that evening. His friend [the victim] did what he did when the woman undressed and “together they had fun.” Cachia Zammit denied that he was the one making the vulgar comments in the background. “I was only eating and watching,” he told police. Although he first insisted that he had received the video “from I don’t know who” he later admitted that he had filmed the activity, his hand holding up his mobile, in full view of the couple. He had shared that footage with two others. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, the inspector confirmed that the accused had told one of those two contacts, “please keep to yourself.” Asked whether the woman had been paid for her ‘services’ and who was the brains behind the entire incident, the accused had opted for silence, explained the inspector. Cachia Zammit also told the police that no one had given him permission to film but no one had stopped him either. Police found the woman’s number on the accused’s contacts list. She was listed as being the friend of the man in the video.  The alleged victim was also summoned to testify. However his testimony was postponed after prosecuting Inspector Paul Camilleri informed the court that investigations were still ongoing and that charges were to be pressed against him. Magistrate Nadine Lia, directed the witness to seek legal advice since he was to be prosecuted. The case continues. Inspectors Paul Camilleri and Kurt Farrugia are prosecuting. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta are defence counsel. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Second suspect arrested over disappearance of young men in Mexico,AFP,"A second suspect in a kidnapping, torture and murder investigation in Mexico has been arrested, prosecutors said Wednesday, after grisly images of them leaked, prompting public fury. In August, a week after the group of five childhood friends aged 19 to 22 vanished in the western state of Jalisco, police found charred bones and four skulls at a property in the area. Photos and videos emerged showing the men kneeling with their hands bound, and the moment one of them was attacked with a blunt object and a knife.   One clip appeared to show one friend attacking another, presumably forced to do so by their captors. A man identified as Celestino M. had been taken into custody in connection with the disappearance, the local prosecutor’s office said Wednesday. On Monday, authorities announced they had arrested another man, identified as Rogelio M., on charges related to the disappearances in the city of Lagos de Moreno. The five men were kidnapped on August 11 while they chatted in the working-class neighborhood of San Miguel. Jalisco Governor Enrique Alfaro previously said their disappearance was ""evidently linked to organized crime."" ""We are facing irrational, violent and direct attacks on the stability of Jalisco that demand a reaction from the Mexican state,"" he added. One of the most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, operates in the region and is embroiled in turf wars with rival drug syndicates. The case has stunned residents of Lagos de Moreno, home to a thriving dairy industry, colonial buildings and flower-filled parks honored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has registered more than 400 missing persons since 2009. Many are believed to have ended up in clandestine graves and crematoria, or their remains dissolved in acid. News of the arrest comes a week after six teenagers kidnapped in the neighboring state of Zacatecas were confirmed dead. The 14-to-18-year-olds had been abducted by an armed group after a party less than a week earlier. Mexico has recorded more than 420,000 murders since the launch of a controversial military anti-drug offensive in 2006. Since then, the country's murder rate has tripled to 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. It has registered more than 110,000 disappearances since 1962, most attributed to criminal organizations. About 15,000 of those have happened in Jalisco, the highest number among Mexico's 32 states. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Editorial: It should be the end of the road,Times of Malta,"Institutionalised corruption, nepotism and clientelism in Malta did not start in 2013. It is a systematic problem that has been festering for decades, with claims and reports of favours-for-votes increasing with every general election in living memory. Many corrupt practices in the past went under the radar. What has changed is the increasing scrutiny brought about by a more vigilant media and technological advancements that have made it harder for such practices to remain hidden. Thankfully, there is also the odd whistleblower. The investigation into the driving test racket we are releasing today will anger many. Others will remain immune, excusing corruption as part of our DNA, or say that “the others did it too”. Some will accuse us of partisan motives or making it up, despite being faced with hard evidence. We’ve been there before. But this freshest revelation, coming hot on the heels of the benefits fraud scandal, should jolt us once and for all to speak with one voice and to stop accepting the normalisation of what is intrinsically wrong.   Times of Malta has compiled evidence to show that ministers, canvassers, and ‘customer care’ officials working at ministries and the office of the prime minister were involved in a coordinated scheme designed to help, mainly, Labour Party voters obtain a driver’s licence for themselves or family members/friends.   Three men are facing court proceedings, but many other players remain hidden from the public gaze and ostensibly, police scrutiny. The alleged actions are a serious betrayal of public trust and this is why there is an overarching interest to make the details public. At the centre of this scandal is a disturbing nexus of political influence and public services. The people at the centre are public servants, entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the law and serving the people. Instead, they are using their position to help their party win votes at the expense of the public good. This scandal once again undermines public confidence in the government, even if that same confidence is being eroded with every disgraceful scandal. This story also exposes the unfair advantage many of us face when compared to those who are connected to power. If people can get ahead by bending the rules, it creates a disincentive to play by the book. If public servants are forced to give preferential treatment or risk their jobs, it undermines their morale and independence. What’s the point of creating entities, quangos and mountains of bureaucratic processes when you can shortcut all that with just a text to ‘your’ minister, or by calling the government’s ‘customer care’ section? They have turned public governance into a village club. It also undermines the integrity of the driving test system. If undeserving candidates can pass the test, it puts everyone at risk on the road. While the chats suggest that the most disastrous candidates were not allowed to pass, there are multiple examples of candidates being promised ‘assistance’ in their theory test or a practical exam without their instructor present. The culture of cronyism, where voters are rewarded for their loyalty to the ruling party, rather than merit, is one of the biggest diseases of this country. To see how deeply ingrained this system is, look no further than Ian Borg and Robert Abela’s responses to the revelations. Borg says he sees nothing wrong with what he did. Abela, like his predecessor, believes he should only act if and when police file criminal charges. This case exemplifies the rot that can set in when those in power prioritise political expediency over the rule of law and fair governance. The biggest disservice that all of us can do to our country when faced with such disgraceful actions, is to continue turning a blind eye.

Teen in court after schoolgirl becomes latest UK knife victim,AFP,"A teenager will appear in a London court on Friday charged with the murder of a 15-year-old schoolgirl in a case that has once again shone the spotlight on UK knife crime.  Elianne Andam was stabbed to death in Croydon, south London, as she went to school on Wednesday. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested shortly afterwards. He is due to appear at youth court, sitting at Croydon Magistrates' Court, later Friday charged with murder and possession of a knife, police said in a statement. Emergency services including an air ambulance were called to the scene at around 8.30am (0730 GMT) following reports of a stabbing. Paramedics battled to save the girl but she was pronounced dead at the scene 50 minutes later. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""heartbroken"" by the fatal incident and pledged to ""continue working day and night to end the scourge of knife crime in our city"".   According to official figures, 99 people under the age of 25 were killed in England and Wales with a knife or sharp object in the year to March 2023. Of those 13 were under the age of 16. The deaths were among 50,000 stabbing incidents in the year to March 2023, a 5% increase on the previous year and a 75% increase on a decade ago, the figures from the Office for National Statistics showed.  Andam was a pupil at Old Palace of John Whitgift School, a private girls' school in Croydon. ""We are deeply shocked by the senseless and tragic death of our much-loved and valued friend and pupil,"" the school said in a statement.

Rotterdam hospital was warned about shooter: reports,AFP,"Dutch authorities had rung alarm bells about the ""psychotic behaviour"" of a man suspected of a shooting and arson rampage through Rotterdam that claimed three lives, according to local media Friday. The Public Prosecution Service had written earlier in the year to the Erasmus university hospital about the medical student suspected of shooting dead his neighbour, her 14-year-old daughter, and a teacher at the hospital. The man, named locally as Fouad L., displayed ""worrying"" and ""psychotic"" behaviour, including lying half-naked on a pile of leaves in his garden and laughing maniacally, prosecutors told the university in an email confirmed to be authentic by public broadcaster NOS.   Authorities had also examined the 32-year-old's phone and found images of people being stabbed, along with far-right propaganda, according to the email. ""I assume this will influence your decision as to whether he is eligible for the basic medical diploma,"" prosecutors wrote in the email. The suspect, now in custody, first stormed into his neighbour's house, shooting dead a 39-year-old woman and severely wounding her 14-year-old daughter, who later died of her injuries. He set fire to this house and then moved to the hospital, bursting into a classroom and shooting dead a 43-year-old teacher. Police had initially said the teacher was 46 before correcting the age. Dressed in combat gear and wearing a bulletproof vest, the gunman went to the main wing of the hospital and set the building ablaze, sparking panic as medical staff tried to evacuate patients, some in wheelchairs and stretchers. Police said the suspect was cooperating with their enquiry and have not yet given a motive. The suspect had been convicted for animal cruelty after abusing his pet rabbit and prosecutors said in their letter that his acts had been filmed by a neighbour. It was not yet clear whether the neighbour was the person he shot. He is thought to have held a deep grudge against the hospital, although it is not known whether the facility had acted on the warning from prosecutors. Police said that he had acted alone and that the killings were ""targeted"", not random. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Shock in Spain as 14-year-old stabs five people in school,AFP,"A 14-year-old stabbed three teachers and two students at a school in southern Spain Thursday, sparking soul-searching in a country where such attacks are very rare.  The teenager, who has not been identified, stabbed his victims repeatedly shortly after classes began at a school in Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, police spokesman Adrian Dominguez told reporters at the scene. ""Police located the suspect on the third floor. He had in his possession the two knives used to attack three teachers and two students,"" he said.   Four of the five injured sustained light wounds, while the fifth, a teacher, would need surgery for an injury to the eyelid, regional government education minister Patricia del Pozo told reporters. Several students told Spanish media the pupil stabbed two classmates before attacking the teacher, injuring her eye.  He then ran into another classroom and continued his attack. One student, who was not identified, told private television La Sexta that the teenager ""ran to the back of the class, dropped his backpack on the floor and pulled out two knives. ""Then he started shouting 'I'm going to kill you!'"" ""He was running, chasing people, everyone went out into the playground,"" the student said.  Another unnamed student told Canal Sur television the suspect had ""a look on his face like he wanted to stab everyone"". When the news broke, parents rushed to the school, which has 687 pupils, and gathered outside the gates which were cordoned off by police.  Local mayor Maria Jose Garcia-Pelayo described the incident as ""devastating"", telling reporters the suspect had ultimately been disarmed by the teachers.  ""All the parents were outside the school and all they wanted to do was be able to hug their children,"" she said.  Andalusia's regional leader Juan Manuel Moreno said it was unclear what triggered the attack, but warned about the danger of youngsters being exposed to extreme violence. ""We all need to think hard about the role of violence on TV, in films and video games, and on social media.. (which is) gratuitous and sometimes extreme,"" he said.  Top church official Archbishop Francisco Cesar Garcia Magan said the stabbing should provoke ""an urgent reflection"" within Spanish society which was facing ""a very serious situation and a problematic outlook for the future"".  He also called for efforts to improve education about mental health issues.  Compared with other European countries, Spain has a relatively low crime rate, especially violent crime.  Excluding 2020, when incidents were especially rare because of the Covid lockdowns, the rate in 2021 of 41.4 incidents per 1,000 people was the lowest in recent history, government figures show.

Three killed in twin Dutch shootings,AFP,"A gunman dressed in combat gear and wearing a bulletproof vest went on a shooting rampage at a house and a hospital in Rotterdam Thursday, killing a 14-year-old girl, her mother and a teacher. Dutch police said they were still investigating the motive for the twin attacks by the 32-year-old man, who also set fire to the hospital and the house. The man first burst into a house in the Dutch port city and opened fire, killing a 39-year-old woman and seriously injuring her 14-year-old daughter, police chief Fred Westerbeke told reporters. The girl later died of her injuries. He then moved to a classroom at the Erasmus MC university hospital, shooting dead a 46-year-old teacher before starting another fire in the facility, sparking panic. Elite police stormed the hospital, as panicked medical staff in white coats flooded out of the building pushing patients in wheelchairs and on stretchers. He was taken into custody shortly afterwards and chief public prosecutor Hugo Hillenaar told reporters the suspect was cooperating with police following his arrest. ""We cannot say anything about the motive of this terrible act at this time. The probe is still ongoing,"" said Hillenaar. The suspect was thought to have possessed only one firearm and there is no indication he had accomplices, authorities said. Police said the suspect, a student at the hospital, was already known to the authorities over a conviction for animal cruelty.  An investigation is underway as to whether he was a student of the teacher shot dead. Authorities believe that the woman and her daughter were close neighbours of the suspect, leading Westerbeke to suggest they were ""targeted attacks"". He had earlier been described as tall, with black hair, wearing ""combat-style"" clothes and carrying a backpack. ""I am angry and sad,"" said Rotterdam mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb, who spoke of a ""black day"" for his city. ""We have been shocked by a horrific incident... the emotion in the city is running high,"" the mayor told reporters.  Witnesses described the chaotic scenes around the hospital, as helicopters buzzed overhead and police snipers took up positions on the hospital roof. ""First there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,"" said a medical student quoted by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name. ""There was a lot of panic and screaming... I didn't hear any shots, just the panic and that's what I started to act on,"" public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying. Prime Minister Mark Rutte spoke of his ""great dismay"" at the shootings. ""My thoughts go out to the victims of the violence, their loved ones and all those who have been hugely scared,"" he added in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.  King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima said their hearts went out to those suffering ""intense grief"". ""It's unbelievable,"" said Rotterdam GP Matthijs van der Poel, cited on the Algemeen Dagblad website. ""Everyone is totally shocked by the events and is watching the news with horror. I'm afraid such things cannot be prevented,"" he said. Rotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs. In 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt. And in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year-old Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.

"Man whose court case has dragged for 10 years wins €2,500 compensation",Matthew Xuereb,"The Attorney General has been ordered to pay a man facing criminal proceedings over drug smuggling €2,500 in compensation because the case has been dragging for 10 years. The AG and was given 30 days to decide whether to issue a bill of indictment against the accused or else pay €50 a day until a final decision is taken. Joseph Grech, 55, from Marsa had been arrested in 2013 in connection with the discovery of 28 sacks, containing about 430 kilograms of cannabis leaves and blocks of cannabis resin buried in a field in Victoria Gardens, St Julian’s in 2009. Six other people were also charged in connection with the drug find - the largest ever in Malta at the time. Mr Justice Robert Mangion heard how the prosecution had not finished exhibiting its evidence, due to the Attorney General’s insistence on hearing the evidence of two witnesses, Scott Dixon and Kevin Sammut, who the defence is arguing, cannot be heard because they qualify as co-accused. Dixon and Sammut had been called to the witness stand but had declined to testify in view of the ongoing criminal proceedings against them about the same drugs, with the case against Grech being paused indefinitely. Grech filed a constitutional case claiming a breach of his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time and asking the court to order the prosecution to declare its evidence closed. The Attorney General argued that the prosecution’s insistence on the testimony of these two witnesses, who are presently indicted, was not a capricious one, but arose out of its obligation to prove its case carefully. The court heard Assistant Police Commissioner Dennis Theuma explain how the case had reached a bottleneck because Dixon and Sammut would not testify. Asked who had decided to prosecute the men separately, Theuma said the decision was taken by the Attorney General, in consultation with the police. He conceded that the case against the other two men was “years” away from its conclusion, not least because they are yet to face a trial by jury. In his judgement, Mr Justice Mangion said the delay on the part of the prosecution to declare its evidence closed was due to its insistence to produce third party witnesses “who…are inadmissible at this stage.” It was clear that the prosecution was awaiting the conclusion of criminal proceedings against third parties to summon them as witnesses against Grech. The judge said it was true that without Dixon and Sammut’s testimony the prosecution’s case against Grech might not be strong enough to achieve a conviction. However, on the other hand, the proceedings against Grech could not be paused indefinitely in the hope that they could one day testify, probably years from now, assuming no further proceedings are filed against them. Mr Justice Mangion declared that the delays were breaching the defendant’s fundamental rights and therefore declared the compilation of the prosecution’s evidence closed. He also ordered the AG to decide whether to issue a bill of indictment in the next 30 days or be liable to compensate Grech by €50 for every day in excess of that period, until the relative orders are issued.

Christian Borg loses bid to stop BOV closing his accounts,Matthew Xuereb,"Car rental entrepreneur and alleged kidnapper Christian Borg was unsuccessful in a legal bid to stop Bank of Valletta from closing his bank accounts. Borg and his company, No Deposit Cars Limited, failed to persuade the court to stop the bank from implementing its decision which they claimed was based on bad press. Borg was arrested and charged in court in January last year in connection with a botched kidnapping in a case that is believed to have stemmed from the theft of cars.  RELATED STORIES  Borg hit the headlines again last March following revelations by Times of Malta that his car hire-purchase company, No Deposit Cars Malta, made customers sign contracts accepting that their vehicles may have GPS tracking devices installed. Scores of customers have filed judicial protests asking for their contracts with the company to be rescinded and calling for a police investigation into tax evasion and fraud.   Last April, Times of Malta ran an exposé of Borg’s vast unexplained wealth, reporting that investigators suspect he may be using his car business to launder funds from drug trafficking and other criminal activity. Borg and No Deposit Cars filed separate applications in court earlier this month requesting an injunction to stop Bank of Valletta from closing any of their accounts or stopping the provision of banking services. They said their BOV bank accounts were the only ones they had in Malta and that the bank did not provide any reason to back up its decision. Borg said the bank’s decision especially jarred when the same bank, in January, approved his request for “platinum credit” which meant that he had passed any due diligence the bank had conducted.  RELATED STORIES  Borg and his company claimed that it was “most likely” that the decision was taken due to “adverse media” publicity against him and the companies of which he is the ultimate beneficial owner. They claimed that this was discriminatory and unfair, especially when he always passed all due diligence tests. He told the court that he was going to suffer “serious prejudice” if the bank was allowed to close his bank accounts or continue with its refusal to provide any banking services. Borg further claimed that the decision will inevitably lead to the collapse of his two companies – No Deposit Cars Limited and Princess Holdings Limited – with inevitable repercussions on his family and hundreds of customers. After upholding the application provisionally, Madam Justice Josette Demicoli set a hearing during which the bank said that Borg’s allegations were simply based on “pretended rights”. It said that when the banking relationship with Borg began, he had accepted the terms and conditions. Bank of Valletta said that just like any client had the right to stop using its services without providing an explanation, the bank too had the right to terminate any relationship with its clients, giving them two months’ notice to allow the clients to find an alternative solution. Four months had passed and Borg keeps getting extensions. The bank refuted claims that it based its decision on bad press but neither could it ignore them, adding that it was bound by regulations imposed by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU). In her decision, Madam Justice Demicoli ruled that, without entering into the merits of the cases or allegations against Borg or any of his companies, Borg did not convince the court of the need to issue an injunction. A warrant of prohibitory injunction is a tool to stop someone from taking action which could have prejudicial effects against somebody else. The law requires two elements for the courts to accept such a request. Firstly, the applicant must show that prima facie (at face value) he has rights, and secondly must prove that, if the court does not accede to a request for the issue of a warrant of the prohibitory injunction, then the applicant’s rights would be “irremediably prejudiced”. In this case, Madam Justice Demicoli said Borg and his companies failed to satisfy these elements and, therefore, the court was turning down their request.

Former footballer jailed for three years in romance fraud case,Edwina Brincat,"Former Malta Premier League player Sunday Ikechukwu Eboh was found guilty of money laundering as part of a romance fraud case and sentenced to three years imprisonment on Monday. He was also fined €20,000. The former player was among a group of Nigerian men and a Maltese woman who were accused of having tricked an elderly woman by fostering an online relationship with a fictitious American soldier who told her he was moving to Malta following his deployment. She transferred €58,000 to him in a series of small bank transactions to local banks.  Eboh is a familiar name locally: the former footballer played for a series of Maltese clubs over the past 20 years, from Marsa to Birkirkara, Floriana, Marsaxlokk, Naxxar and Pembroke. He retired in 2020.  Two members of the plot had admitted to their involvement, and later testified against the co-accused. The court on Monday convicted other members of the plot. Tony Ogbonna Anuforo was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment and ordered to reimburse €15, 400 within six months. The court said it was ordering compensation of the victim rather than order forfeiture of an equivalent amount in favour of the State coffers. Both are to pay €2, 572.57 each in expert expenses.  All their properties are forfeited in favour of the government.  The court said it also ""strongly solicits"" the principal immigration officer to exercise his powers once the accused have served their punishment. Alexandra Pace was found guilty of making a false declaration and relapsing and cleared of all the other offences.  She was condemned to a €200 fine.  Pace was cleared of money laundering since it found no proof that she even suspected the funds she was about to receive were of tainted origin. When Tabi Ovi (who was previously found guilty in separate proceedings) testified, he noted that Pace initially did not know about such a scheme, so it was when the money came in that she checked since the bank requested a reason. Pace did not get any form of commission.  All three were placed under a 3-year restraining order in favour of the two victims. The case goes back to September 2020 when a woman reported at Paola police station how her mother who had been chatting with someone named Smith Jones on Facebook.  He told her mum that he was an American soldier deployed in Afghanistan. He asked for her mobile number and the two began to chat on WhatsApp.  He then told her that she would receive a package as well as €45K and a certificate worth €1m.  He then sent her details of several Maltese bank accounts and asked her for money.  The first request was followed by more. And so, the woman was drawn into the fraudulent scheme. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech observed that the lifestyle Sunday Eboh was leading, rents, payments for maintenance and holidaying abroad was ""not consonant with his lawful income. "" He came up with a story about a certain ""Tony Montana"" whom he met in a Bugibba African shop. Tony had allegedly asked Eboh for permission to use his account to receive €7000 from his girlfriend.  But the tale about Tony appeared to have been fabricated and the dubious character was kept ""constantly in the shadows... his identity undisclosed. "" Sunday Eboh was ""untruthful at best, unreliable, unsubstantiated in totality, with his Tony Montana remaining a phantom. "" The court ordered the police commissioner to continue further investigations in a bid to identify and bring to justice another man allegedly involved in the scam.   Ogbonna declared that he worked as security guard since 2018. But there was nothing on Jobsplus records. The magistrate ordered copy of the judgment to be notified to police, employment and tax authorities for ""immediate investigations and possible prosecution.""  Court also noted that both Eboh and Ogbonna showed ""no remorse"" and deserved to go to jail.  Punishment was also to serve as a deterrent ""to anyone who thinks they can identify and prey on innocent, trustful and unsuspecting members of society. "" The ""docile elderly"" victim was ""physically and psychologically"" broken by the ""elaborate"" scheme devised by these ""evil criminals, "" observed the court. Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Joe Mifsud represented Eboh and Ogbonna while Pace was represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Francesca Zarb.

"Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro dies in hospital, aged 61",AFP,"Updated 11.30am Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, captured in January after three decades on the run, died on Monday in hospital in central Italy. The 61-year-old had been treated for colon cancer while detained in a high-security jail in L'Aquila but was moved last month to hospital after his condition deteriorated. L'Aquila mayor Pierluigi Biondi confirmed the mobster's death in hospital ""following a worsening of his illness"". His death ""puts the end to a story of violence and blood"", Biondi told the ANSA news agency. He thanked prison and hospital staff for their ""professionalism and humanity"".   It was ""the epilogue of an existence lived without remorse or repentance, a painful chapter in the recent history of our nation"". Messina Denaro was one of the most ruthless bosses in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies. He was convicted of involvement in the murder of anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992 and in deadly bombings in Rome, Florence and Milan in 1993. One of his six life sentences was for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the 12-year-old son of a witness in the Falcone case. ""No-one should be denied prayers. But I cannot say I'm sorry,"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on social media of the mobster's death. Messina Denaro disappeared in the summer of 1993 and spent the next 30 years on the run as the Italian state cracked down on the Sicilian mob. But he remained the top name on Italy's most-wanted list and increasingly became a figure of legend. It was his decision to seek treatment for his cancer that led to his capture. He was arrested on January 16, 2023, when he visited a health clinic in Palermo. He was jailed in L'Aquila, where he continued treatment in his cell, but was moved to hospital in August, under heavy security.   Since Friday night, he had been reported to have been in an ""irreversible coma"". Medics had stopped feeding him and he had asked not to be resuscitated, Italian media reports said. His arrest may have brought some relief for his victims but the mob boss always maintained his silence. In interviews in custody after being arrested, Messina Denaro even denied he was a member of the Cosa Nostra. After Messina Denaro went on the run, there was intense speculation that he had gone abroad -- and he probably did. But in the end, he was found to have been staying near his hometown of Castelvetrano in western Sicily. Castelvetrano mayor Enzo Alfano said he hoped the ""suffocating cloud"" hanging over his town would now lift. ""It will take decades to eradicate the mentality, the sometimes rampant culture of lawlessness, of impunity"" that Messina Denaro ""cultivated for so long"", he said.   Preparations are already under way for the mobster's burial in the family tomb in the town, alongside his father, Don Ciccio, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Don Ciccio was also head of the local clan. He was said to have died of a heart attack while on the run, his body left in the countryside, dressed for the funeral. Investigators had been combing the Sicilian countryside for Messina Denaro for years, searching for hideouts and wiretapping members of his family and his friends. They were heard discussing the medical problems of an unnamed person who suffered from cancer, as well as eye problems -- a person who detectives became sure was Messina Denaro. They used a national health system database to search for male patients of the right age and medical history, and eventually closed in.

"Man accused of assaulting his partner, locking her up",Times of Malta,"A man who allegedly assaulted and then locked up his partner after a row over a deleted phone message was taken to court on Sunday and remanded in custody. A magistrate heard that the argument broke out at about 2am on Friday when the man, Tyler Camilleri, 24, wanted to know what was behind a Facebook message which was received by his partner and deleted by the sender. She had tried to explain that the sender was a friend on Facebook and the message was harmless. But matters escalated and the woman was allegedly beaten on her face and head, suffering slight injuries. She was then locked up for hours in the house in Zejtun she shared with her partner. The woman, whose name cannot be published by court order, managed to contact her mother and she was rescued by her mother’s partner, who climbed over a wall to get access to the locked house. She was then examined at Paola health centre. While she was there her partner showed up and tried to get to her by telling the security officer that he was her brother, but her mother told the officer that her daughter had no siblings. A police report was then filed. Camilleri was accused of injuring his partner, holding her against her will and causing her to fear violence. He was also accused of breaking the conditions of a probation order and being a recidivist. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecution objected to a request for bail in view of the accused's record, saying he could not be trusted, Prosecutors also pointed to the seriousness of the case and the fact that civilians still had to testify. The defence argued that the witnesses should have been presented immediately, pointing out that up to some time ago, such cases used to be summarily heard and concluded in one sitting. Now a person with a steady job who needed to support his family ended up having to undergo a lengthy process.  It was also pointed out that the accused had suffered a knife wound by the alleged victim. Magistrate Gianella Camilleri Busuttil refused bail but ordered the prosecution to produce its witnesses at the next sitting. Inspector Audrey Micallef prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Police still looking for fugitives Jomic Calleja Maatouk and his wife Marzia,Matthew Xuereb,"The police are still looking for Jomic Calleja Maatouk, who was convicted of importing explosives, almost a month since he was placed on Europol’s list of Europe’s most wanted fugitives, sources have confirmed. The Maltese police are collaborating with their European counterparts in an attempt to find Calleja Maatouk and his wife Marzia. Malta has already issued European Arrest Warrants for the couple, while Jomic Calleja Maatouk was also placed on Europol’s list of Europe’s most wanted fugitives. According to the latest intelligence, the couple is believed to have absconded from Malta, probably by sea, since no official sea and air departures list included their names. “We are in constant contact with our colleagues around Europe because although we believe they are in Serbia, they might have moved to nearby countries,” police sources told Times of Malta. Serbia has an extradition agreement with Malta.   The police believe the Calleja Maatouks either used false passports to get out of the country or crossed to Sicily by sea and then drove through Italy northwards. Jomic Calleja Maatouk, 36, was sentenced to five years in jail after he was convicted of importing explosives and trying to buy poison. He must also serve a prison sentence over drug offences. He was out on bail after he appealed his conviction but did not sign a bail book for a number of days. In court, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech had described him as a “lethal weapon” who was ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated”. Calleja Maatouk had been caught trying to import deadly material that included lethal doses of radioactive material Polonium-210, highly toxic poison Ricin, killer drug Fentanyl and C-4 explosives.   His wife, 23-year-old Marzia, was in July sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted of cannabis possession with intent. The crime took place in August 2019 when she was just 19. Soon after her disappearance, Marzia’s family told Times of Malta they were fearing for her safety after the couple’s home was found in a mess. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the family said Marzia has not been online on WhatsApp, and calls to her mobile phone were returning voicemail messages that appeared to indicate it has been switched off for days. Her brother was the first to sound the alarm when his sister did not show up at his shop to cover a shift and was not taking his calls. “We are extremely worried she might have been forced to leave the country and that she might be in danger right now,” one tearful relative had told Times of Malta. Jomic Calleja Maatouk has a long criminal record as well as a history of fleeing the law. In 2015 he was arrested aboard a train in Sicily heading to the Italian mainland, having left Malta as he faced criminal proceedings related to cannabis trafficking.

Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro in an 'irreversible coma' ,AFP,"Notorious Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, captured in January after three decades on the run, is in a coma in hospital and no longer being fed, media reports said Saturday.  The 61-year-old has been suffering from colon cancer for several years. It was his decision to seek treatment that led to his arrest following a visit to a clinic in the Sicilian capital Palermo. Facing numerous life sentences, he was detained in a high-security jail in L'Aquila, where he continued treatment in his cell, according to reports. But in early August, Messina Denaro was moved to the inmates ward of the local hospital, where his condition has declined in recent days. He is now in an ""irreversible coma"", according to media reports. Medics have stopped feeding him and he has asked not to be resuscitated. Messina Denaro was for many years a leading figure in Cosa Nostra, the real-life Sicilian crime syndicate depicted in the Godfather movies.

From the Bench: You've been cancelled!,| Nicole Vassallo,"A procedural notion which often goes unnoticed is the cancellation of a case following the parties’ failure to appear at trial. In any litigious cause, the two sides with a vested interest, i.e., plaintiff(s) who instituted the cause and defendant(s) against whom the cause was instituted, are expected to participate actively in the proceedings, which participation involves, at the very least, their presence during the trial. Article 199 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta) caters for those instances in which either both plaintiff and defendant, or the plaintiff, fail to make an appearance during a trial before the Superior or Inferior Courts. A judgment in which this procedural instrument was invoked due to the failure of appearance of both plaintiff and defendant was that in the names of Duncan Mizzi v. Keven Agbigbi, delivered on August 30, 2023 by the Rent Regulation Board. The parties’ non-appearance despite the case being called three times, led the board to order the cancellation of the cause from the list, at the plaintiff’s sole expense. When a cause is called three times and the defendant or his advocate appears but not the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s advocate, the defendant has the right to demand that the plaintiff be non-suited with costs, effectively discontinuing the proceedings. This is not to say that the plaintiff does not have a remedy in the event of cancellation of the cause following failure to appear. An application for restoration of the cause to the list needs to be filed within three months from the date of cancellation. Such a demand will only be met once, so the plaintiff and/or his legal counsel must ensure their presence at subsequent hearings of the trial. Having said that, the principle of cancellation of causes may not be invoked when a cause is awaiting the outcome of another cause. Despite the wording of Article 199 suggesting that the power to cancel a cause from the list is one which vests solely in the Superior and Inferior Courts, and not in boards, the board ascertained in its judgment of Mizzi v. Agbigbi, that the Reletting of Urban Property (Regulation) Ordinance grants the Rent Regulation Board the authority to exercise the powers vested in the Civil Court by Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta (of which the cancellation of causes due to default in appearance forms part via Article 199). In the judgment of Mizzi v. Agbigbi, after the cancellation of the cause from the list due to the parties’ failure to make an appearance, the plaintiff chose not to avail of his remedy granted by Article 199(3) of Chapter 12 to restore the cause to the list, for this to heard and determined upon the same acts. As a result, the Rent Regulation Board reaffirmed its decree whereby it had cancelled the cause at plaintiff’s expense, and lastly declared that it will not be taking further cognizance of the proceedings. This means that in view of plaintiff’s inaction to request the restoration of the cause within the three month window allowed by Article 199(3), plaintiff may not institute proceedings against the same defendant and on the same merits on which the cancelled cause was based. The judgment is still pending appeal before the Court of Appeal (Inferior Jurisdiction). Dr Nicole Vassallo is a junior associate at Azzopardi Borg and Associates Advocates.

Former commissioner wanted probe into Valletta police fraud 'put away',Edwina Brincat,"A police sergeant who is facing criminal action for allegedly claiming undue extra duty payments has been described by his former superiors as an “upright” man who kept his subordinates “in check” and was “one of the best on duty"". The officers were testifying on Wednesday in proceedings against PS Alexander Schembri, 56, and Joseph Debrincat, 64, formerly stationed at the Valletta police station. Investigations against them were triggered by an anonymous letter which landed on the desk of former CEO now Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa’ alleging that certain officers at Valletta were doing extra duties during normal work hours and were claiming payment for both. The matter was referred to then-Commissioner Lawrence Cutajar who requested a report. Subsequently, on the basis of the information received he held that there was no ground for further action and advised that the investigation was to be “put away,” Superintendent James Grech from the Economic Crimes Squad testified. But the Internal Audit and Investigations Department had proceeded with their investigation into the goings on at the Valletta district, checking all those officers who earned more than €10,000 in extra duties in one year. Some officers had received petty amounts of €20 or €30 spread over various months and those were deemed insignificant and having no criminal intent in those cases, explained Grech. But that was not the case in respect of others. Schembri, who was detail officer at the time - setting the schedules, assigning duties and confirming invoices including his own - stood out. There were times when he worked more than 24 hours in one day and some of the hours were not written down in the detail (work schedule) but were traced on the invoice books. Thus on April 17, 2019, he worked 32 hours and on July 30, 2019, he worked 27 hours in a day, said Grech. During a five-and-half-hour interrogation, Schembri did not have a proper explanation for those extra hours, saying that there may have been some “mistake.” Former Commissioner Cutajar testified that, from memory, he believed that it turned out that Schembri had been granted some time off in lieu. “Alex (Schembri) was one of the best I had on duty,” he continued, explaining that he would occasionally alert him to some upcoming event that would need more officers on duty. “But there was no need for me to tell him how to work out the detail,” added the former police chief. Under further questioning, he gave an overview of how extra duties were paid and how sometimes unpredictable circumstances could create a need for some duty officer to step in on extra duty. In that case, the payment would be classified as “revenue” and deposited in the state coffers rather than in the officer’s account. Former Assistant Commissioner Stephen Mallia, who at the time was in charge of Region A - Valletta, Qormi and Paola- testified that he was “surprised” when first told about the allegations during a meeting with the former commissioner. “Alex was an upright sergeant. He kept his subordinates in check. So naturally, someone might have been badly affected. At first I thought that this was some false allegation to get back at him [Schembri]” He said he had faced Schembri about the allegations. “Rest assured because there’s nothing in it. Everything is okay,” Schembri had insisted. Mallia also passed on to Assistant Commissioner Ramon Mercieca a chat handed to him by Schembri so that “if it was a false allegation, the truth would come out.” From then on, Mallia said he took a step back. It was not in his remit to investigate the matter which fell under his region. Asked by defence lawyer David Bonello, Mallia confirmed that at the time the allegations emerged, Schembri was also president of the Malta Police Association. A former superintendent stationed at Valletta for some nine months around the time of the allegations, when shown the anonymous letter testified that she had never seen it before and only heard about the allegations when summoned previously to the FCID. She was still learning the ropes when promoted in rank and took instructions from AC Mallia. But as for extra duties assignment, she mainly left that in the hands of detail officer Schembri “who was very well updated.” Together they attended pre-event meetings to figure out the manpower needed on the day. There were many events in the capital such as Festival Malta and Carnival, explained Maria Stella Attard. “But the detail officer was, in my opinion, excellent,” she went on. There were minor and recurring events which he handled alone, telling her “leave it to me.” Schembri would then email the detail to all units. But she “never, never” gave out instructions to the detail officer about extra duties, she said. Asked by the defence whether she had received any complaints in that regard, Attard said that there were a few from “some orderlies and some officers too.” The case continues. AG lawyers Maria Schembri and Etienne Savona prosecuted together with superintendent James Grech and inspector Christian Abela. Lawyer Lennox Vella was counsel to  Debrincat. Lawyers Joe Giglio and David Bonello appeared for Schembri. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Wife of ‘That ‘70s Show’ actor seeks divorce after rape sentence,AFP,"Actress Bijou Phillips filed for divorce from Danny Masterson less than two weeks after the former That ‘70s Show star was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for raping two women, US media reported Tuesday. The model and singer cited “irreconcilable differences” in her petition in a California court, celebrity news website TMZ reported. Masterson, found guilty in May of raping the two women in 2001 and 2003 at his home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, was sentenced on September 7 to 30 years to life in prison. The 47-year-old US actor, who has one child with Phillips, will not be able to seek parole until he is 77 years old. Phillips is seeking full custody of their daughter, aged nine, with visitation rights for Masterson, TMZ reported.  Her lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment by AFP. Phillips had stayed with Masterson through his two trials – the first was declared a mistrial last year after the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision. The jury in the retrial deadlocked on another rape charge against a third woman. That charge was dismissed. Masterson rose to fame with the 1998 launch of retro sitcom That ‘70s Show, where he played the character of Steven Hyde alongside fellow stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher. He co-starred again with Kutcher on Netflix’s The Ranch, but was fired in 2017 and written off the show after Los Angeles police confirmed they were investigating multiple rape allegations against the actor. The three women at the heart of the charges against Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time. Two of them said church officials had discouraged them from contacting law enforcement. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Van driver parks on double yellow line, then drives over policeman's foot",Edwina Brincat,"A driver who parked his van on a double yellow line, blocking a neighbour’s garage, landed into further trouble when he drove over a policeman’s foot, a court heard on Monday. It all started on Saturday morning when a woman called the police to report that her neighbour’s Ford Transit van was blocking her garage. A police sergeant went to the street in Birzebbuga at around 11:15am, finding the van parked on a double yellow line. Its owner, 27-year old Etienne Buttigieg, claimed that he had some trouble with the vehicle and could not move it. But then the officer noted that the number plates on the van actually belonged to another vehicle. He ordered the driver not to move. But Buttigieg drove off, right over the sergeant’s foot, that was fractured in the incident. He was tracked down later on Sunday at a Zejtun farmhouse where police also found the van involved in the incident. Buttigieg was arrested and escorted to court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges for having allegedly attacked and violently resisted the police officer, insulting and threatening both the officer and the neighbour, grievously injuring the sergeant and failing to obey legitimate orders. He also denied driving in a dangerous, negligent and reckless manner, without a licence and third-party insurance cover as well as using number plates belonging to another vehicle. Buttigieg was under a probation order issued almost a year ago and was allegedly a recidivist. The prosecution strongly objected to his request for bail, pointing out the risk of tampering with evidence and the fact that the accused had several past brushes with the law. Moreover, no public officer should suffer such injuries while carrying out his duties, argued the prosecutors. The defence countered that this was an “unfortunate incident” and the accused was very sorry for what happened. He could move to his mother’s home for bail purposes. Magistrate Natasha Galea Sciberras refused bail. Inspectors Doriette Cuschieri and Jonathan Cassar prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Anthony Stellini were defence counsel.

Court jails man for 30 years for 'barbaric' Marsa murder,Edwina Brincat,"A man was jailed for 30 years on Monday after he admitted to a fatal stabbing in July 2022. Ali Mahy Ezzo Saeed, a Sudanese national, pleaded guilty to murdering a 21-year-old Egyptian, Mahmoud Adly Qasim Gouda, in Triq Felicjan Bilocca, Marsa on July 24. He had initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea in the Criminal Court presided over by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera just before the start of a trial by jury.  When delivering judgment the court observed that several eyewitnesses had described how the accused had ""brutally"" stabbed the white-skinned 20-year old victim ""ten times"" with a knife.  One of them later explained how he ""felt himself going crazy"" as he saw the attack.  The accused dealt the blows ""all over"" until the victim collapsed in pools of blood.  The witness blocked the accused's efforts to get away by grabbing him by the feet while the police were alerted.  Another witness recalled how the accused ""mercilessly"" stabbed the youth.  He drew a knife from a pouch inside his trousers and stabbed the victim twice on the back.  Then when the victim turned round, Ezzo Saeed stabbed him on the chest.  His heart was pierced in the frenzied attack.  Pathologists who conducted the autopsy later reported that the victim suffered ""hypovolaemic shock"" due to perforation of the left ventricle on the left side of his chest.  After stabbing the victim on the chest, the accused still went after him, stabbing him again in the stomach.  He was ultimately restrained by other witnesses as he tried to escape.  The court observed that the accused had been convicted of a number of contraventions since he came to Malta. He had ""mercilessly"" stabbed the victim, observed the judge. The court could not allow such behavour to go unchecked.  ""What the accused did was nothing but a boundless barbaric act The accused carried a knife for no just reason whatsoever and simply pulled it out and used it to attack the victim.  At no point was the aggressor himself in danger.  The court said this was a ""very ugly murder  and the accused must be well and truly punished."" Although the accused had changed his not-guilty plea to an admission before the start of the trial, this was not at the earliest stages of the proceedings. He had, however, spared the court from wasting precious time and public funds.  That was to be taken into consideration when meting out punishment.  But the court needed to protect society.  Although wilful homicide carries a term of life imprisonment, in this case the circumstances merited a reduced punishment of 30-years, less the time spent under preventive custody.  The accused was also fined €116.47 as well as confiscation of all his property, both movable and immovable.  He must also cover all court expert expenses. During the compilation of evidence, a witness had described how he put his army training to good use when he ran after Saeed, caught him and disarmed him. He even dodged him when he flung the knife in his direction.  The witness, a Sierra Leone national had described how he went to Marsa to buy food when he saw the accused “throwing a punch at the deceased”. Both men were strangers to him but the minute he saw the accused pull out a knife, his military instinct kicked in. “As an ex-military soldier, when I see a knife I know what it means,"" the witness, Sesai Abdulla, explained, speaking in English while an Arab-speaking interpreter translated proceedings to the accused. After “the first two stabbings on the back,” there were two other blows on the victim’s chest and a fifth one on the right side of the abdomen, recalled Abdulla, gesturing to explain the location of the wounds. He dropped his foodstuffs and called the police but there was no reply. He then headed to the Marsa police station but found “no police”. As he rang the doorbell in vain, he heard a female voice directing him to the nearest police station at Ħamrun. Abdulla returned to the crime scene just in time to see the victim collapse near a parked delivery van, while the aggressor made his way through a narrow passage between some trees close by. “My friend, stay until the police come,” the witness told him. “How can I stay?” replied the man, whom the witness identified in court as the accused. “Yes, you have stabbed someone and you must stay until the police arrive,” insisted the witness. The man refused, waved his knife and lunged at him. But Abdulla dodged and hit back, he told the court. The man ran off and the witness and other people chased him. Abdulla said he grabbed the aggressor as he tried to clamber up a fence. He managed to lock his arm until he finally gave up and obeyed the order to put his knife back inside its case.  The witness said he felt “awful” as he watched the victim collapse, stretching his arms slowly forward as he lay on the ground, “a lot of blood” around him. “How can you stab your own brother? Even if he belongs to a different race,” remarked the witness. Even when Malta, he added, he would step in to save a life. “That is why I confronted the accused…I removed my shirt and tried to apply my safety precautions learnt in the army.” Another eyewitness, Nigerian national Mbali Mohammed, said: “I see one of my brothers fighting with one of my brothers. I told them to stop.” He clarified they were not actually ‘brothers’ and that he did not know their country of origin. As one pulled out a knife and stabbed the other, he shouted “stop!”. “He didn’t and he did it again,” he said, explaining that the victim was then stabbed in the upper right chest. Other people joined him in trying to break up the attack and then called an ambulance and the police as the aggressor ran away.  He said he grabbed a plastic object to defend himself against the armed man and ran after him. He was present when the accused was finally cornered and then handed over to the police. The victim fell to the ground, blood everywhere, as he and others tried to save him. “I felt sorry. When we saw him lying there, we decided to confront the accused.” He described the weapon as a long knife. “I saw it, real with my eyes…We tried to remove it so he would not kill another person.”  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Mexico extradites son of cartel kingpin 'El Chapo' to US,AFP,"Mexico on Friday extradited the son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman to the United States to face narcotics charges, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as ""El Raton"" or ""The Mouse,"" was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges linked to the fentanyl crisis plaguing the United States. His father was convicted in 2019 of running what was believed to be the world's biggest narcotics syndicate and is serving life in a supermax prison in the state of Colorado. Garland hailed the extradition as ""the most recent step in the Justice Department's effort to attack every aspect of the cartel's operations."" ""The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic that has devastated too many communities across the country."" The White House also lauded the extradition as part of ""ongoing cooperation"" with Mexico, a sign the administration of President Joe Biden is eager to get past the friction with Mexico over antinarcotics efforts. ""We thank our Mexican counterparts for their partnership in working to safeguard our peoples from violent criminals,"" said the statement by Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, released by the White House. Cooperation between Mexican and US security forces plunged last year after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador disbanded a unit that had worked closely with US Drug Enforcement Administration agents for more than a quarter century. The Mexican leader had accused US agents of ""abusive interference"" in his country's affairs. After Guzman's conviction, several of his sons, collectively known as ""the Little Chapos,"" inherited control of the Sinaloa Cartel, US authorities said. Security agents captured the younger Guzman in the Sinaloa city of Culiacan on January 5. The operation to capture the younger Guzman resulted in 29 deaths, including 10 military personnel and 19 alleged criminals in clashes and mayhem as cartel members tried to free him. Cartel members set vehicles on fire, an echo of the massive shootouts in 2019 when the younger Guzman was briefly detained but then freed to avoid bloodshed. At the time, US authorities had a $5 million bounty for his arrest, accusing him and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, of overseeing methamphetamine labs in Sinaloa state producing an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pounds of meth per month. ""Other information indicates that Ovidio Guzman Lopez has ordered the murders of informants, a drug trafficker, and a popular Mexican singer who had refused to sing at his wedding,"" according to a website of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ovidio Guzman, 33, will spend his first nights in a US prison just as his father's wife, Emma Coronel, walks free. Coronel, who is not Guzman's mother, was released from a California halfway house this week after completing a sentence for collaborating with Chapo Guzman in his narcotics activities. Coronel is a dual US-Mexican citizen. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Gozo Pride march assault should be treated as hate crime - Cyrus Engerer,Giulia Magri,"The Police Commissioner and the Home Affairs Ministry should treat an assault that took part after the Gozo Pride march on Saturday as a hate crime, Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer said on Friday.  Engerer was speaking during the third and final day of the LGBTIQ+ Human Rights Conference, organised as part of Europride.  Following the Gozo Pride march on Saturday, a man was assaulted when he tried to buy a drink from a bar. In an account issued to the media on Thursday, the victim said one of the bar’s patrons sprinted towards him and punched his face and head.  “What happened in a bar in Gozo shows how much we still need to work to ensure that hate is eliminated from these islands,” Cyrus said in his opening speech.  “The Police Commissioner and the Home Affairs Minister must treat this assault as a hate crime against a group of LGBTIQ people celebrating their pride in Gozo last week.” Speaking to Times of Malta, a police source said the police received a call early on Sunday morning at around 1.30am informing them of an argument that broke out. When they went on site, they found the victim.  The source said the case is being treated as aggression but investigations are being carried out to find the aggressor (who fled the scene) and the motive behind the attack. Engerer said that while Malta is known to have the best LGBTIQ laws in Europe, it does not mean there is equality on the island. A close friend and his partner, who is a third country national, will not be taking part in Saturday’s Pride March because of the discrimination they had to suffer. “The partner experiences discrimination every day. He is gay but he is not white or European, he lives in Malta and is only defined as a third-country national.” Engerer said human rights are universal, and should not be seen as a luxury or a privilege.  “Our rights are not granted by politicians or governments, but they are ours,” he added, and it is the government’s job to protect such rights.  “Until we are all equal, none of us are…"" For his opening speech, Engerer was wearing a t-shirt with a message of solidarity with the El Hiblu 3.  The El Hiblu 3 - Amara, Kader, and Abdalla- were among a group of 108 migrants crossing from Libya in a dinghy when they were rescued by the merchant vessel El Hiblu 1 in 2019. International human rights advocates are calling on the attorney general to drop terrorism charges against the three young men, who are accused of commandeering a ship and threatening its crew after they were rescued at sea.    Opposition Speaker for Equality Graziella Attard Previ also deplored the assault that took place last weekend.  “The community cannot fully enjoy the universal human rights that are offered to them on paper when they run the risk of hate crime and hate speech on social media,” she said. She said being part of the LGBTIQ+ community is not all about pride, partying and having fun, but also about remembering and fighting for those who suffer in silence, who are afraid of homophobic actions and being discriminated against.  “While the younger generation is more open about their sexuality, we cannot forget the elderly and middle-aged groups who are still in the closet,” she added.  Following a discussion ""Pride Under Attack"", one of the panelists, Ukrainian activist and organiser of Kyiv Pride Edward Reese, was gifted a Gilbert Baker Flag.  Artist Gilbert Baker designed the first rainbow flag back in 1978. Years later, the flag is still proudly displayed as a symbol of the LGBTQ rights movement and Pride.    It was explained that the flag was produced in 2003 for the flag's 25th anniversary and was later cut up into small pieces and handed out to cities where LGBTIQ+ communities continue to fight for their rights.  President of the Gilbert Baker Foundation Charley Beal and the US Embassy’s Public Affairs Officer Elizabeth Canellakis presented the flag to Reese as a message of hope to Ukraine, and in support of LGBTIQ+ civilians fighting in the war.

Italian police find stolen treasures at Australian museum,AFP,"Italian art detectives have found stolen ancient treasures at a leading Australian university, including an artefact likely smuggled out of the country under piles of pasta, the institution said Friday. Australian National University (ANU) said Friday it was working with the ""specialist art squad"" of Italy's Carabinieri military police to return the priceless pieces. The looted works discovered within the university's classics museum included a 2,500-year-old amphora depicting Greek champion Heracles fighting the mythical Nemean lion. Italian police discovered an old Polaroid photo of the Heracles vase while investigating an unnamed art thief, which led them to believe it had been illegally plundered before it was sent to Australia. The Canberra university said it had bought the vase in ""good faith"" at a Sotheby's auction in 1984, and was ""proud"" to work with Italian investigators to see it returned to its rightful home. Museum curator Georgia Pike-Rowney described the vase, which dates back to 530 BC, as a ""stunning example"" of ancient Mediterranean craftsmanship. Working in tandem with the museum, the Carabinieri also identified a stolen red fish plate from the Italian region of Apulia which they were able to trace to David Holland Swingler, an American art trafficker and food importer known for a culinary modus operandi. ""During trips to Italy, Swingler sourced material directly from tombaroli - literally 'tomb robbers' who undertake illegal excavations,"" Pike-Rowney said. She added that Swingler ""then smuggled the items to the US hidden among bundles of pasta and other Italian foods"". Spurred to undertake its own audit, the Australian National University subsequently found a Roman marble head that belonged to a separate collection owned by the Vatican. ""Conversations about the repatriation of ancient artefacts have become prominent in recent years, as institutions across the world grapple with the legacies of historical collection practices,"" said Pike-Rowney. ""As Australia's national university, ANU must be at the forefront of best practice in managing restitution and repatriation cases."" Italy's government has agreed to loan the vase and the fish plate to the university until they are returned at a ""future date"".

Man found guilty of trying to export stuffed protected birds,James Cummings,"A Dutch national was fined €7,000 and suspended from obtaining wildlife trade licenses for three years on Monday after he was found guilty of attempting to export several stuffed protected birds.  The court also ordered the confiscation of 15 birds of different species which were found in the man's suitcase by customs officials as he tried to leave the country. The birds were found in a box checked as bulky luggage during security checks at the airport earlier in September as the man attempted to fly to the UK, with the majority belonging to a protected species, according to the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA). ""The contents of the box raised the suspicion of Airport Security personnel who passed it through an X-ray machine and alerted ERA officials,"" said ERA in a statement.  ""Upon examining the contents in the presence of customs officers, ERA officials determined that the majority were protected species originating from Northern Europe, Africa and South America."" The man's arrest and tracing of the birds was the result of joint investigations by ERA, police, customs and Malta International Airport security, the authority said.     Reacting to the judgement, environmental and conservation NGO Birdlife Malta said the case was ""proof of the worrying situation of illegal hunting in Malta and abroad by Maltese hunters"", who it said were successfully managing to smuggle animal carcasses in and out of the country.  ""Taxidermists in Malta, some of whom organise these hunting trips abroad, are actually illegally mounting these into stuffed birds for collections and illegal trade,"" the group wrote on Facebook.  Describing illegal hunting in Malta and abroad as ""well-organised crime"", Birdlife Malta said there had been a ""massive push in changing laws to soften enforcement of taxidermy in particular. ""The continued pressure by the hunting lobby to dilute and dismantle legal protection and to institutionalise loopholes in the same laws is evidently motivated by the same interest. ""While the apprehension of one culprit is a one-off, the trade of illegally shot-protected birds in Malta is a very common activity and is the main reason why hunters are eager to shoot down protected birds all year round,"" the NGO said.  In June, European environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius said the European Commission (EC) was “left without a choice” but to take legal action against Malta over bird hunting and trapping. “Unfortunately, Malta did not prohibit (hunting and trapping) and that left the Commission without a choice but to refer Malta to the European Court of Justice,” he said.  Two years ago, the EC took Malta to the European Court of Justice for violating a ban on finch trapping. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Stolen Van Gogh returned in IKEA bag 'damaged but restorable',AFP,"The precious Vincent Van Gogh painting stolen then sensationally returned to a Dutch art sleuth in an Ikea bag has been scratched but should be reparable, its museum director told AFP Wednesday. Thieves snatched the Van Gogh masterpiece ""Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring"" in the middle of the night in 2020 while the painting was on loan to a museum near Amsterdam from its home at the Groninger Museum in the northern Netherlands.  The painting, worth up to €6 million, was then returned on Monday to Arthur Brand, known as the ""Indiana Jones"" of the art world for his work in researching and recovering stolen artworks.    Brand took possession of the painting bound in bubble wrap, a pillow case and stuffed in a blue Ikea bag, but the work still appears to have sustained some damage.  ""It is damaged by scratches so it's not in a perfect state but it's restorable,"" Groninger Museum director Andreas Bluhm told AFP in an interview. ""When it's there in the IKEA bag, of course it was hot, so this is not ideal. It had already suffered for three and a half years,"" he said, adding: ""But then bringing it in that same bag is quite safe because it's the least conspicuous way of moving it. Nobody would suspect anything."" The painting is now at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where it is being examined, he said, adding that it could be some time before the work is available to the public.  ""Even the restorer cannot tell you how long it will take. Probably months rather than weeks,"" he said.  What offers some hope for a successful restoration is that Van Gogh painted the work on paper glued to a thick wooden panel, rather than on canvas, so scratches should be superficial. Bluhm said the time between the robbery and the recovery had been a rollercoaster of emotions. The piece had never before left his museum, so its theft came as a hammer blow.  ""The painting is part of our museum's identity and our collective collection. So that hurt even more,"" he said.  Then came news last Thursday of a possible return, giving him sleepless nights.  ""They said 'please come to Amsterdam to identify the painting'. I said 'OK, but I'll believe it when I see it'."" ""You constantly keep on thinking about it but at the same time you don't want to hope too much because it could still fail,"" he said. When the painting was finally identified, he went straight to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam to give them an almighty surprise. ""They didn't even know I was coming. I called and said 'I'm coming, are you there? Can you open the door and let me in. I have something for you'.""   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

"Transport Malta corruption whistleblower to testify, court rules",Edwina Brincat,"A court on Wednesday upheld a whistleblower's request to testify in proceedings about an alleged driving licence racket at Transport Malta.  The whistleblower, who also claims there is widespread voter fraud, was allegedly forced to leave the country after his residence permit was unexpectedly revoked. The man, whom independent candidate Arnold Cassola refers to through the pseudonym Aziz, worked as a translator with Transport Malta by assisting candidates who spoke neither Maltese nor English during their driving exam. Identity Malta has denied that ID cards of foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to foreign residents to vote for the PL.  In August, the whistleblower filed an application seeking to testify in the case which implicates other high-profile people including a ""minister."" On Wednesday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request as she presided over a court case against Clint Mansueto, Raul Antonio Pace and Philip Edrick Zammit who stand accused of corruption as former officials at the transport watchdog.  The prosecution said that it requested the witness to testify via video conferencing.  Although his application dealt with ""other matters not related to this case"" the prosecutors would likely put questions to test the credibility of the witness.  The court requested information as to the witness's whereabouts.  But AG lawyer Abigail Caruana Vella explained that the police inspector did not have information as to where the whistleblower lived abroad.  ""However the police have spoken to him via video call,"" added the prosecuting lawyer. The witness will testify at a future sitting, with the date still to be determined. However, the prosecution is expected to inform court of the place from where he will testify before he actually testifies. The man, through his lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta, had filed a second application requesting to testify after his first application was not decreed upon by the court. The reason for that was that the magistrate could not take cognisance of his request since at the time of filing, the records were at the AG's office. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are assisting Mansueto. Lawyer Joe Giglio is assisting Pace. Lawyer Herman Mula is assisting Zammit.

Doctors who certified benefit fraudsters: 'we were cheated too',Mark Laurence Zammit,"Doctors on the medical board that greenlighted fraudulent disability benefit applications have defended their actions, claiming there was no way they could have detected the fraud. “We were as shocked as everyone else to learn of the racket because it was designed in a way that makes it impossible for the board members to know if an application was fraudulent,” one doctor said. “We feel like we have been cheated as well.” Six doctors and sources close to the government-appointed medical board spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity, saying they must be cautious given that police investigations and court cases are still ongoing.  RELATED STORIES  They said the fraudulent applicants seemed to have every single document in order and the medical certificates appeared to be signed and rubberstamped under the hospital’s official letterhead by their colleagues who they know, trust and had worked with for a long time. In reality, those signatures were forged, allowing millions of euros in taxpayer’s money to be diverted to people claiming serious illness they did not have. “The doctors who appeared to have signed the documents are our colleagues, mentors and friends. Some of them taught us at the university, they work diligently and are professionals of great principle and integrity and we trust them blindly,” one source said. “We knew they would never certify someone as having a condition they did not really have. So, when we saw their signatures and rubberstamps on medical certificates, we never doubted it for a second.” Asked why they did not conduct sporadic checks on the authenticity of the certificates, the sources said the board was never instructed to work in that manner. “In hindsight, now that everybody knows there was a racket, it’s easy to say we should have checked whether there were forged documents. But, back then, we had absolutely no reason to doubt the documents’ authenticity,” another source said. “In our decades-long careers we have never seen anything like this... we’ve never seen anything of this magnitude,” another said. They said they only realised there was a racket when the police called them to inform them of the discovery of forged documents and when their colleagues – who had their signatures forged – told them about it.   The government-appointed medical board came under the spotlight after Times of Malta revealed earlier this month that former Labour MP Silvio Grixti was implicated in a racket that saw scores of people – possibly hundreds – access disability benefits they were not entitled to. He has, so far, not been charged with his suspected key role in the racket. Police investigations indicated Grixti, who at the time was a backbench MP, would allegedly give people an envelope containing forged medical documents certified by several Maltese consultants, all saying that they examined the benefit claimant and found them to be suffering from a severe disability. The revelations have since raised questions over why the board, which is tasked with validating the applications, did not notice the fraudulent applications. But doctors and sources close to the medical board told Times of Malta it is not fair for people to turn the guns on them because the way the board works makes it impossible to detect a dishonest application. “Imagine this: an applicant comes before you saying they suffer from epilepsy. There is no way you can assess the symptoms of a condition like that during an interview and you are asked to decide on the application there and then, so you must rely on medical certificates. ""The applicant hands you medical certificates signed by doctors you trust blindly, confirming they really have the condition and, according to the benefit criteria, they are truly eligible for the benefit. What do you do? You have no option but to green-light that application,” one source explained. “That is why many board interviews lasted all of five minutes. It’s not that we were carelessly shunning our responsibilities but when you open the envelope and see a trusted doctor’s signature confirming a disability which qualifies for the benefit, that’s all you need to know – it’s case closed in a few minutes. You must approve it.” All the sources denied they were complicit in the racket or suspected their colleagues and said they never received calls from people in higher authority to let dishonest applications slide. The board is comprised of around 20 physicians and every application is assessed by a rotating panel of three people – two doctors and a board secretary. Speaking to Times of Malta on Monday, a neurologist who had his signature forged on the documents of at least 30 fraudulent applications, said the documents were “literal photocopies” and were almost all identical. Senior neurologist Anthony Galea Debono said the writing was illegible, had a rubberstamp he had not used in around six years, the text was riddled with grammatical errors and did not make medical sense. He said this led him to question how the doctors on the medical board had not smelt a rat when they came across a series of “such nonsense”. “How is it possible that none of them noticed they were presented with 30 identical photocopies of certificates,” he asked. “It was sheer incompetence. One wonders whether they were really medically qualified.”   But the medical board sources insisted that, since the doctors rotated, it was very unlikely for the same doctor to come across two photocopied certificates and, even if they did, they would have seen the second one weeks – or even months – after the first one, making it virtually impossible for any doctor to remember or compare the similarities. Times of Malta has seen several forged medical documents, some of which were written in virtually illegible handwriting. Some consultants said they could not even read the handwriting that was on documents that had their signature. “Since the racket was uncovered, we changed practices and are dealing with applications differently,” one medical board source said. Grixti was himself appointed to the government medical board in 2013 and served as one of the doctors who validated social benefits applications around the beginning of the Labour administration. According to sources, however, the forging of documents appears to have started after he had stopped serving on the board. Times of Malta also sent questions to the director general of the social security department – Grazio Barbara – on why so many fraudulent applications went unnoticed by the board. He said the independent board that was appointed last week to evaluate the process of how benefits are awarded will also look into “the medical verification of applications”. Barbara said the board has also been tasked with making recommendations and their report will serve as a basis for any further actions. Asked whether the Social Security Department has taken any action against any of the medical board members, he said that the authorities will follow the instructions of the police and cooperate fully “should the police instruct any action following its investigations”. “However, it must also be stated that,  in the first months of 2022, stricter due diligence was imposed on the medical review procedures,” he said. “This intensified after a number of suspect cases were detected by the income support and compliance division in September 2022.” Editorial note: The Medical Board is made up of 19 doctors whose names are publicly available. However, not all members of the board took part in assessments for severe disability benefits concerning epilepsy.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Explosives-laden drone 'neutralised' on roof of Ecuador prison,AFP,"Ecuadoran police defused an explosives-laden drone Tuesday on the roof of a prison in a complex that has been the scene of gruesome inmate massacres committed by rival gangs. Interior Minister Juan Zapata posted photos on X, formerly Twitter, of the drone he described as an ""explosive device"" perched on the roof of La Roca maximum security jail in Guayaquil. The prison holds some of Ecuador's most dangerous criminals, including six Colombians suspected in the killing of presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio last month. Zapata said the drone was ""intended to be brought into"" the prison. The minister posted a video hours later of the device being blown up, all but destroying the roof of the detention facility. He said a specialized team ""neutralised the drone,"" and all prisoners in the affected area had been transferred somewhere else for their safety. Ecuador, until a few years ago a peaceful haven nestled between the world's largest cocaine producers - Colombia and Peru, has recently descended into violence as it has itself become a hub for drug trafficking. Rival gangs with links to Colombian and Mexican cartels regularly clash in prisons, with more than 430 inmates killed since 2021, often leaving a trail of burned and dismembered bodies. The homicide rate in the country of 18.3 million rose to a record 26 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2022, almost double the previous year and higher than the rates in Colombia, Mexico or Brazil. The city most affected by the violence has been the sprawling port of Guayaquil in the southwest, used by the fast-expanding drug trade to smuggle narcotics to Europe and the United States. In 2021, the SNAI prison authority reported an attack with drones on the Guayaquil prison complex that includes La Roca. There were no casualties, but major damage to the prison roofs. The country's prisons have become dens of crime due to ""the increasingly acute state absence... that has caused part of the prison population to become effectively hostages of criminal gangs that have much influence, also in politics,"" Billy Navarrete of the CDH rights watchdog told AFP. The violence has spread to all spheres of life, and on August 9, Villavicencio was gunned down in Quito ahead of a first round of voting in Ecuador's general elections. A second round is scheduled for October 15. A mayor, a national lawmaker and a local political leader have also been killed during the election campaign.

Hitman in Sliema jogger assault 'instructed to act' by Matthew Schembri,Edwina Brincat,"A man who last week was evasive when testifying about an attack on a Sliema jogger, confirmed on Monday he had been “instructed to act” by his former boss Matthew Joseph Schembri.  Agostin Marku, a 23-year-old Albanian national has just served jail time over the unprovoked attack in June last year alongside fellow national Xhovano Ndoci. The 23-year-old Albanian nationals were - until a few weeks ago - jointly accused with Schembri. Their unsuspecting target was the 62-year-old father of Schembri’s ex-wife. He was assaulted by Marku and Ndoci one morning in June 2022 while out on his daily jog.  The hitmen later changed their plea to guilty and were both sentenced to an effective prison term and a €116 fine each. Marku was sentenced to 22 months while Ndoci got a 20-month jail term. Since neither of the men filed an appeal, that judgment was final and both became competent and compellable witnesses in the ongoing proceedings against Schembri.  When testifying last week as prosecution witnesses in Schembri’s ongoing proceedings, the pair gave somewhat contrasting versions, with Marku insisting that he could not remember everything since “it all happened over a year ago”. He said that he had just gone after the jogger and hit him. Although he was aware that the man had some problems with his boss, he was not sure what those problems were about, he had said. However, his accomplice Ndoci, confirmed that it was Schembri who showed him a photo of the victim and also promised payment. In light of such discrepancies and the reasonable suspicion that Marku had not testified the whole truth, the court ordered that the witness should testify again on Monday. When he took the witness stand on Monday, assisted by two interpreters translating from Maltese to English and then Albanian, Marku initially appeared reluctant to speak.  “Excuse me but I don’t want to speak any further about this case,” he started off.  Magistrate Victor George Axiak pointed out that he was compelled to testify and warned the witness that unless he did so, he would face criminal action.  Another witness, Ndoci, had testified at the previous sitting, explained the magistrate.  “Do you wish to confirm all you said previously or do you want to change anything,"" asked the court.  “Yes. May I speak to a lawyer,"" asked the witness.  The court explained that at that stage, the witness could not communicate with his lawyer.  Marku said that he did not intend to change anything, sticking to his previous testimony and explaining that he had “said whatever [he] remembered as correct and there was nothing to add”. Questioned by prosecuting Inspector Lydon Zammit, Marku again insisted that he could not remember the nature of the problems between Schembri and the victim.  “It’s been one and a half years since the incident,"" he added. “What were you and your friend carrying on the day of the incident,” asked Zammit.  “My friend was carrying a knife but I had nothing,” said Marku, explaining that the weapon was “just as self-defence in case someone attacked them”. Marku was unable to answer further questions: “I don’t recall,” he insisted. Confronted by what he had told police during interrogation, the witness said that “maybe” he remembered having been shown a photo of the target on Schembri’s mobile phone and that “maybe” it was Schembri who gave him information about the jogger.  “I can’t recall it 100%,” said Marku.  That was when Magistrate Axiak cut short the questioning and ordered the witness’ immediate arrest.  Marku was to be escorted to the court lockup and detained there for an hour or so until the hearing resumed.  When the proceedings continued, Marku said that Schembri had promised no payment, neither before the hit nor afterwards.  When Schembri’s lawyers suggested that the witness had never spoken directly to his former boss about the assault, Marku replied: “yes, I spoke to him and it was the three of us.” “Does Schembri speak Albanian,” asked lawyer Arthur Azzopardi.  “No,” replied the witness, explaining that work instructions were translated by his Albanian colleague who had a better grasp of English.  “Could it be that no instructions had been given but that he [Marku] had heard Schembri complain about that person [the victim] and interpreted that as instructions,” asked defence lawyer Franco Debono.  “Yes, he told me to act,"" Marku replied. “In light of your knowledge of English, how confident are you as to Matthew Schembri’s intention,” pressed on Debono.  “I’m 100% sure that I was asked to act,” came the final reply.  “The witness may now leave,” directed Magistrate Axiak, as Marku’s lawyer, Charles Mercieca, asked whether “this chapter” was now closed.  As the witness exited the courtroom, Inspector Zammit informed the court that a deportation order was expected to be issued in Marku’s respect by the Principal Immigration Officer “in the coming hours.”  The prosecution then declared that it had wrapped up its evidence.  The case continues. Inspector Lydon Zammit prosecuted. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono are defence counsel. Lawyer Alex Scerri Herrera appeared parte civile. Lawyer Charles Mercieca assisted Marku.     You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Medical Council not yet investigating benefit fraud racket,James Cummings,"There is currently no investigation by the Medical Council into the huge disability benefit fraud racket revealed last week or the family doctor and ex-Labour MP implicated in it. The council’s president, lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace, said it was awaiting the outcome of a criminal investigation, describing the situation as “early days”. “We might get the ball rolling to start our own [investigation] if more details surface,” he said. One of the council’s functions is to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against medical professionals and it also has the legal power to issue sanctions.   Micallef Stafrace said the council was monitoring the situation after Times of Malta revealed ‘hundreds’ of people had received thousands of euros in disability benefits they were not entitled to. “If any doctors are mentioned by name specifically, they will be investigated accordingly,” he added. When asked if an investigation had been opened into ex-Labour MP and popular family doctor Silvio Grixti – who was implicated in the scheme after claimants said he supplied false documents to them – he replied that the council still had to meet to discuss the matter. No investigation into Grixti was underway, he confirmed, adding the council had only become aware of the investigation when the public did.    Earlier this year, a court threw out Medical Council proceedings concerning another doctor-politician, PN MP Stephen Spiteri, who it was investigating for having allegedly issued medical certificates without examining patients.    Reacting to the recent developments, council president Micallef Stafrace said the news of the case had “worried” the council because, “if true, it could mean that it has been going on for years.” The council has faced calls to take action – not only against Grixti – but also against members of the medical board, who are responsible for assessing benefit applications before giving them the green light. Back in 2021, Times of Malta revealed that Grixti had resigned from parliament after being interrogated by the police over irregular documents.   Earlier this month, Times of Malta exposed how he was at the centre of a racket involving potentially hundreds of people falsely claiming serious disability benefit payments. In most cases the ‘disability of choice’ is understood to have been frequent epileptic fits. Grixti is alleged to have given those involved an envelope containing forged medical documents confirming the condition, as well as a Transport Malta document stating that the person had given up their driving license, a requirement for those suffering from frequent seizures. Claimants would then be assessed by a government medical board, which some told police would take just “five minutes.” The applications presented to the board used forged signatures of several consultants. Neurologist Anthony Galea Debono, who was one of those whose signature was forged, called for the names of the medical board’s directors to be made public and action taken against those who were found to have approved a spate of identical false documents. The Medical Council, he said, was duty-bound to take action and could even strike doctors off the register. The head of the Malta Medical Association Martin Balzan has also branded the racket “organised crime,” saying the scale of the operation suggested it “came from above.” Caritas Malta Epilepsy Association committee secretary Robin Pinkston said the fraud amounted to “more than merely stealing money.” So far, some 141 people have been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to, though this figure is expected to rise as the investigation continues.

"Man tried to rape masseuse after being denied massage parlour sex, court told",Edwina Brincat,"A man attempted to rape a masseuse in Birkirkara after he was thrown out of another massage parlour in Pietá for demanding sex, a court heard on Monday. The incident allegedly took place on September 6, between 4 and 7pm, when the 32-year-old St Julian's resident first turned up at a parlour at Pieta'. He asked for a massage, then stripped naked, lay down on a sofa and asked the masseuse for a sexual service. But the woman refused downright, kicked the client out and threw his clothes onto the street. The man apparently then tested his luck at another parlour in Birkirkara – but did not take no for an answer. On Monday, the police escorted him to court, where he pleaded not guilty to attempting non consensual sexual acts, holding the woman against her will, subjecting her to acts of sexual connotations, caused her harm, fear of violence as well as insults and threats. His lawyer, Roberta Bonello, did not request bail but asked that the man be placed under a treatment order, arguing that he suffers from psychiatric problems. Inspector Joseph Busuttil agreed with the need for a psychiatric assessment, adding that the accused was under constant watch at the police lockup. The court, presided by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, upheld the request and appointed a psychiatrist to assess the accused immediately upon admission to jail. It also issued a treatment order and a probation order, to last for the duration of court proceedings. Attorney general lawyer Cynthia Tomassuolo together with Inspectors Joseph Busuttil and Andrew Agius Bonello prosecuted. Lawyer Roberta Bonello was defence counsel.

‘Infuriated’: Epilepsy patients react to benefits fraud revelations,James Cummings,"Epilepsy patients and their families are infuriated by the news that scores of people received state benefit payments by falsely claiming they had the condition. “Families and persons with epilepsy are infuriated about these cases of fraud which have contributed to the increased stigmatisation of individuals with genuine medical conditions,” said Caritas Malta Epilepsy Association committee secretary Robin Pinkston. “Such cases can also lead to misunderstandings, discrimination and social isolation for those who are already dealing with the challenges of epilepsy,” she said. Pinkston was reacting to news that hundreds of people were falsely diagnosed as severely epileptic and paid roughly €450 a month in disability benefits, as part of a massive racket involving falsified medical documents that dates back years.  Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to, but the figure is expected to climb even higher as police continue to comb through all 761 applications that were awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022. Family doctor and former Labour Party MP Silvio Grixti was allegedly at the heart of the racket, though some beneficiaries say they obtained the false epilepsy diagnosis without Grixti's help.  “The theft of state resources allocated specifically to those persons with employment difficulties caused by lifelong disabilities and health conditions is more than merely stealing money,” continued Pinkston. “It is a gross violation of the social welfare system which recognises some people’s genuine difficulties in seeking and/or maintaining employment due to long-term disabilities,” she said, adding such cases throw an “unjust and unfavourable light” on genuine patients. Describing the neurologists and other specialist medical professionals at Mater Dei as “extremely dedicated professionals,” Pinkston said the association “strongly condemns” the forging of their signatures as part of the scheme. In Malta, there are around 4,000 people with epilepsy, a condition that “anyone can develop” due to a genetic tendency, stroke, head injury or infection, according to the association. While an estimated 70 per cent of patients successfully manage their condition with medication and around 80 per cent are able enjoy long periods of time without seizures, others may struggle with forms of epilepsy that are resistant to treatment. The association stressed that not every person with epilepsy qualifies for financial assistance, with only those suffering from four or more seizures per month and having surrendered their driving licence able to claim for the condition. To fulfil these criteria, those involved in the benefit fraud racket were given false Transport Malta declarations saying they had given up their licence in addition to the forged medical documents, allegedly supplied by Grixti. Sources say the racket could have begun even before 2019.  Beneficiaries who spoke to Times of Malta said they were given access to the fraudulent scheme through political connections.  One medical consultant whose signature was forged as part of the scheme said he and his colleagues felt ""raped and cheated"" and asked how the medical board tasked with screening disability benefit applicants had not picked up on any of the fraudulent claims.  Another medical consultant whose signature was forged, Medical Association of Malta (MAM) president Martin Balzan, has called the benefit fraud racket “organised crime” and said the scale of the scheme suggests it “came from above”. “This is wrong. Cheating the system is wrong. That money is for people who are seriously disabled,” he said. Prime Minister Robert Abela has said he learnt of the allegations in late 2021 and immediately forced Grixti to resign his parliamentary seat. But the government made no attempt to identify or fix problems with the system until last Saturday, when the Social Policy Ministry announced that a three-person board has been appointed to analyse the system and advise on how to improve it.

We felt ‘raped and cheated’: specialist whose signature was forged speaks out,Mark Laurence Zammit,"A neurologist has said he and other consultants felt “raped” when they found out their signatures had been forged on false medical documents in the huge benefits fraud racket exposed by Times of Malta. Anthony Galea Debono also said not enough was being done to pin down the people “higher up” involved in the racket. All neurologists and neurosurgeons registered in Malta were affected by the abuse and felt “cheated”, he added. The angry senior neurologist was among several consultants who learned that dozens of people had received thousands of euros in disability benefits they were not entitled to, by means of the doctors’ forged signatures. His rubberstamp and signature are on the forged documents of at least 30 people who were receiving the benefit fraudulently. He has learned that four of these people – who are understood to have claimed they suffered from epilepsy – are working as taxi drivers, and he questioned how they kept their driving licence while claiming to be suffering from such a severe disability. “I am now at a point where nothing really makes me angry anymore in this country. But I am incensed that they used my forged signature,” Galea Debono said.  RELATED STORIES  He said he was treated very courteously by police but hopes the investigation looks “higher up” where it should be looking. Earlier this month, Times of Malta revealed that in a years-long racket, people often hailing from Labour strongholds received around €450 monthly, collectively defrauding millions in taxpayer money. Only people who have specific, rare, severe disabilities are eligible for the benefit, and in some cases they need to provide medical certificates from a consultant, to confirm they do suffer from the illness. Those certificates must then be presented to a medical board that is meant to assess each application before giving the green light for the bene­fit to be issued.   Investigators believe this is why Galea Debono and other consultants had their signatures forged – because the documents were essential to make the fraudu­lent applicants seem eligible. An association representing epilepsy patients in Malta has said its members are ""infuriated"" by the racket, which it said undermines genuine patients and adds to stigma surrounding benefits for severe disability.  Galea Debono said the police provided him with a copy of the documents that were forged in his name. The documents appear to confirm he had examined the claimants and certified that they suffered from a medical condition that made them eligible for the benefit – except that he had never seen the people in his life, and as far as he was concerned, they suffered from no such condition. He said documents in his name were almost invariably identical for all 30 patients – “literal photocopies”. They were illegible, had a rubberstamp he had not used in around six years, the text was riddled with grammatical errors and did not make medical sense. This led him to question how the doctors on the medical board assessing the applications had not smelt a rat when they came across a series of “such nonsense”. “How is it possible that none of them noticed they were presented with 30 identical photocopies of certificates?” he asked. “It was sheer incompetence. One wonders whether they were really medically qualified.” Galea Debono has, in the past, drafted the Social Security Department’s requirements for epileptics to be able to access benefits. He said they would need to have more than four seizures a month to qualify, which would indicate they were “quite disabled” and living a disrupted life. He believes the claimants who were receiving the money fraudulently are “as guilty as those who forged the documents” and that “they should be given a community service sentence and made to clean hospitals”, rather than a suspended sentence. The majority of those arraigned in court have admitted to the charges and agreed to return their ill-gotten gains, getting off with a suspended sentence for defrauding the government. Some have already returned all the money but most of them have been reaching repayment agreements with the Social Security Department to return the amounts in monthly instalments. Galea Debono explained how relatively few people in Malta are eligible for the severe disability assistance because the eligible illnesses are very rare. Some illnesses, like the Congeni­tal Insensitivity to Pain and Leopard’s Syndrome, are so rare that “you can count the number of people who suffer from them on one hand”, he said. “This means there are many people who have other severe disabilities and who deserve such a benefit but cannot apply for it, and that is very sad indeed,” he said. “Persons with an illness and in dire straits should find appropriate assistance from the Department of Social Security and not fake signatures to help them out.” He believes the names of the board’s doctors should be made public and action taken against those who are found to have approved a spate of identical false documents. The Medical Council, he said, was duty bound to take action and could even strike involved doctors off the register. Times of Malta revealed that claimants told police investigators that family doctor and former Labour MP Silvio Grixti had provided them with the forged documents.   But sources said the racket became so well-known within Labour circles that it took a life of its own, with some claimants telling police they obtained the forged certificates from people other than Grixti. Following the revelations, the Social Policy Ministry confirmed that 141 people have been ordered to refund €2.1 million in fraudulent benefits, and that €330,000 have already been recouped. But that figure is expected to climb even higher as police continue to comb through all 761 applications that were awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022. Dozens of claimants who benefitted from the racket have already been charged and more people are expected to be arraigned in the coming weeks. Investigators are not excluding the possibility that the racket began before 2019. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Benefit fraud: 'Big fish' will not get preferential treatment - Robert Abela,Daniel Ellul,"The “big fish” in the benefit fraud case that saw hundreds get money by fraudulently claiming disability will not be given preferential treatment, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Sunday.  Abela was replying to questions from Malta Daily editor Keane Cutajar in front of the Labour Party club in Marsaxlokk.  “The alleged big fish in this case will not be given preferential treatment,” he said.  Last Sunday, Times of Malta revealed that former PL MP Silvio Grixti was at the centre of a fraudulent severe disability benefits scheme that saw millions of euros fraudulently given to people who were not eligible.   RELATED STORIES  Times of Malta then interviewed three of the illicit benefit recipients, including a man who said a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the benefits fraud racket in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. Abela said that many of those who benefitted from the scheme were vulnerable people even if they were not eligible for the severe disability pension.  “Others capitalised on their vulnerability, whether they did it for their own profit or not will be for the court to decide,” Abela said.  The government, he insisted will not tolerate anyone who used the country’s social safety net for personal gain.  But the racket was in no way organised by Castille, the prime minister said.  “It is shameful that people are saying that this came for Castille to buy votes, when the opposite is the truth. Castille had immediately stopped the abuse and reported everything to the police,” he said.   Abela said that an administrative investigation to look into the way severe disability benefits are dished out has now also been launched. Speaking about third-country-nationals, Abela said foreign workers were important in many sectors including health, certain expertise, and “humble” jobs that the Maltese no longer wanted to do.  A strategic exercise between Identity Malta and Jobs Plus, he said, meant that work permits are not being automatically accepted but are being considered only if they fulfil the needs of the country.  “Yes to worker in the sectors that need foreign workers but no to individuals who submit 1,000 applications”. Abela reiterated that the government will not tolerate those “who see foreign workers as a number to quickly profit from” even if they do not really have a job to give to the worker when they arrived. He said recently that the government will not back businesses that were focused solely on importing foreign workers. “We are being very strong on this... where there is no need for foreign workers, we will be saying no, foreign workers will come to this country according to the need,” he said. He added that importing too many foreign workers could lead the salaries of Maltese workers to stagnate when foreign workers should help improve the quality of life of the Maltese and not contribute to worsening conditions. Abela also promised that the Budget for 2024 will retain the energy subsidies and give an additional cost of living adjustment to low income earners.

Benefit fraud: PN asks people to unite in protest on Monday evening,Times of Malta,"The Nationlist Party has called on the people to unite in protest in front of Parliament on Monday evening. In a statement, it accused the government of defending the benefit fraud racket ""born at Castille"" and of which only Labour benefitted in the last election. The party had earlier called for parliament to convene urgently on Monday to debate the scandal.   But the government did not agree with the proposal. Times of Malta revealed last Sunday that former Labour MP Silvio Grixti, a popular family doctor, has been implicated in a years-long racket to help “hundreds” of people receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to. The claimants received monthly payments averaging €450 from the social security department. Evidence seen by Times of Malta indicates Grixti, a popular family doctor, provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive monthly social benefits for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. The fraud saw the claimants receive monthly payments averaging €450 from the social security department. Times of Malta has now interviewed three of the illicit benefit recipients, including a man who said a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the benefits fraud racket in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. In its statement calling the protest, the PN said the scandal had benefitted the Labour Party to the detriment of the rest of the Maltese and Gozitans. These benefits were abusively distributed by the Labour government. It said this was so much the case that it did not want Parliament to meet with urgency to discuss this matter of national importance and reply to the people's many question. It called on the people to go in front of Parliament and unite in protest at 6.30pm on Monday to show their disapproval to the government's actions and attitude. ""Because the people deserve better. They deserve a better life in Malta,"" the PN statement said.     You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

"All necessary steps being taken to tackle benefits fraud scandal, OPM says",Times of Malta,"The authorities were taking all the necessary steps to tackle the benefits fraud scandal, the Office of the Prime Minister said on Sunday, as it asked for the latest claims to be substantiated. Its statement followed an interview in Times of Malta with three of the illicit benefit recipients, including a man who said a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide had lured him into the racket in return for his vote and a kickback. The interview followed the newspaper's revelations a week ago that former Labour MP Silvio Grixti has been implicated in a years-long racket to help “hundreds” of people fraudulently receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to.  RELATED STORIES  The OPM reiterated on Sunday that it had immediately reported the benefits abuse to the police as soon as it became aware something could be amiss back in 2021. This was proof it did not tolerate illegality, the OPM said. It added that political decisions were taken as soon as it became known how the investigation was developing. Neither did it result that anyone at Castille’s customer care had directed anyone to do anything illegal, the OPM insisted. It said the people Times of Malta spoke to had already been investigated by the authorities. The government, however, encouraged them to come up with proof, including names, to substantiate their claims and help the police in the investigation. The people referred to by those interviewed should face justice, the OPM added. Only in this way could the truth be separated from comments and insinuations intended for political gain. Several groundless accusations had been made over the last few days and some of them had been withdrawn. This clearly showed, the OPM said, that people were using the case for ulterior motives and wanted to manipulate information. Moreover, the government was not just interested in justice but in strengthening its systems to reduce the possibility of abuse. Already there were robust systems in place against abuse at the Social Security Department and the Financial Aid and Observance Division. In fact it was through them that a number of suspected cases had been identified and passed on to the police. However, the government felt there should be an evaluation of the processes to further strengthen them where necessary, the OPM said. That was why the government had appointed an independent board to evaluate how benefits for disability were granted. The OPM also cited the introduction of measures aimed at making work pay in order to reduce dependence on social benefits. And it was determined that social benefits should be granted only to those who deserved them. The OPM described as groundless the opposition’s allegation of abuse linked to the buying of votes. Action on the case had already been taken before the last election. What was sure, the OPM said, was that the authorities had taken and would continue to take all the necessary steps, contrary to what used to be done under previous administrations. Earlier on Sunday, the PN asked for Parliament to be recalled to debate the scandal. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

PN calls for urgent parliamentary debate on benefits scandal,Times of Malta,"Updated 3pm, adds leader of the House reply The Nationalist Party has called for parliament to convene urgently on Monday to debate the benefits fraud scandal.   Times of Malta revealed last Sunday that  former Labour MP Silvio Grixti, a popular family doctor, has been implicated in a years-long racket to help “hundreds” of people receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to.  RELATED STORIES  The claimants received monthly payments averaging €450 from the social security department. One claimant has since told Times of Malta that a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the racket in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. The PN said on Sunday that the scandal had benefitted the Labour Party to the detriment of the rest of the Maltese and Gozitans. These benefits were abusively distributed by the Labour government.   In a letter to the Speaker, PN leader Bernard Grech described the situation as “unprecedented”. The reveleations, which were the result of journalistic work, clearly indicated that the racket operated from the Office of the Prime Minister at Castille, Grech said. He said that if the prime minister really has democracy at heart, the matter should be debated with urgency in Parliament as soon as possible.  Attached files  In a reply, leader of the House Chris Fearne said the PN's letter was baseless and ignored the most basic facts. The government, he said, had already appointed a board to evaluate the award of the severe disability benefit and this board's report would immediately be tabled and scheduled for a debate in Parliament. Fearne said facts showed that it was the Prime Minister himself, who, back in 2021, had referred the case to the police. This was the best proof that the OPM was not willing to tolerate any illegality, contrary to the allegations the leader of the Opposition was making in his letter. It was also ironic that the request was made by a leader of the Opposition who, when faced with the most serious accusations, had failed to do anything. Moreover, when it became known how the police investigations were developing, the Prime Minister immediately took the political decisions that were needed without delay. The police were investigating what the media had reported and the government again appealed to those who had the necessary proof against those who abused to take this to the police. This was the only way that justice could be done. In the past years, Fearne said, the government had reduced dependence on social benefits by increasing work and introducing incentives to encourage the people to work. It also attacked benefit abuse. There were now around 60% less people than there had been under the Nationalist government who were dependent on social benefits, Fearne said.

Benefit fraud: A scandal that will not stop - Roberta Metsola,Times of Malta,"Updated 12.25pm, adds David Casa's post on X European Parliament president Roberta Metsola on Sunday called for zero-tolerance to corruption describing the benefit fraud scandal as one “that will not stop”. In a post on Facebook, she said The Sunday Times of Malta had exposed a scandal and “it is as rotten as we thought.” Times of Malta revealed last Sunday that ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti has been implicated in a years-long racket to help “hundreds” of people fraudulently receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to.  RELATED STORIES  Evidence seen by Times of Malta indicates Grixti, a popular family doctor, provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive monthly social benefits for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. The fraud saw the claimants receive monthly payments averaging €450 from the social security department. Times of Malta has now interviewed three of the illicit benefit recipients, including a man who said a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the benefits fraud racket in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. Metsola said the scandal is far more than simply benefit fraud.  “The scandal that lurks beneath is vast and organised. It's corruption designed to defraud the most vulnerable. “It's corruption that is organised systematically to enrich the few at the expense of the many. “It's corruption at the highest levels of government. It's corruption in exchange for votes. “It's corruption that this government has allowed to seep into every aspect of their operations.” Once again, she noted, “we've seen zero political responsibility”.  “We've seen more attempts to sweep it under the carpet. To cover up. To protect those at the top. It's the same playbook Malta and Gozo have endured for the last decade.” This, Metsola said, is what happens when corruption is allowed to continue unabated, when the crooks are protected, when politics is seen as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  “Enough. We need zero-tolerance for corruption. We need politicians who protect the public interest. Those who don't, must be held accountable.  “We need to clean up the system. And we will,” she insisted. Nationalist MEP David Casa said on X later that he highest levels of government are implicated in scheme, taking kickbacks off fraudulent disability benefits. ""No accountability for the big fish.

Benefits racket: How did the country’s leaders react?,Jacob Borg,"A Times of Malta report detailing an organised disability racket involving a former Labour MP sent shockwaves through the country.  For one man, however, this was “no new discovery”.  Prime Minister Robert Abela brushed off concerns about the racket, saying the revelations were old news to him.  Abela said he had immediately “taken action” when then MP Silvio Grixti was questioned by police in December 2021 over forged medical documents.   RELATED STORIES  No public announcement about the suspected racket was ever made by Abela.  Moreover, the social security department said it only got to know about the racket nine months later, in September 2022.  The Ministry for Social Policy, headed by Michael Falzon, said last September that the Income Support and Compliance Division (ISCD) detected suspicious severe disability assistance applications and alerted the police to possible forged medical certificates. Abela claims it was his office that first alerted the police to a potentially suspicious case, and Grixti was forced to resign as an MP.  When contacted, a spokesperson for Abela did not elaborate on when the prime minister first informed Falzon about the racket.  On Saturday, Falzon’s ministry appointed a three-man board to assess the disability benefits scheme.  Opposition leader Bernard Grech demanded a police probe into how the Labour Party potentially gained from the racket.  Many of those falsely certified as suffering from severe disabilities like epilepsy hailed from Labour strongholds. Grech insisted the police have an obligation to probe who ultimately benefits when such rackets are uncovered.  “If we have these allegations and people are being charged in court with taking social benefits that they shouldn’t have, if this is true, are the police only going to charge the small fry?” Grech questioned. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to, with police also charging claimants by the dozen in court.  Grixti has yet to be prosecuted.  Grech said the police must probe those higher up in the alleged fraud, saying those who facilitated it “clearly did it to secure people’s votes”.  The president of Malta’s Medical Association Martin Balzan said the scale of the racket looks like organised crime.  “The scale of this suggests it came from above... to me, this sounds like organised crime,” said Balzan, who discovered that his signature has been forged on around six or seven documents. “Cheating the system is wrong. That money is for people who have a serious disability,” the MAM president said. Balzan said “large numbers” of his colleagues had been impacted, with multiple documents being forged at one go.  “Certain things were blatant. It happened to a lot of specialists. “I’m very happy that the police investigated this. We need to go after the perpetrators and not just the beneficiaries,” Balzan said. The Chamber of Commerce warned that systematic abuses were costing millions in public funds that could easily be invested in systems that would eradicate the possibility of rackets.  It slammed politicians “who made headlines for the wrong reasons” and called for “a zero-tolerance policy” on abuse. “The pervasiveness of practices that propagate a culture of abuse of power and clientelism puts a heavy onus on the government to urgently implement digital systems that increase efficiency, provide full transparency and ensure fairness,” it said. The chamber said the money being squandered through such rackets could be better used to support those who really need help and to address issues which are leading to the country’s deterioration such as the traffic situation, the lack of investment in utility infrastructure, the shabbiness and proper waste management. Former head of state Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca called for a full review of how benefits are assessed in the wake of the racket revelations.  “It is also crucial that, if we want to rebuild trust in the system, then justice must be served and appropriate action is taken,” Coleiro Preca told Times of Malta. She said it is encouraging that the ministry’s income support and compliance division (ISCD) detected suspicious transactions “but we need to go further”. “We have to review the entire process of how assessments for social benefits are made and ensure that proper checks and balances are in place to deter any potential abuse,” she said.

Editorial: Systemic corruption erodes political trust,Times of Malta,"Often, corrupt actions are incidents or transactions by individuals who abuse entrusted power for private gain. But when corruption becomes systemic, it corrodes institutions, welfare, and democracy.  The social benefits frauds revealed by Times of Malta indicate that corruption is sometimes embedded in the social security management system.  The benefits scam was allegedly perpetrated by a network of politicians and public officials acting according to stable practices and norms and serving political and social functions. This is institutionalised corruption. The full extent of the fraud is still not determined. Many understandably ask whether the known cases are the tip of a corruption iceberg, the bigger part of which remains deeply submerged.  Who can vouch that the abuse of taxpayers’ money is not symptomatic of an entrenched setup involving politicians, senior public servants, and frontline ‘customer care’ officials operating according to well-known ‘corruption operating procedures’ and guarded by political power?  Prime Minister Robert Abela argues that he acted at the political and administrative level on the scam long ago. He seems convinced that no serving MPs are involved in this scam. His reactions to this scandal remain unconvincing.  Martin Balzan, president of the medical association, is correct when he argues that “the scale of this suggests it came from above…to me, this sounds like organised crime”.    Abela should have gone beyond repeating the mantra ‘let the institutions work’. More of the same damage limitation tactics with a fresh lick of paint and a slicker sales pitch will not cut it. He should have condemned this institutional corruption and promised a branch and root reform to eradicate it.  Honest citizens expect the government to use their hard-earned tax money to provide social protection for the weakest in society, guarantee decent living wages, and provide vital public services, including health and education, fair tax distribution, and inclusive growth.  When politicians and their cronies in positions of power abuse taxpayers’ money, people see no dividends from democracy. They increasingly lose trust in democratic institutions. There are too many examples of abuse of taxpayers’ money, even under Abela’s watch.  There is a risk that our society will increasingly become one based on pretence, where everyone is defrauding everyone else.  If determined political action is not taken, some will argue that being upright is almost impossible. The honest will suffer. It would be a race to the bottom where no one is really winning.  If our society is to thrive, our political leaders must declare war on the bottomless pit of corruption in the form of nepotism, bribery, patronage, collusion, and other corrupt practices.  The obstinate prevalence of corruption in the last seve­ral years is one of the most perturbing thorns in the country’s flesh.  While the police must continue to press on with criminal charges against those suspected of defrauding taxpayers, politi­cal leaders have a more onerous obligation to rid the political system of sleaze.  Corruption has multiple causes. Like water, it seeps to lower ground and naturally gravitates towards real power. Politicians must not be content with just observing the law.  They must go further and hardwire integrity in the political process. Integrity and corruption are conceptually linked: one is the obverse of the other.  The prime minister must stop acting like a lawyer defending the political party he leads with legalistic arguments.  He must start working like a statesman to restore people’s trust in the political system. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Watch: 'I got €450 a month in exchange for my vote and a kickback',Mark Laurence Zammit,"A man who received illicit disability money says a Labour Party canvasser and a former minister’s aide lured him into the benefits fraud racket, in return for his vote and a kickback amounting to a year’s worth of benefits. Speaking to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity, the man – a long-time Labour supporter – said he became disgruntled around a year before the 2022 election because the party would not help him with something he believed he had a right for. The man, who is among dozens questioned by police and is expected to be charged in court, said: “I was so angry I began to tell people I would not vote in the next election. I made it clear to my friends and even to people in the party. Then one day I got a call from a party canvasser, who was also a minister’s aide a few years back, and he asked me what was wrong,” the man recalled. “When I explained to him, he said, ‘Oh, come on, do go vote, there’s a pension you can apply for. You’ll get more than €400 a month for nothing.’ “I was not sure at the beginning, but he assured me it was safe and I was blinded by it. I took the benefit and I kept my word and voted Labour again.” He claimed that in return, the man asked him for a kickback – the first year’s worth of disability payments.   “I didn’t keep any money the first year. Every benefit I received, I would give directly to him. “I only started keeping the money for myself after I gave him all the money I received during the first year. “And many other people were lured into the scheme like me.” Like dozens of other fraudulent beneficiaries, the man is now risking criminal charges and is prepared to return all the money he received. He is convinced however, that he will have to cough up even more than the amount he kept, because it is probably impossible to retrieve the kickback money. Senior police sources have confirmed with Times of Malta that investigators are looking into the potential role of one or more middlemen who were allegedly pushing the racket to spread among voters while cashing in on the ill-gotten gains. Times of Malta revealed last Sunday that ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti has been implicated in a years-long racket to help “hundreds” of people fraudulently receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to. Evidence seen by Times of Malta indicates Grixti, a popular family doctor, provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive monthly social benefits for severe disabilities they did not suffer from. The fraud saw the claimants receive monthly payments averaging €450 from the social security department. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to, but the figure is expected to climb even higher as police continue to comb through all 761 applications that were awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022. Sources said the racket could have begun even before 2019 and the scheme did not just implicate Grixti. They say the racket became renowned enough within Labour circles to take a life of its own, with some claimants telling police they obtained the forged certificates from people other than Grixti. The man who spoke to Times of Malta was one of them. “I never went to Grixti. The party canvasser gave me the envelope with the documents but I didn’t know what it contained or where he got it from,” he said. Some claimants, on the other hand, have told police they were referred to Grixti by a minister, a minister’s aide or from the customer care section at Castille, the prime minister’s office. Both the Office of the Prime Minister and the ministers deny ever referring people to engage in fraudulent activity. Another woman who received money she was not entitled to insisted with Times of Malta that she was sent to Grixti by the Office of the Prime Minister’s customer care section. A multitude of illnesses and surgeries landed her family in a very tight spot, she said, and her ailing health forced her at times to choose whether to buy food or medicine. She tried to apply for the same benefit through her family doctor more than once and was rejected every time, because she was not eligible for it.   “I was desperate and began to ask around for a social benefit that would help my family financially. I even went to Castille’s customer care section, where they told me to go to Dr Grixti because he can help me,” she said. “And they specifically told me to tell him that I was being referred to him from Castille.” Not fully aware what this meant, she went to Grixti and told him about her medical and financial struggles and that she was referred to him from Castille. “It was like he knew about me and knew exactly why I went there. With a smile he told me to sit down, filled in some papers and told me to take them to the social security department. “That doctor saved my life.” She said Grixti never asked her to vote for him or the party, did not charge her for the service and never even implied that this was a favour that needed to be returned in some way. When she insisted on paying him, he told her he was doing it simply to help. Grixti has so far declined to comment when contacted via his lawyers Franco Debono and Arthur Azzopardi. The woman now wants to return all the money but is aware that this will likely land her into the poverty trap once more. Another man who spoke to Times of Malta this week admitted, however, that he knew exactly what the racket was all about and decided to try his luck after hearing about it from a friend.    He claimed that he suffered from mental health problems, but not the kind that would make him eligible for the severe disability benefit. “They assured me things would go smoothly and nobody will be caught,” he said, adding that he now feels guilty for what he did and has already returned the full amount to the social security department. People who apply for the severe disability benefit must take their documents for an interview before a government-appointed medical board that is tasked with assessing the validity of the applications before approving the applicant for the benefit. But the people who spoke to Times of Malta noted how the interview before the medical board felt hasty. The applicants passed on forged documents to the board members who failed to notice anything wrong with them. “I gave them the papers, they read through them and said I could go. It lasted around five minutes,” the woman said. Another of the beneficiaries said: “It took four to five minutes. They asked me a few questions and that was it.” The other man said: “Mine was two minutes. They asked me to confirm that I suffered from the condition, I said yes and that was it.” On Saturday, the Social Policy Ministry said that a three-person board led by retired judge Antonio Mizzi would look into the way in which assessments were made, to identify weaknesses and recommend changes. The ministry has previously acknowledged that it knew of the allegations back in September 2022.    Police investigations revealed that the packet of documents they handed over to the medical board contained forged medical certificates appearing to confirm that the patients suffered from a condition they did not have.  RELATED STORIES  The certificates appeared to be signed by consultants who later confirmed they had never examined the patients and that their signature was forged for the purpose of the racket. In many cases, the packet also contained a forged Transport Malta document appearing to confirm the applicant had forfeited their driving licence because the condition made them unfit to drive. The people who spoke to Times of Malta all confirmed they continued to drive normally and were never asked to return their licence. A few weeks after the board interview all of them started to receive payments averaging €450 monthly. The three individuals who spoke to Times of Malta said they feel cheated and hurt, and they fear the “big fish in the racket” might get away with it and never face justice. “I feel guilty. I feel I was used so they would get what they wanted,” one man said. “A fish usually stinks from the head, and there is no way one man alone with his patients could have pulled a scheme of this magnitude. “I hope the other people involved are caught because it’s not fair to ruin the vulnerable people and leave the powerful ones untouched.” The people who spoke to Times of Malta did not mention the names of the people who got them into the racket, saying that either they did not know the name or else that they feared exposing the names would put them in danger.

Editorial: There are too many holes in our border control,Times of Malta,"When, a year ago, it emerged that a former gaming consultant was able to leave the island a number of times notwithstanding a European arrest warrant hanging over his head Times of Malta had raised the issue of border control. “The public,” it had observed, “does not know to what extent Malta’s ports are exposed because of what appears to be an inadequate reporting system within the police force about wanted people, whether Maltese or foreign nationals.” The removal of the old embarkation card system as Malta had moved closer to EU membership and, subsequently, the introduction of the passport-free Schengen Area provoked a discussion on effective monitoring over who is entering and leaving the country. The idea to have as little barriers as possible was, of course, positive, aimed at facilitating travel and trade across Europe. However, the lack of checks at borders did raise the spectre of bad apples, such as criminals and terrorists, being able to move with ease from one country to another to escape detection and also capture. This state of affairs necessitated close and persistent coordination between all relevant authorities – including intelligence sharing – as well as robust security measures in place to still be able to manage and secure borders. The ‘disappearance’ from Malta of a man defined by a magistrate as “a lethal weapon” ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated” makes law-abiding citizens wonder whether something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   Such fears are justified when considering that Jomic Calleja Maatouk had failed to sign the bail book for days before it was realised he had gone missing. The police only started looking for him when his partner’s brother and then her grandmother raised the alarm. The court’s description of him indicates the man should be considered “armed and dangerous”. At law, he is still presumed innocent even though he was convicted by the magistrates’ court of importing explosives and trying to buy lethal poisons over the dark web. This is because he has appealed from the five-year jail sentence handed down in July. Added to that the man’s long criminal record and a history of absconding, it boggles the mind how the police and the security service do not appear to have kept a very close eye on him. Similarly, it is unclear why – after he submitted his appeal – the attorney general did not ask for stricter bail conditions. Calleja Maatouk, thought to have fled the country by sea, now features on Europe’s list of most wanted fugitives. When, last year, gaming consultant Iosip Galea was arrested in Italy as he was wanted in Germany, it transpired he was able to travel out of Malta with some ease even if he was the subject of two European arrest warrants. An internal inquiry subsequently found that the German request for the man’s arrest was ignored on three occasions by the head of the police bureau handling such matters. Two officers were declared to have failed in their duties, one of them deeming the inquiry a mere “public relations exercise”. And, so it seems, judging by the latest case, even if the circumstances are not identical. This scenario can only bring to the fore the matter of electronic tagging and whether the law providing for a stay of a sentence handed down by a magistrate but not a judge needs urgent revision. There are evidently too many ‘holes’ in Malta’s border control regime. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Ex-president calls for review of benefits system after racket exposed,Mark Laurence Zammit,"Former president and social security minister Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca has called for a full review of how benefits are assessed after Times of Malta exposed a huge racket that allowed hundreds of people to cheat the system. The ex-head of State and long-time Labour MP said the detail of the revelations destroyed trust, hurt those who most need help and were “a blow to the system of solidarity”. She spoke out after revelations that ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti helped hundreds of people get monthly severe disability benefits they were not entitled to through forged documents. “It is also crucial that, if we want to rebuild trust in the system, then justice must be served and appropriate action is taken,” Coleiro Preca told Times of Malta. She said it is encouraging that the ministry’s income support and compliance division (ISCD) detected suspicious transactions “but we need to go further”. “We have to review the entire process of how assessments for social benefits are made and ensure that proper checks and balances are in place to deter any potential abuse,” she said.   “Correct information about eligibility criteria to access benefits should be widely disseminated and policies should be transparent and accountable. We need to ensure information about all aspects of the process, from policy development to the implementation level, are accessible to ensure an equitable, fair and just outcome. Coleiro Preca was family and social solidarity minister between 2013 and 2014 and, during her tenure, appointed Grixti to a medical board that was tasked with validating applications for social benefits. However, according to sources, the forging of documents appears to have started after he had stopped serving on the board. The years-long racket saw people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, receive around €450 monthly, collectively defrauding millions in taxpayer money. Following the revelations, the social policy ministry confirmed some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to. But that figure is expected to climb even higher as the police continue to comb through all 761 applications awarded the benefit between 2019 and 2022.   Coleiro Preca, who served as head of State from 2014 to 2019 and now leads The Malta Trust Foundation, which helps support vulnerable people, said she was concerned about the impact on those who need the benefit. “I am particularly worried about how vulnerable individuals, who are genuinely seeking social benefits to mitigate hardships emanating from sickness and other social conditions will be impacted due to this investigation,” she said. “Unfortunately, those who are honest and genuinely in need of social benefits now risk being perceived as abusers and fraudulent, which will have a traumatising effect on them.” Coleiro Preca urged the media to protect vulnerable individuals and their families as they delve deeper into the story and to ensure that, through reporting, they are “not discriminated against or made to feel like criminals”. Dozens of claimants who benefitted from the racket have already been charged and more people are expected to be arraigned in the coming weeks and investigators are not excluding the possibility that the racket could have begun even before 2019.

'You'll end up like Bernice': man jailed for threatening to kill ex partner,Edwina Brincat,"A drug addict who constantly bombarded his ex-partner with demands for money, threatening that she would “end up like Bernice” and that their three children would “be motherless” has been jailed for three and a half years.  The 41-year-old Tarxien resident whose name is being withheld to protect the identity of his victim and their children - two of whom are minors - was arrested after the woman reported him to the police in March. That was her second report against the man whom court was told on Wednesday has been gripped by a serious drug problem for 15 years.  The woman's first report was filed in October 2022, and the man had allegedly smashed her car windscreen after he learnt she had reported him to the police.    The long-suffering woman poured out her troubles to the police, describing her ex’s constant demands for money to fuel his drug addiction.  She tried to keep him calm, hoping to stop the situation from escalating further. That was why she answered his persistent calls and handed him money - between €60 to €120 daily - later testifying that she “always tried to protect the children”. “What could I do?” the woman remarked.  The couple had been estranged for five years but the harassment escalated after the man got to know that his ex had dined with a male friend.  He grew obsessed with the thought that she had a relationship with that man so his calls increased in frequency and intensity.  On March 16, she received three calls from her ex between 9.22pm and 9.47pm. Those calls were made from his friend’s mobile.  Two days later,  her ex rang her doorbell early in the morning. She immediately called the police but he had left by the time they arrived.  At 6am, she headed to the domestic violence unit to file her second report which resulted in her ex’s arrest.  He was subsequently charged with causing her fear of violence, subjecting her to moral and psychological violence, harassment as well as insults and threats.  The woman’s version was supported by three recordings of telephone conversations with the accused who knew that she was sometimes recording him.  Their eldest daughter, who refused to speak to her father, also corroborated her mother’s version.  'Domestic violence victims often prefer to suffer in silence' The defence questioned why the alleged victim kept answering the accused’s calls and handing him money, thus further fueling his addiction rather than seeking police help immediately.  However, the court, presided over by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, shot down that argument observing that “it was easy to argue in that manner in a purely clinical context” where emotions did not play a part.  It was different for a domestic violence victim who knew that her report would likely result in criminal action and jail for the father of her children.  “It’s a fact that domestic violence victims often prefer to suffer in silence, sometimes for years, rather than report to the police for various reasons including fear of retaliation by the aggressor and [the fear] that matters would take a turn for the worse.”  The accused had smashed his ex’s car windscreen after she reported him the first time. He would tell her that he “pitied the kids because they would end up motherless because of her”. He threatened to shoot her and that “she would end up like Bernice”.  Bernice Cassar was allegedly shot dead by her estranged husband in Corradino in November of last year. On Wednesday the court concluded that the prosecution had proved its case and condemned the man to a three and a half years jail term, less the time spent in preventive custody.  The accused had a criminal record marred by 14 convictions and he had wasted previous opportunities, refusing to enter rehabilitation to quit his drug problem, insisting that he could do it alone.  But he evidently needed help and that was available within the confines of prison, said the Magistrate, also issuing a three-year restraining order that would take effect once he had served his sentence.  Inspectors Omar Zammit and Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted.  You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails. We use Mailchimp as our marketing platform.

Cleaner to face sentencing again after judgment quashed over technicality,Edwina Brincat,"A cleaner handed a three-year jail term after admitting to stealing from two private residences, will face sentencing afresh after the first judgment was annulled over a 'formal defect' in the date.  Seliam Ann Elbueshi Perry, 43, was found guilty upon admission to the two aggravated thefts which took place between September 2017 and March 2018 from two private apartments in Sliema and Msida.  She was handed a three-year effective jail term by a Magistrates’ Court.  Her new lawyers, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, filed an appeal, requesting the court to deliver a fairer and more equitable punishment.  The appeal was assigned to Mr Justice Neville Camilleri in January 2023.  When delivering judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that the date on the first judgment was “May 2019”. But that date was crossed out between parallel lines and another date, “ November 2, 2021” was handwritten next to it. There was nothing to indicate that that correction had been duly authorised. The corresponding court minute dated November 2, 2019, stated that the case had been decided and judgment delivered that day.  Although not every error or inaccuracy in a judgment results in nullity, the date on a judgment was not “an unnecessary formalism but an essential element since it provided certainty as to the time of sentencing”, observed the judge.  Such an obvious requisite, although not listed as one of the formal requisites under Article 382 of the Criminal Code, was essential because it ensured the proper administration of justice.  The date defined the time limit for appealing the judgment and also served as the starting point for the legal consequences of a conviction to enter into effect.  That was why a clear indication of the date was indispensable and the absence thereof was deemed as a breach of a rule of public order, that could be flagged by the court ex officio.  Citing jurisprudence on the matter, the court concluded that the judgment was to be revoked, pointing out, however, that it was not the entire proceedings that were being annulled.  The records of the case were to be sent back to the Magistrates’ Court for the appellant to be placed in the position she was in immediately prior to sentencing.

Femicide suspect Roderick Cassar denied bail again,Matthew Xuereb,"A man who stands accused of murdering his estranged wife, Roderick Cassar, will continue to be held in preventive custody after a court once again denied his request for bail. Mr Justice Neville Camilleri rejected Cassar’s third request for bail after expressing doubts about whether he would abide by the bail conditions imposed on him. Cassar stands accused of stalking then shooting his wife Bernice in the head and chest in Triq il-Baċir, Paola on November 22 last year. It is the first case of murder with femicidal intent in Maltese criminal history. Prosecutors say that apart from murdering his wife and fleeing to his house in Qrendi, Cassar also used violence against her, stole her mobile phone and car keys, breached a protection order and harassed her. Cassar, they add, did not have a permit to use the shotgun he allegedly shot her with. The 42-year-old is pleading not guilty to all those charges. According to doctors, her cause of death was a gunshot to her face. Witnesses told police that the mother-of-two was dragged from her car by her estranged husband who then allegedly took a shotgun from his own vehicle and shot her twice in the chest and face. In a fresh application for bail, filed on Wednesday, his defence lawyers argued that the compilation of evidence against their client had now reached an advanced stage and only secondary witnesses still had to testify. They argued that their client satisfied the legal requirements to be granted bail and that although the public outcry caused by the alleged crime should be taken into consideration, it should not be the only element on which the court ought to decide on bail. The public outcry is something that will never change but this did not automatically mean that Cassar should never be released from preventive custody. They said the accused’s elderly father, John Cassar, was willing to step in as third-party guarantor. In their reply, prosecuting lawyers Angele Vella, Darlene Grima and Anthony Vella, from the Attorney General’s office, said that although he was presumed innocent until proven guilty, the crime with which he was accused was allegedly committed in breach of a protection order. This and the fact that he spent 17 hours disobeying police orders until he was eventually arrested on the day of the murder shows that he is not trustworthy and does not offer the necessary guarantees that he will respect the bail conditions. The lawyers said he also fled the scene of the crime so there was nothing stopping him from absconding. The prosecution reminded the court that the accused had threatened his wife's family and had posted on social media that “revenge is a must”. “All of you will pay for it, from Żebbuġ to Santa Luċija,” Cassar had allegedly menaced. It said there was a real fear that the accused would commit another crime and that this alone led to public alarm and disquiet. At a bail hearing on Thursday, the court also heard lawyers representing Bernice Cassar’s relatives about their fear of Cassar being granted bail. After hearing submissions and considering the presumption of innocence on one hand and the public interest and public outcry caused by the crime on the other hand, the court turned down the request since it was not convinced that the accused would abide by bail conditions. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Jacob Magri are defence counsel. Lawyers Marita Pace Dimech and Ann Marie Cutajar appeared parte civile.

"Żurrieq jeweller found in 'pool of blood' after pre-planned attack, court hears",Edwina Brincat,"A woman involved in the trio who allegedly attacked and left for dead the owner of a Żurrieq jewelry shop had hinted to a fellow inmate at Corradino about the intended robbery a few weeks beforehand, a court heard. Joe Carabott, 67, was beaten unconscious after he called out for help during the robbery, the inspector leading the investigation told the court on Thursday. Details of the plot, which left the victim fighting for his life, emerged at the first hearing of the compilation of evidence against Donna Borg Sciberras, Mohamed Anas Boualam and Zouhair Hadoumi who deny attempted murder and violent aggravated theft. During lengthy testimony, prosecuting inspector Lydon Zammit told the court how investigators pieced together evidence, ultimately tracking down the suspects to an abandoned house metres away from the Sliema police station. He described how the victim was found face down, his head in a pool of blood and unconscious. The court heard how the family of the 67-year-old owner of the jewellery shop on Dun Ġuzepp Zammit became concerned after he failed to call for his wife as planned at around 7.15pm on August 25. His son headed to the shop to check, finding the shutter of the shop down and the front door closed.  He somehow managed to open the shutter, just enough to catch sight of his father, lying on the floor in the back of the shop, slightly moving his bound feet and making some sound.  Police and paramedics were alerted and smashed a side shop window to gain access to the victim who had head injuries. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and in danger of dying.    Two large safes inside the back room were open and so was another smaller safe. Gold items were missing from the showcases and the cash register drawer was also emptied.  The inspector said that CCTV footage showed the suspects were not masked and although one of them wore a cap, their faces were visible. Borg Sciberras, whose face was familiar in police circles, was the first to be identified, followed by Anas.  Investigators discovered the trio had reached Żurrieq that evening after booking a cab through a number, whose owner was 'Anas'. They were dropped off near the parish church, walked towards their destination and crossed the street opposite the shop.    Some twenty minutes later, they stepped out again and pulled down the shutter, then headed on foot to Blue Grotto Avenue where they left in another taxi.  That second taxi was not booked, with the driver calling out to Anas, saying his name, and all three got in. They returned to a Żebbuġ residence from where they first headed out earlier that afternoon.  When it was searched, a resident told police that Anas lived there in a downstairs room which he had lately been sharing with a woman called Donna.    Inside that residence, police found a bag of 620 ecstasy pills and a jacket that matched one seen in footage from the crime scene, as well as a small white price tag like others seen at the shop. They also found a tiny studded earring and a small pearl just beneath the front doorstep.  As more information came in, police eventually tracked the trio to an abandoned residence on Manuel Dimech Street Sliema, just metres away from the police station.  They later discovered that the place had formerly been the home of Hadoumi’s mother.  When the officers forced their way in at around 7.15pm on Sunday, they found Borg Sciberras on the roof of the neighbouring building and Hadoumi was caught in the garden of another abandoned building some five roofs away. Anas was holed up in a small space.  As police searched the house where the suspects appeared to have been living, they came across a black handbag containing €1,785 in cash and a manbag with €440 in cash.  Inside that manbag was a gold cross, another white price tag like the ones in the shop and the Zebbuġ residence along with Hadoumi’s personal documents.  Inside a black haversack on a bed, police found two wrist watches.  One of those was later identified by a customer who had dropped off two watches for repairs at the victim’s shop, shortly before the robbery.  The victim had placed the watches in a black pouch he usually carried around with him, containing his wallet, ID card and other personal items.  That pouch was subsequently retrieved by a third party who spotted it in the sea as he headed his boat into the Msida marina and took it to the police station.  A small red hammer was found in the black pouch. Inside the Sliema house police found a bag containing gold items and small boxes stamped with the jeweller’s logo and Zurrieq address.  More of the same kind of boxes were later discovered in another abandoned building opposite the marina in Pieta, but no gold was found there.  Anas denied that he was the one who beat the victim, saying that he was on site.  Hadoumi supplied more information, explaining how he met the other two at a Sliema cafeteria a couple of days before the robbery.  He was told about the plot and on that Friday, they called him to join them at the Żebbuġ residence from where Anas booked the cab that drove them to Żurrieq.  He blamed Anas for the beating and described the dynamics of the robbery.  When he and Borg Sciberras entered the shop, they hit the victim with the handle of a knife hidden in her bosom. She later denied that, Inspector Zammit said. His role was to help tie up the victim, smash the showcases and seize the valuables, Hadoumi claimed.  He also described how his “burlier” accomplice had allegedly been called for assistance and had grabbed the victim by the neck, floored him and beat him up.  Borg Sciberras told police that they had got the shop’s location through Google Maps and also that a former fellow inmate had told her that there were no security cameras in the shop.  She said that Hadoumi was the one who gave the victim the worst beating. She told police that after they first tied up the victim, he began to shout. That was when he was attacked again. Then for the next 15 minutes or so he made no other reaction. They smashed the showcases with a hammer.  Borg Sciberras said her role was to snatch the gold from the shop window and counter. Mere hours after the robbery, the trio sold some of the booty as they moved from Zebbug, to Pieta and finally to Sliema. In the following hours, Borg Sciberras tattooed the name of one of her accomplices with whom she had a relationship. That name was ‘Anas.’ The inspector told the court that a Corradino inmate who heard about the robbery spoke to a police officer and claimed that Borg Sciberras had hinted to her about the robbery weeks before. Two eyewitnesses also gave evidence before magistrate Ian Farrugia about spotting suspicious people outside the shop at about 6pm on the day of the incident. One resident saw a woman, a thin man and a large man wearing a top with '35' printed on it entering the shop. The resident was able to identify this man in court as Anas. A woman saw two 'suspicious-looking' men leave the shop, speaking a language she did not understand but that was neither Maltese nor English.  At the end of the sitting the court declared that there was sufficient primae facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment.  The case continues in October. Attorney General lawyers Anthony Vella and Kaylie Bonnet prosecuted together with Inspectors Lydon Zammit, Stephen Gulia, Jonathan Cassar and Sean Pawney. Legal aid lawyers Brandon Muscat, Mark Mifsud Cutajar and Maria Karlsson are assisting the accused. Lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Ana Thomas appeared on behalf of the victim.

Benefit fraud: Key officials in EU institutions alerted to criminal racket,Times of Malta,"MEP David Casa has alerted key officials in EU institutions to the organised criminal racket implicating Labour supporters and government officials. On Sunday, Times of Malta revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with Grixti implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million in severe disability assistance benefits they were not entitled to. The figure is expected to grow. Casa said the ""sophisticated"" benefit fraud scheme implicated members of the governing Labour Party. “The facts of this case are simply revolting and Robert Abela has shown where his priorities lie in the fight against corruption,” Casa charged.  Addressing the key rule of law figures in the EU, Casa stressed that the criminal enterprise is not to be seen in isolation, but “joins a list of incessant, unresolved cases of wrongdoing, which the Maltese public has to endure on a daily basis.” The only way this could have been accomplished, explained Casa, was through “government services being completely hijacked and systemically compromised so as to allow the fraud to proceed without question.” Casa slammed the “concerted criminal effort to defraud the taxpayer and manipulate elections”, which has cost the taxpayer millions of euro. He emphasised that while hundreds of criminals were being quietly exposed, the big fish continued to elude prosecution two years after the racket was first detected. Casa presented the case to the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, vice-president Věra Jourová, and to the chair of the Democracy, Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights Monitoring Group within the European Parliament. He called for the facts to be taken seriously failing, any good faith action on the part of the Maltese government. “The only traitors are those who betrayed their oath of public service, not only to tarnish their country's reputation, but to undermine the very processes on which our democracy is based. I will not be threatened by scoundrels and thieves in fulfilling my obligations to my electorate,” Casa stated. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

PN calls on Abela to 'take on political responsibility' for benefits racket,Giulia Magri,"Prime Minister Robert Abela must shoulder political responsibility for the social benefits racket which has so far defrauded taxpayers of €2.1 million, the Nationalist Party said on Wednesday.  PN MP Paula Mifsud Bonnici said one aim of the fraud was for the Labour Party could steal votes and steal thousands of euros from people’s pockets.  “We are calling on Prime Minister Robert Abela to take on political responsibility,” she said.  “What more does Abela know about this fraud? It seems that unfortunately, after many hours since the details of the racket have come out, we have a prime minister, who has nothing to say. A prime minister who is scared to take on responsibility.”   Times of Malta on Sunday revealed that hundreds of people were being investigated for fraudulently claiming monthly benefit payments averaging €450, with ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti, implicated as having allegedly provided false medical documents to back up the claims. Some 141 people have so far been ordered to return a total of €2.1 million, while hundreds more are still under investigation.  Evidence seen by Times of Malta indicates that many of the claimants hailed from Labour strongholds like Żabbar, Żejtun and Paola. On Tuesday evening, Abela said that no sitting MP is involved in the racket and that Castille had immediately taken action when it received reports of the allegations. Mifsud Bonnici said the Labour government is built on ways to buy votes and steal money from the public, rather than working on ensuring there is enough help for the public, especially those who need it. She also criticised Social Policy Minister, Michael Falzon, for his silence on the racket.  “Why do we have a minister, a veteran minister who has had this portfolio for many years, who is also silent,” she asked. “The ministry gave us details about how many people have been ordered to return the money, yet it failed to give us details about who, in the first place, gave this money to people who did not need it.” She said it was clear that there were people involved in this benefit fraud scheme who deal with people every day, people involved in customer care of the minister and Castille customer care.  “I ask Michael Falzon, are you checking who these people are? Are they in your department? In your ministry? In Castille?"" Fellow PN MP Claudette Buttigieg asked why there is no magisterial inquiry on this fraudulent benefit scheme that has disgusted and angered the public.  “No one has any doubt that this was set up by a criminal organisation, it was structured to ensure that you offer people something, these benefits, and you steal your vote,” she said. She said she knew of many specialists who had their names on these fake documents, and they are ""extremely disgusted"".  She also called for public service workers involved in this racket to ""come clean"". “How can it be no one realised the large numbers of people gaining from these benefits?” When asked by journalists if any PN MP is part of the abuse, Mifsud Bonnici appealed to the police to carry out their investigations and bring anyone forward who is responsible for this fraud deal.

Far-right Proud Boys leader gets 22 years for US Congress attack,AFP,"Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys militia, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, the stiffest sentence handed out so far. ""That day broke our previously unbroken tradition of peacefully transferring power,"" US District Judge Timothy Kelly said of the attempt to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Donald Trump. ""Mr Tarrio was the ultimate leader of the conspiracy,"" Kelly said during a nearly four-hour sentencing hearing in the nation's capital. Prosecutors had sought a 33-year prison term for Tarrio, who was not in Washington on January 6 but was accused of directing the military-style assault on the Capitol by members of the Proud Boys and other supporters of the former president. The 39-year-old Tarrio and several other members of the Proud Boys were convicted of seditious conspiracy in May for their roles in the attack. Another member of the Proud Boys, Ethan Nordean, 32, received an 18-year prison sentence from Kelly last week. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of another far-right militia central to the Capitol siege, the Oath Keepers, was also sentenced to 18 years in prison earlier this year. Tarrio addressed the court before the sentence was handed down and said January 6 was a ""national embarrassment."" ""My candidate lost,"" he said. ""I persisted when I should have calmed."" Tarrio, who appeared to choke up on several occasions, apologized to members of law enforcement who were attacked by rioters on what he called a ""horrible day."" ""I failed miserably,"" he said. ""This trial has humbled me."" Prosecutor Conor Mulroe, arguing for the 33-year prison term, said Tarrio and the other members of the Proud Boys ""tried to use force and violence to try and impose their view of what was right for the country."" ""It was Mr Tarrio with the assistance of his codefendants who put this group together,"" Mulroe said.  In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors described Tarrio as a ""savvy propagandist"" and said that while he was not physically present in Washington on January 6 he ""did far more harm than he could have as an individual rioter."" Tarrio had acted as a ""general rather than a soldier,"" they said. ""The only reason Tarrio did not march alongside the others is because he was arrested upon his arrival in Washington DC and placed under a court order to leave the District,"" they added. The assault on Congress left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured and followed a fiery speech by Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the election. Trump is to go on trial in Washington in March on charges of conspiring to overturn the November 2020 election results. He faces similar charges in a separate case in the southern state of Georgia. The 77-year-old Trump was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after the Capitol riot - he was charged with inciting an insurrection - but was acquitted by the Senate. More than 1,100 people have been charged by the Justice Department in the Capitol attack. Some 630 of them have pleaded guilty to various charges, and 110 have been found guilty at trial.
